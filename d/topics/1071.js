In some patients, AT deficiency can be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The availability of plasma-derived AT concentrates and recombinant AT has made it possible to replace AT, but the appropriate clinical uses of these products remain unclear.

It inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other serine proteases in the coagulation cascade such as factor IXa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Control mechanisms and termination of clotting'</a>.)</p><p>AT is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin), a specific type of enzyme inhibitor. AT has a reactive center at position Arg393-Ser394 that interacts with the active site serine residue of the coagulation factor protease, and a heparin-binding site, which is distinct from the reactive center. Following the administration of heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight [LMW]) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, AT activity is accelerated dramatically due to a conformational change leading to enhanced exposure of the reactive center in AT induced by heparin binding. This conformational change converts AT from a slow inactivator of coagulation factors such as thrombin (factor IIa) to a rapid inactivator (1000-fold increase in AT activity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the specific coagulation factor(s) affected depend on the size of the heparin molecule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832 \">figure 3</a>). It is thought that endogenous heparan sulfates in the intact endothelium provide this role in normal physiology, in turn localizing the inhibitor activity of AT to the endothelial surface of blood vessels and maintaining the fluidity of blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. AT may also have other roles such as reducing platelet adhesion to fibrinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The half-life of AT is approximately 2.8 to 4.8 days. Production and turnover of AT both are highly regulated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AT is produced in the liver as a 464 amino acid precursor from which a 32 amino acid signal peptide is cleaved. The signal peptide plays a crucial role in translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum where cotranslational processing takes place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AT is present in plasma in two forms, an active monomer and an inactive &quot;latent&quot; form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One molecule of latent AT can inactivate one molecule of the active AT monomer through the formation of a heterodimer; in health, this process only contributes to the normal turnover of the protein in plasma. However, this process may account for increased thrombosis risk in carriers of rare unstable variants of AT during fever or illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombin cleaves the reactive center of AT, which is followed by the formation of an inactive complex that is rapidly cleared from the circulation.</p><p/><p>Healthy newborns have approximately 50 percent AT activity; this reaches adult levels by approximately six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Plasma levels of AT appear to be similar across ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>AT deficiency can be inherited or acquired. Inherited deficiencies are due to AT gene mutations (see <a href=\"#H2635206705\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below). Acquired deficiencies can result from impaired production of functional AT (eg, due to liver disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy, asparaginase therapy); protein losses (eg, in nephrotic syndrome) or accelerated consumption, as occurs in acute thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). (See <a href=\"#H1104379682\" class=\"local\">'Acquired deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2635206705\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inheritance of AT deficiency is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Children of affected individuals have approximately a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition. Importantly, however, not all individuals with laboratory evidence of AT deficiency will develop thrombosis or require anticoagulation.</p><p>Hundreds of mutations and other genetic alterations (eg, deletions) have been identified in the gene encoding AT (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/107300&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWNPfoxm65x7UZASNqQna/6wBMioOnhLt/OqF7WESVLG2&amp;TOPIC_ID=1360\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SERPINC1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The resulting phenotypes are divided into type I and type II deficiencies, corresponding to reduced levels of AT antigen and activity, or to functionally defective AT present at normal antigen levels, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type I deficiency</strong> &ndash; Type I hereditary AT deficiency (reduced AT level) is usually caused by a small deletion or insertion, a larger deletion, or a single base substitution (mutation). Most of these changes in genetic sequence lead to reduced synthesis of the protein. Other changes may affect the signal peptide and impair post-translational processing or alter AT protein stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/5,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-19</a>]. Homozygous type I deficiency has not been described, and homozygous gene deletion in mice is lethal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type II defects</strong> &ndash; Type II hereditary AT defects (functionally defective AT) are caused by a number of mutations that affect different aspects of protein function. Plasma AT functional activity may be markedly reduced, whereas AT immunologic activity typically is normal. Three subtypes of the type II phenotype have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reactive site defect (type II RS) </strong>&ndash; Variants with decreased activity in AT functional assays generally have mutations near the thrombin binding site at the carboxyterminal end of the molecule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Heparin binding site defect (type II HBS)</strong> &ndash; Heparin binding site defects are the most common type of hereditary AT defect. These defects are also associated with a very low risk of thromboembolic complications compared with other AT defects. Several abnormalities in AT that affect the heparin binding site have been identified; these may lead to isolated reductions in heparin cofactor activity. Affected individuals generally have plasma AT-heparin cofactor activity measurements of approximately 50 percent and normal progressive AT activity. (See <a href=\"#H216417\" class=\"local\">'Choice of assay'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pleiotropic effect mutations (type II PE) </strong>&ndash; The third subtype involves a mutation at the carboxyterminal end of the AT molecule between amino acids 402 to 429. These mutations produce conformational changes in the protein and can exhibit multiple defects including reductions in both heparin binding and progressive AT activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/15-18,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18,20-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relative frequency of these defects depends on patient selection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1104379682\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of conditions lower the concentration of AT in the blood. Many of these are also associated with other alterations in procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, making it challenging to determine what role (if any) the reductions in AT levels play in the associated thrombotic complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis that consumes procoagulant and anticoagulant factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Reports have suggested that more severe AT deficiency in the setting of DIC or sepsis is predictive of worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, this association should not be interpreted to imply causation; for these conditions, the principle treatment involves addressing the underlying disease process.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and hemodialysis have also been associated with reductions in plasma AT levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This may result in ineffective anticoagulation with heparin. Replacement of AT can be accomplished more effectively by administering an AT product rather than by giving Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), but AT replacement has not yet clearly been shown to be efficacious in improving clinical outcomes or prolonging circuit life. Thrombotic risk in these settings may also be attributed to the presence of a central catheter for vascular access.

Major surgery is associated with a modest fall in AT levels, with a nadir around the third postoperative day, followed by an increase to normal around the fifth postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asparaginase therapy reduces synthesis of proteins that contain the amino acid asparagine, including AT. Asparagine-containing chemotherapy regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are associated with an increased thrombotic risk, which may be due to reduced AT in combination with other factors such as glucocorticoid administration, immobilization, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of a central venous catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombosis-in-patients-with-malignancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombosis in patients with malignancy&quot;, section on 'L-asparaginase'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heparins can lower AT activity levels by as much as 30 percent, presumably by causing increased clearance of AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These reductions are not considered to increase thrombotic risk; however, this phenomenon may produce a false positive result in a patient undergoing thrombophilia testing while receiving heparin (ie, it may suggest the patient has hereditary AT deficiency when in fact the reduction is due to heparin therapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76966 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modest reductions in plasma AT concentration are found in users of oral contraceptives and in individuals receiving estrogen for other purposes, but the clinical importance of these changes is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AT levels do not change substantially during normal pregnancies, but they may decrease significantly in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>].

The reduced level of AT (typically, approximately 50 percent of normal, range 40 to 60 percent) is thought to be sufficient to allow excessive thrombin generation and fibrin deposition within the vasculature. This mechanism contrasts with coagulation factor deficiencies, in which heterozygosity for a mutation typically is associated with a benign carrier condition and reduction of plasma activity levels to approximately half of normal rarely confer clinical consequences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insensitivity to heparin is seen in some individuals with AT deficiency (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Heparin resistance'</a> below). This occurs because heparins require AT to inactivate coagulation enzymes. In contrast, direct inhibitors of coagulation enzymes such as direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors do not require AT.</p><p/><p>Antithrombin function is not assessed by routine coagulation tests such as the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT); thus, results of these tests are not affected by AT deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816643\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary AT deficiency (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/613118&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWEQcQ2VFLi2SQdkbnhvNF8w4NJ87nJcq4wJN8fPvuf+U&amp;TOPIC_ID=1360\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">OMIM #613118</a>) is rare; it is significantly less common than the factor V Leiden mutation and the prothrombin G20210A mutation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016 \">table 2</a>).

Estimates of the degree of increased risk vary among populations. A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies showed that compared with controls, AT-deficient individuals had an odds ratio (OR) of VTE of 16.3 (95% CI 9.9-26.7); this was substantially higher than the VTE risk attributed to protein S or protein C deficiency (ORs 5.4 and 7.5, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In studies that focused on thrombophilic families in which at least one member had a history of thrombosis, the risk for VTE in relatives was approximately 1 percent annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Individuals who co-inherit a second thrombophilic defect are likely to have a greater risk.

The most common sites of thrombosis are the deep veins of the leg and the iliofemoral veins and the mesenteric veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/21,52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,52-55</a>].

In a 2016 systematic review that included four case-control studies involving pregnancies in women with and without AT deficiency, the OR for VTE with AT deficiency was 6.1 (95% CI 1.6-23.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 18 percent of patients during pregnancy and in 33 percent in the postpartum period. By comparison, thrombosis during pregnancy occurred in only 7 percent of patients with protein C deficiency and in none of the patients with protein S deficiency. Thrombosis in the postpartum period occurred in 19 percent of protein C and 17 percent of protein S deficient patients. This increased risk provides our rationale for administering AT to some individuals with hereditary AT deficiency who become pregnant, especially around the time of delivery. (See <a href=\"#H259454\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256113\"><span class=\"h3\">Age at presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age of presentation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hereditary AT deficiency varies widely. Although type I AT deficiency (see <a href=\"#H2635206705\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above) is the most clinically penetrant of the inherited thrombophilias, some individuals never have a thromboembolic event in their lifetime. (See <a href=\"#H3165653810\" class=\"local\">'VTE risk'</a> above.)</p><p>Examples of the range of ages at presentation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of 21 children and adolescents with confirmed hereditary AT deficiency, the mean age of the first thromboembolic event was 14 years (range, 0.1 to 17 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another cohort of 29 children, the mean age at diagnosis was eight years; 10 patients were diagnosed following a venous thromboembolic event (34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of AT replacement in the peripartum setting, two presentations involved individuals first diagnosed when they developed a venous thromboembolic event during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Case reports of earlier presentations may reflect multiple thrombophilic defects. This has been reported in patients with AT deficiency as well as the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. As genes for AT and factor V are both on the long arm of chromosome 1, the defects in families in which both mutant genes are on the same chromosome will always occur together. In a case report, an infant of consanguineous parents presented at 13 months of age with fever and cerebral vein thrombosis; he had homozygosity for a familial <em>SERPINC1</em> mutation (with AT activity of 11 percent) along with heterozygosity for the FVL mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some children may be protected from VTE during childhood due to higher levels of alpha-2-macroglobulin during the first two decades of life; alpha-2-macroglobulin also acts as a thrombin inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Some studies have reported an increased frequency of thromboembolic events after puberty, with a peak between 15 and 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3484972\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, individuals with hereditary AT deficiency have developed fibrin thrombi in the kidneys, leading to renal insufficiency. This creates challenges for managing hemodialysis.

This occurs because heparin is an indirect inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa, and requires adequate levels of circulating AT in order be effective. (See <a href=\"#H811586\" class=\"local\">'AT function'</a> above.)</p><p>Some patients with heparin resistance due to AT deficiency may benefit from AT replacement. This was illustrated in a cohort of nine children with hereditary AT deficiency who were treated with heparin for a thromboembolic event, two required AT replacement therapy for anticoagulation to reach therapeutic levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. AT replacement has also been reported in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810922\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for testing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257542\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with VTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not perform AT testing in the majority of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE).

If a low level is measured inadvertently during an acute illness, this should be repeated when the individual has recovered. Testing also should not be performed while the patient is taking an anticoagulant. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Timing of testing'</a> below.)</p><p>In the event that a patient with an acute VTE treated with heparin appears to have heparin resistance (due to failure of the activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] to prolong despite very high doses of heparin) and a low AT level is measured, it may not be possible to determine whether the low level is due to inherited deficiency or to acquired deficiency (which in turn may be due to thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heparin). In such cases, we would repeat the testing when the individual's medical condition has returned to baseline (eg, several weeks to months later). Administration of AT concentrate (or Fresh Frozen Plasma [FFP] as a source of AT) might be appropriate for severely low AT levels in the range of &lt;30 to 40 percent.

The assay measures the ability of heparin to inhibit a coagulation factor (thrombin [factor IIa] or factor Xa), which requires AT activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832 \">figure 3</a>). We prefer factor Xa inhibition to thrombin inhibition, due to the increased specificity of factor Xa inhibition for AT deficiency. The rationale is that factor Xa is inhibited by AT (heparin cofactor I) alone via a heparin-dependent mechanism, whereas thrombin can also be inhibited by heparin cofactor II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. Heparin cofactor II is an efficient inhibitor of thrombin in the presence of heparin concentrations used in the AT-heparin cofactor assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. As a result, an assay based on thrombin inhibition can be affected by differences in heparin cofactor II activity. The increased specificity of the factor Xa-based assay was illustrated in a study of 67 members of a family with type II AT deficiency (see <a href=\"#H2635206705\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In members with true AT deficiency based on genetic testing, the factor Xa-based assay was more reliable than the thrombin-based assay; six individuals might have been reported incorrectly as negative for the defect when tested with the thrombin-based assay.</p><p>The factor Xa-based assay may be inaccurate in individuals with a specific AT mutation known as AT Cambridge (AT A384S). Factor Xa-based assays cannot be used to diagnose these individuals, and results from thrombin-based assays are only weakly positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The clinical relevance of this mutation remains unclear.</p><p>Most laboratories set the lower limit of normal for AT activity at approximately 80 percent (normal range, approximately 80 to 120 percent); the values are typically calculated as two standard deviations from the mean. Laboratory-specific values should be used to take into account instrument and assay variability. Patients with hereditary AT deficiency due to heterozygosity for a <em>SERPINC1</em> mutation usually have AT activity levels in the range of 40 to 60 percent.</p><p>Assays for AT protein levels (rather than function) such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/1,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,75</a>]. However, these are less useful for initial testing because they do not reflect AT function and will fail to identify individuals with a type II defect (see <a href=\"#H2635206705\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above). In some cases this testing can be done to distinguish between type I and type II defects in an individual with deficient AT activity. If needed, additional testing can be performed in specialized coagulation laboratories. As an example, a few specialized laboratories can perform the progressive AT activity assay, which quantifies the capacity of AT to neutralize the enzymatic activity of thrombin in the absence of heparin. This assay can be used to distinguish functional deficiency produced by defects in the AT thrombin binding site versus the heparin binding site. This additional testing is usually reserved for research purposes and is not widely available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important consideration in the laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected AT deficiency is the timing of testing. Erroneous diagnoses can be made due to the influence of acute thrombosis, comorbid illness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticoagulant therapy on AT activity levels. (See <a href=\"#H1104379682\" class=\"local\">'Acquired deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p>For most patients with an acute thromboembolic event or acute illness, testing should be delayed until the patient recovers and is no longer receiving an anticoagulant. Typically, we wait approximately two weeks or more following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> discontinuation. If AT activity was measured in the setting of an acute thromboembolic event or systemic illness, it should be repeated when the patient is asymptomatic.</p><p>Exceptions may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family members of individuals with AT deficiency for whom rapid diagnosis is important for care (eg, in the setting of emergency surgery or acute thromboembolism).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals receiving heparin therapy for whom a therapeutic aPTT cannot be achieved <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional thrombosis develops, and for whom AT replacement therapy or a change in anticoagulant would be used if AT deficiency was identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals receiving asparaginase for whom AT replacement would be used if AT deficiency was identified.</p><p/><p>For individuals on direct oral or parenteral anticoagulants who require a more rapid evaluation or for whom it is not considered safe to discontinue the drug, testing may be accomplished by using an alternative assay (eg, factor Xa-based assay in a patient receiving a direct thrombin inhibitor, thrombin-based assay in a patient receiving a direct factor Xa inhibitor). (See <a href=\"#H216417\" class=\"local\">'Choice of assay'</a> above.)</p><p>The rationale for avoiding testing during anticoagulation is that anticoagulants in some cases can alter the results of testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heparin can lower AT activity, potentially giving the false impression that a patient has AT deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76966 \">table 1</a>).

AT replacement can be stopped once the patient is stably anticoagulated with an oral anticoagulant and heparin is discontinued.</p><p>For oral anticoagulation, options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). While the choice is individualized depending on a number of factors (severity of thrombosis, adherence, patient preference, potential dietary or drug interactions), we generally prefer warfarin rather than a DOAC for patients with recurrent venous thrombosis in association with hereditary AT deficiency. AT deficiency is the most clinically penetrant of the hereditary thrombophilias, and, although there is considerable variation in its expression, in our experience, some patients with this disorder can have recurrent VTE events despite appropriate anticoagulation with warfarin. Warfarin can be titrated to the high end of the dosing range and the target range can be raised if necessary. Furthermore, if the individual has a recurrent event while receiving warfarin, it is possible to establish whether the individual was taking the anticoagulant and whether the level was in the desired therapeutic range. Establishing medication adherence and proper use is more challenging to do with DOACs. Data on the efficacy of DOACs in individuals with AT deficiency are sparse, but there is no mechanistic reason to think that DOACs would be ineffective in an individual with AT deficiency since the effect of these drugs does not require AT function. Most trials evaluating DOACs did not routinely screen participants for hereditary thrombophilia, so there may have been individuals with AT deficiency enrolled in these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259424\"><span class=\"h2\">VTE prophylaxis (hereditary deficiency)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally do not use prophylactic anticoagulation or prophylactic AT administration in patients with incidentally discovered AT deficiency (ie, without a thrombosis history).</p><p>However, some individuals with hereditary AT deficiency may benefit from anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> AT administration in certain settings, such as pregnancy or surgery.

Hereditary AT deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition with variable penetrance. It is one of the less common inherited thrombophilias. A variety of acquired conditions may lower AT levels, but the clinical significance of this finding is often limited. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary AT deficiency is rare. The estimated prevalence in the general population is thought to be in the range of 0.02 to 0.2 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016 \">table 2</a>). In individuals with venous thromboembolism (VTE) the prevalence is estimated to be approximately 1 to 7 percent. (See <a href=\"#H816643\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age of presentation in hereditary AT deficiency varies widely. Among patients with inherited thrombophilia, hereditary AT deficiency confers a greater risk of thrombosis than other defects. Some individuals never have a thromboembolic event; others may have life-threatening thromboembolism as a child, young adult, or with a first pregnancy. Other individuals may come to medical attention because of renal disease or heparin resistance. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not test for AT deficiency in the majority of patients with VTE. We may test individuals with suspected inherited thrombophilia, thrombosis in childhood, heparin resistance, asparaginase therapy, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. When testing is done, a functional assay for plasma AT activity (also called AT-heparin cofactor assay) is the best first test for AT deficiency. This testing is best performed when the patient has recovered from an acute thromboembolic event and is not receiving an anticoagulant. For such a patient, a plasma AT activity level below the normal range (typically &lt;80 percent) is consistent with AT deficiency. The differential diagnosis includes other inherited and acquired thrombophilias. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation is appropriate for individuals with hereditary AT deficiency who have a VTE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F107766\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107766 \">algorithm 1</a>); prophylactic anticoagulation may be used in certain high-risk setting such as pregnancy or surgery. Products for AT replacement are also available, including an AT concentrate derived from pooled human plasma and a recombinant human AT produced from the milk of transgenic goats. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anticoagulation for VTE in patients with hereditary AT deficiency is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H8145286\" class=\"local\">'VTE treatment (hereditary deficiency)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with hereditary AT deficiency who develop a thromboembolism during pregnancy, therapeutic dose anticoagulation is used with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for the remainder of the pregnancy, as discussed separately (see <a href=\"#H259454\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy: Treatment&quot;</a>). If the woman has a personal history of thrombosis or a compelling family history (eg, multiple family members with thrombosis, family member with unprovoked thrombosis), we suggest administering AT just prior to and at delivery during the time when anticoagulation cannot be administered (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The management of patients with AT deficiency (or suspected deficiency) due to asparaginase chemotherapy is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H10748274\" class=\"local\">'Patients receiving asparaginase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AT replacement has also been used in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, hemodialysis, or heparin resistance. (See <a href=\"#H3486653\" class=\"local\">'ECMO or hemodialysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1636601\" class=\"local\">'Heparin resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary AT deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition, and in most families, siblings or children of an affected individual have approximately a 50 percent chance of inheriting the deficiency. Testing of family members is appropriate if the family history is positive for thromboembolic events, especially if multiple family members have been affected or if thromboembolism occurred at an early age. (See <a href=\"#H3485667\" class=\"local\">'Testing of family members and genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombin-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Khor B, Van Cott EM.
