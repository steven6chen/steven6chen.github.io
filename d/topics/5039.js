The limited data comparing surgical and percutaneous closure of a secundum ASD suggest that the rates of procedural success may be comparable or possibly better with surgery, but that the rate of complications and length of hospital stay may be reduced with the percutaneous approach.</p><p>This topic will review the characteristics of the Amplatzer, Gore HELEX, and CardioSEAL devices. Atrial septal defect closure is indicated largely to treat hemodynamic effects. PFO closure is indicated for platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome; its efficacy for stroke prevention is not established. Indications for and efficacy of percutaneous repair of ASDs and PFOs and associated complications are presented separately.

The Gore HELEX Septal Occluder was approved for percutaneous closure of secundum ASDs in August 2006. Another device, the NMT Medical CardioSEAL Septal Occlusion System, was used off-label for ASD and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure but is FDA-approved for use only for closure of certain complex ventricular septal defects.</p><p>The humanitarian device exemptions for two patent foramen occluder devices, the NMT Medical CardioSEAL STARFlex Septal Occlusion system and the AGA Medical AMPLATZER PFO occluder, were withdrawn in October 2006. These devices were subsequently available in the United States for investigational use only. NMT Medical, Inc ceased operations in 2011.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Amplatzer occlusion device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Amplatzer occlusion device is a prosthesis that consists of two round disks made of nitinol wire mesh that are linked together by a short connecting waist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52160\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52160 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Amplatzer device has several advantages over other devices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be delivered through smaller catheters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is self-centering but can be repositioned easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has round retention disks that extend radially beyond the defect, which results in a much smaller overall size and firmer contact with the atrial septum, thereby enhancing endothelialization and reducing the risk of residual shunting.</p><p/><p>Favorable outcomes have been reported in the majority of patients treated with the Amplatzer device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72126\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72126 \">movie 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In a series of 100 consecutive patients, for example, the Amplatzer device was successfully implanted in 93 with a procedure time ranging from 30 to 180 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The total ASD occlusion rate at three months was 99 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HELEX septal occluder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HELEX septal occluder is a device with a low profile, double disk, non-self centering design. Potential advantages over currently approved devices include its ability to conform to the non-curvilinear surface of the atrial septum, and a built-in method for retrieval after device deployment.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of the HELEX device were evaluated in a nonrandomized, noninferiority study involving 247 patients (median age of 5.5 years) who were treated with either the device or open surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition to usual criteria for closure of a secundum ASD, patients in the device arm were required to have a defect diameter &le;22 mm and adequate septal rims to secure the device, both of which were determined by transesophageal or intracardiac echocardiography.</p><p>At 12 months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for the combined primary end point of device safety, the need for repeat procedures to the target ASD, and documentation of complete occlusion or clinically insignificant leak. The noninferiority of the device compared with surgery persisted even after controlling for baseline differences. The most common adverse outcome in the device group was device embolization requiring catheter retrieval (1.7 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">CardioSEAL device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The NMT Medical CardioSEAL device is FDA-approved for <span class=\"nowrap\">closure/repair</span> of certain complex ventricular septal defects but not for closure of ASDs. The CardioSEAL device consists of two self-expanding umbrellas that are attached to the atrial septum by spring tension after implantation; four metal arms, attached to each other at the central hub and covered by Dacron patches, radiate from the central hub of the device to support each umbrella. Two coil joints or hinges in each arm are designed to relieve stress during cardiac contraction. The umbrella is available in sizes ranging from 17 to 40 mm.</p><p>In an initial report describing use of the CardioSEAL device in 50 patients, device arm fractures were seen in 14 percent and protrusion of one arm through the defect was seen in 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The device was subsequently modified by the addition of a self-centering mechanism comprised of nitinol springs connected between the two umbrellas and a flexible core wire with a pin-pivoting connection.</p><p>The modified device, called the NMT Medical STARFlex device, had a lower rate of arm fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This device was previously available under a humanitarian device exemption for closure of PFO but that exemption was withdrawn in October 2006. The device was subsequently available in the United States for investigational use only. </p><p>The CardioSEAL device was further modified by substituting the conventional polyester fabric for a bioengineered, acellular type I collagen matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This formulation (BioSTAR), which permits full resorption of the non-stainless steel components of the device, has the possible advantages of minimizing the potential for future complications from chronic foreign body reactions and maintaining the possibility for unobstructed trans-septal access to the left heart at a later date. A phase I pilot study of 58 patients demonstrated procedural success in 98 percent, successful closure at six months of 96 percent, and the absence of major safety issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>NMT Medical, Inc ceased operations in 2011. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications associated with transcatheter closure of a secundum ASD include device embolization or malposition, arrhythmias (usually atrial but include sudden death), cardiac perforation, thrombus formation with possible cerebral embolization, and device erosion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCARDITIS PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2007 American Heart Association guidelines on endocarditis prophylaxis concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for six months after device closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-percutaneous-closure-of-a-secundum-atrial-septal-defect/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
