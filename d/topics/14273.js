Because of nicotine dependence and social factors, initiation of smoking during adolescence is closely associated with persistent smoking in adulthood and with the many adverse health effects associated with chronic smoking. The long-term consequences of smoking and the benefits of smoking cessation in adults are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer#H21308016\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Smoking'</a>.)</p><p>While there is good consensus on the importance of preventing smoking initiation, techniques for doing so are not standardized or adequately studied. Nonetheless, some general principles arise, extrapolated from health provider interventions for other risk behaviors or from smoking interventions in adults. </p><p>Preventing smoking initiation in children and adolescents will be reviewed here, focusing on interventions that can be performed in the primary care setting. Management of smoking cessation in adolescents is discussed separately.

In addition to evaluating for smoking and promoting <strong>smoking cessation</strong> among their adolescent patients, pediatric health care providers should systematically aim to prevent <strong>smoking initiation</strong> among all of their patients, as detailed in policy statements from many pediatric health care groups in the United States and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].

Every day in the United States, almost 4000 youths between 12 and 17 years of age take up smoking, and about 1000 become daily smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15124721\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of tobacco smoking among adolescents in the United States gradually declined beginning in the late 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. In 2013, 15.7 percent of high school students reported smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days, as compared with 36.4 percent in 1997 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79503\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79503 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The percentage of young adults (18 to 24 years) who have never smoked increased from 65 percent in 1999-2001 to 76 percent in 2011-2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Combustible tobacco use among adolescents in the United States varies by race and ethnicity, with the highest prevalence among whites, Alaska Natives, and American Indians, the lowest among African Americans, and intermediate levels among Hispanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Smoking is generally more prevalent among groups with lower levels of education and lower socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. </p><p>Instead of or in addition to smoking ordinary cigarettes, many teens use other forms of tobacco or nicotine, including chewing tobacco (dip), snuff, bidis, kreteks, snus, hookahs, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50718 \">table 1</a>). In a national survey of middle and high school students in the United States, 7.2 percent of middle school students and 20.2 percent of high school students reported currently using some form of nicotine product including e-cigarettes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101254 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. About one-half of the youth surveyed used two or more tobacco products. Between 2011 and 2016, there were sharp increases in use of e-cigarettes, which quickly became the most commonly used tobacco product. The trend in e-cigarette use offsets decreases in other tobacco products, resulting in no overall change in tobacco and nicotine product use. Of note, the introduction of e-cigarettes to the United States market did not alter the downward trend in cigarette smoking by youth, while it did increase overall exposure to nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some teens may be misinformed about the dangers of e-cigarettes and other alternative nicotine sources. It is important to screen for all forms of nicotine use because teens may fail to mention other forms of tobacco when asked only about smoking. (See <a href=\"#H5188977\" class=\"local\">'Alternative nicotine sources'</a> below.)</p><p>There is also an increasing trend in marijuana use, which was reported by 21 percent of 12<sup>th</sup> grade students in a 2013 report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although marijuana, like tobacco, exposes the user to adverse effects of smoke contaminants (tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), many young users have the false perception that it is not harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

As an example, in a study of Swiss children 11 to 14 years of age, parental approval significantly influenced children's intention to smoke, but this effect decreased for older adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Misperceptions &ndash; Adolescents tend to overestimate the frequency of smoking among their peers and among adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Conversely, adolescents tend to underestimate their own smoking habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marketing &ndash; Although the direct advertising of tobacco to youth is banned in the United States, indirect marketing efforts and positive images of cigarette use in the media have important effects on teenage smoking behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22,23</a>].

Youth are particularly vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine, compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is a growing literature regarding the impact of nicotine on the developing adolescent brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], which is reviewed in a technical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As an example, among sixth grade students (median age 12 years) who smoked at least once per month at baseline, 53 percent experienced symptoms of nicotine dependence and 40 percent escalated to daily smoking during the next four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Early emergence of dependence symptoms predicted escalation in smoking frequency, and smoking frequency accelerated the appearance of dependence symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Nicotine dependence is an important factor in determining which individuals become regular smokers after smoking experimentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,30,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,30,33,34</a>]. </p><p>The specific symptoms of nicotine dependence are discussed separately.

Health concerns about these alternative nicotine sources are discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use#H279603278\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;, section on 'Other forms of tobacco'</a>.) </p><p>Strategies similar to those described above for smoking prevention can also be used for prevention and cessation of smokeless tobacco use. Providers should emphasize the specific health risks of smokeless tobacco use, as well as the cosmetic consequences of stained teeth and bad teeth (gum disease and tooth loss). Oral health professionals and medical providers have important opportunities for intervention, in addition to educational efforts in the community and school, although few intervention trials have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15124877\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERTISING AND MEDIA INFLUENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, tobacco advertising that targets people younger than 18 years of age has been prohibited since 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Advertising expenditures for cigarettes, which accounted for 90 percent of all tobacco product advertising in 1998, decreased by 85 percent over the following decade, from $365.2 million in 1998 to $53.1 million in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. In 2009, tobacco brand sponsorship of sports and entertainment events was prohibited. Between 1992 and 2013, sports-related marketing expenditures decreased significantly for both cigarettes (from $136 million in 1992 to $0 in 2013) and smokeless tobacco (from $34.8 million in 1992, to $2.1 million in 2013) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. However, adolescents are also exposed to tobacco advertising through point-of-sale advertising, promotional products, the internet and social media, and demonstration of tobacco use in films and on television, and a substantial portion of tobacco company expenditures are focused on marketing efforts that reduce the prices of some tobacco products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,121</a>]. There is good evidence that these marketing activities effectively promote smoking among youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. E-cigarettes are also marketed through multiple methods including the internet and social media, and surveys demonstrate that 69 percent of middle and high school students in the United States are exposed to this advertising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p>Depiction of smoking in movies also has an important influence on the initiation of smoking among youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,123-125\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,123-125</a>]. The film industry participates in a voluntary ban of paid product placement, and depiction of tobacco use in popular youth-rated movies decreased substantially from an average of 20 incidents per movie in 2005 to seven per movie in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Most of the improvements were seen in movies produced by the three companies with specific anti-tobacco policies. </p><p>To counteract these influences, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have been launched, and these appear to be effective in fostering smoking resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,8,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,127</a>]. Studies indicate that a child's exposure to &quot;truth&quot; (anti-smoking) advertisements was associated with positive changes in attitudes, beliefs, and intentions to avoid smoking. In another example, exposure to the &quot;Real Cost&quot; media campaign in the United States was associated with preventing smoking initiation among nearly 350,000 youth during a two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Conversely, exposure to advertisements created by the tobacco industry that purport to discourage smoking among youth (eg, Phillip Morris' &quot;Think. Don't Smoke&quot; campaign) was associated with more favorable beliefs and attitudes toward the tobacco industry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,129</a>]. The findings suggest that well-executed anti-smoking campaigns can positively and consistently change youths' beliefs and attitudes, whereas a tobacco industry-sponsored campaign can have a counterproductive influence. Other strategies include promoting stricter regulations that prohibit tobacco advertising and promotion in forms that are accessible to youth (including sponsorship of celebrities and events by tobacco companies) and restriction of tobacco product placement in movies and media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. </p><p>Social media messaging is being explored as a strategy to prevent adolescent smoking. As an example, for one study youths were shown gender-specific &quot;YouTube-style&quot; videos addressing tobacco exposure as a modifiable risk for cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. The youths reported a positive response to the videos and an interest in sharing them on social networking sites. These observations suggest that social media messages have potential for cost-effective health promotion initiatives targeting youth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15124884\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES TO LIMIT ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoke-free air laws and state tobacco control programs have been shown to be effective strategies for curbing youth smoking in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">131,132</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154386399\"><span class=\"h2\">Age restrictions for sales</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents and providers may be better able to limit youth access to tobacco by understanding how youths are able to purchase these products, then taking measures to prevent this. Despite numerous laws in the United States that restrict access to cigarettes for individuals under 18 years of age, most youths report that they can obtain cigarettes through one or more of the following means:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an older friend purchase cigarettes for them, or by using false identification. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purchasing cigarettes themselves, if the merchant fails to enforce the age limit. Merchant compliance with tobacco purchasing laws is inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purchasing cigarettes over the internet, using credit cards or money orders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. E-cigarettes are readily available through the internet; one survey from 2015 found that two-thirds of internet vendors required only a self-verified statement of age, and 35 percent had no age verification process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. </p><p/><p>Merchant compliance with youth access laws is not sufficient. A comprehensive review reported no association between retailer compliance with youth access laws and smoking susceptibility, past-year initiation, current smoking, or established smoking in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has called for increasing the minimum age for tobacco sales to 21 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Reductions in youth smoking have been observed when the minimum age is increased and similar changes are needed for access to e-cigarettes as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/108,136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,136,137</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154386412\"><span class=\"h2\">Taxes and cost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher costs of cigarettes reduce adolescents' tobacco use because cigarette smoking in this age group is particularly sensitive to price [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,131,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,131,138</a>].

However, because of inflation, the relative burden of cigarette taxes tends to decrease over time. Because smoking among young age groups is sensitive to price, tobacco companies have specifically sought ways to reduce the price of tobacco products as part of their marketing strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The AAP has called for increasing prices on tobacco products to reduce tobacco use initiation among youth.

As a result, sales of cigarettes with &quot;characterizing flavors&quot; (or &quot;candy-flavored&quot; tobacco) were banned in the United States in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. However, this legislation does not include many other types of tobacco products, such as cigars, tobacco-based wraps, smokeless tobacco, or electronic cigarettes, nor does it include menthol flavors. Manufacturers have developed products that circumvent this restriction, including flavored &quot;little cigars,&quot; which closely resemble cigarettes. Flavored versions of &quot;little cigars&quot;, &quot;blunt wraps&quot; (often used to roll cannabis), smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes are marketed with themes, images, and media sources that target youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>] (see <a href=\"#H15124877\" class=\"local\">'Advertising and media influence'</a> above). A number of municipalities in the United States have enacted local legislation to restrict the sale of these flavored nicotine products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and the AAP has called for comprehensive bans on all flavoring agents (including menthol) in all tobacco products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15124898\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About 80 percent of individuals who start smoking during adolescence will continue to smoke in adulthood, and one-third of these individuals will die prematurely due to smoking-related disease. Therefore, the pediatric population is a critical target for public health efforts to reduce smoking. (See <a href=\"#H1580858852\" class=\"local\">'Why prevention is important'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About 20 percent of high school students in the United States smoke cigarettes; the rate has gradually declined since the late 1990s but has now plateaued (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79503\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79503 \">figure 1</a>). Between 2011 and 2014 there have been sharp increases in use of e-cigarettes and hookahs among youth that offset decreases in other tobacco products, resulting in no overall change in tobacco and nicotine product use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101254 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15124721\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and trends'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nicotine dependence can appear within days to weeks of the onset of occasional cigarette use and often before the onset of daily smoking. As a result, experimentation or a light smoking habit can rapidly escalate into daily or heavy smoking, and many adolescent smokers have difficulty quitting although they are often motivated to do so. (See <a href=\"#H15124750\" class=\"local\">'Nicotine dependence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pediatric health care provider should include smoking prevention measures in all primary care visits.
