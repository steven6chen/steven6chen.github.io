Treatment includes patient education and general measures taken by the patient to prevent and treat attacks, and may include pharmacologic interventions and surgical sympathetic blockade to prevent and treat digital ischemia.</p><p>The treatment of RP in patients resistant to initial therapy is reviewed here. The initial therapy of RP, including general measures, the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and behavioral interventions, as well as the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of RP, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3060078\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is considered primary if the symptoms occur alone without any associated disorder; secondary RP refers to the presence of the disorder in association with a related illness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic sclerosis (SSc). Primary RP is sometimes also referred to as idiopathic RP or Raynaud disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with primary RP are generally not significantly disabled by the attacks, although the quality of life may be affected by the need for cold avoidance and by the lack of normal finger sensation. An initially conservative, nonpharmacologic approach is therefore most important for these patients, although pharmacologic therapy may ultimately be necessary. By comparison, patients with secondary RP are more likely to have severe attacks, and disease management is more likely to be based upon pharmacologic agents, while continuing nonpharmacologic measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3060085\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS AND OVERVIEW OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy are to improve quality of life and to prevent ischemic tissue injury. At least a moderate reduction in the intensity of attacks and the prevention of digital ulcers or tissue injury are achievable in most patients. However, abolishing cold sensitivity and eliminating all Raynaud events is not likely with available treatment options, particularly in patients with secondary Raynaud phenomenon (RP), due to the complexity and sensitivity of the regulation of thermoregulatory vessels in the skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of the treatment depends upon the severity of disease and upon the presence or absence of an underlying disorder; this is particularly important in patients with an underlying systemic rheumatic disease related to systemic sclerosis (SSc), as such patients can have a structural component to their vascular disease in addition to the vasospastic component seen in all patients with RP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3061671\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment of patients with the RP is described in detail elsewhere.

Most reported clinical trials are short-term, typically four to six weeks in duration. In our experience, there is sustained benefit from treatment with a CCB. This impression is based upon the consistent occurrence of relapses of severe Raynaud events if a CCB is discontinued. However, there are little objective data to define the duration of benefit of single or combination drug therapy.</p><p>Similarly, careful long-term studies of the outcome following surgical intervention or injection therapy (eg, with botulinum toxin A) are not adequate to provide guidance. Our impression is that the RP recurs following surgical digital sympathectomy, but is usually not as severe as prior to surgery.</p><p>Each patient needs to be evaluated periodically for the need for a particular intervention. It is important to take into account the risk of the intervention, the clinical evidence for its effectiveness, and the need for continued therapy at the time of the evaluation, balancing the risks of therapy and the level of severity of the RP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANT TO INITIAL THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, we assess response to initial therapy by asking patients to consider the impact of the condition on their life, taking into account the frequency of attacks, the duration of attacks, the disability it is causing, and the effect on daily life. Recurrent digital ischemic lesions are also considered as resistance to initial therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon#H27741388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;, section on 'Assessment of the response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients resistant to initial therapies, including general nonpharmacologic measures and maximum tolerated doses of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) known to be effective for the treatment of Raynaud phenomenon (RP), we use the following measures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We review and reinforce the importance of continuing the general nonpharmacologic measures for prevention and treatment.

In patients in whom a PDE inhibitor is not available, effective, or well-tolerated, we suggest the use of topical nitrates. (See <a href=\"#H782103\" class=\"local\">'Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H782864\" class=\"local\">'Topical nitrates'</a> below.)</p><p>Both classes of vasodilators have shown benefit in several randomized trials in patients with primary or secondary RP compared with placebo, but results have been mixed. Combination therapy of a CCB and another vasodilator has not been adequately evaluated in randomized trials, but is increasingly being used in practice in difficult situations such as RP related to systemic sclerosis (SSc) with associated digital ulceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782103\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who have obtained some but inadequate benefit from a CCB and who tolerate that therapy, we suggest the addition of a PDE type 5 inhibitor and continue the CCB. In patients who do not benefit from the CCB, we either add a PDE inhibitor or try the PDE inhibitor as an alternative, depending upon the ability to tolerate the medications, if critical ischemia is not present. (See <a href=\"#H785246\" class=\"local\">'Severe symptoms despite oral and topical agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Based upon the available evidence and our clinical experience, we initiate therapy at a low dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> 20 mg once or twice daily) and increase the dose to 20 mg three times daily if no benefit is achieved. This dose is similar to that used in patients with pulmonary hypertension. A four- to six-week trial should be adequate to determine whether the combination is of benefit.

If clinical signs or symptoms suggest cardiopulmonary disease, an appropriate evaluation is recommended, which would include an echogram (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>). Systemic blood pressure measurements should be followed serially. When possible, we advise patients to obtain a blood pressure (BP) cuff and to monitor their BP daily at first until dosing is stable and then weekly thereafter, as well as when symptoms of hypotension occur.</p><p>A PDE inhibitor should not be used together with topical nitrates due to the increased risk of hypotension. Other adverse effects that may occur include peripheral edema, palpitations, tachycardia, hearing loss, and visual disturbances.</p><p>The increasing use of these medications in efforts to improve peripheral and pulmonary circulation in several disorders is discussed in separately.

There was a modest but significant benefit of PDE inhibitors on Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS), as well as on the frequency and duration of RP attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The RCS represents the level of difficulty experienced by the patient each day that is attributed to RP, and is assessed using a visual analog scale. Although the improvement in the RCS was significant, it was not a clinically meaningful difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon#H27741388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;, section on 'Assessment of the response to therapy'</a>).

Nitrates have been used for the treatment of primary and secondary RP, with different methods of delivery including sustained-release transdermal patches, creams, gels, and ointments.</p><p>We have found the topical nitrates to be more useful for patients with a single or small number of more severely affected digits and for short-term (days to weeks) use, compared with patients with more diffuse involvement and with the need for chronic (months to years) use. However, the efficacy of topical nitrates and duration of benefit are not well-defined, and significant side effects such as headache may occur with most forms of these agents.</p><p>Topical NTG (eg, 0.5 inches [about 1.3 cm] of 2 percent ointment, approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/inch</span> [38 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cm])</span> should be applied to a single more severely affected or ischemic digit for 6 to 12 hours while continuing use of the CCB. The dose of topical NTG may vary depending upon the preparation and should be adjusted with close monitoring of tolerance and the clinical response. The NTG 2 percent ointment can be titrated as needed up to a full 2 inches (about 5.1 cm) every four to six hours with a 12-hour nitrate-free period. However, the higher dose is often not well-tolerated, and patients stop usage. The dose may be divided between several digits, although absorption with most preparations results in systemic effects. Preparations in development that are not available commercially may have reduced systemic absorption and fewer systemic adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p>Potential side effects include headache, flushing, lightheadedness, decreased blood pressure, tachycardia, and aggravation of gastroesophageal reflux.</p><p>In patients with low blood pressure, dehydration, acute or chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or ongoing use of a PDE inhibitor, topical nitrates should generally be avoided; they should be used with great caution and in low dose if essential for treatment for such patients.</p><p>Several small observational studies and randomized trials of different topic nitrates have provided evidence for benefit in patients with RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The efficacy and tolerability of topical nitrates were evaluated in a randomized trial involving 219 patients with primary or secondary RP, in which application of a novel formulation of topical NTG provided benefit without significant adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Topical NTG, MQX-503 (as a 0.5 gram aliquot of 0.9 percent gel), was applied before or within five minutes after the onset of an attack of RP, resulting in a statistically significant greater reduction in the RCS, compared with use of a matching placebo gel (14.3 versus 1.3 percent). This degree of improvement in the RCS is at the level reported to meet a minimally important difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Eight of nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease, or primary RP were clinically improved with active therapy. Only one of five patients with scleroderma reported improvement with prazosin. Patients will typically eventually become refractory to this agent after prolonged usage, in our experience.

However, these studies are generally more than 30 years old, are either individual cases or surveys, and have included patients with various causes of RP or different types of peripheral vascular disease. It is, therefore, difficult to draw any firm conclusion concerning the benefit of sympathectomy in RP. This procedure is associated with significant risks, including temporary or permanent Horner's syndrome, persistent neuralgia, and decreased localized cutaneous sweating. An endoscopic approach may be safer. For example, in one study of 28 patients treated using an endoscopic approach, no major complications occurred, and there were no intra- or perioperative deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>It is also unclear whether benefits that may occur with sympathectomy persist over time.

Only 19 percent claimed lasting benefit, and 66 percent claimed no benefit after one year. However, another series of 25 patients with primary RP and 14 patients with secondary RP demonstrated long-lasting benefits with cervical sympathectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Patients with secondary RP with critical ischemia or active digital ulcers are likely to have some immediate improvement in blood flow following sympathectomy, but the degree and duration of improvement are quite variable.

This procedure should be limited to patients who are failing medical treatment and who continue to have ischemia or severe RP which threatens the involved digit(s).
