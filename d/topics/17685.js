There is also controversy regarding the role of thromboprophylaxis in patients with a history of obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) but no history of prior thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2015877346\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for considering primary thrombosis prevention is based on the increased risk of thrombosis associated with aPL. However, data are limited regarding the actual risk of first thromboembolism associated with aPL in individuals who have not had a thrombosis. Estimates of thrombosis risk in these individuals are based on a limited number of observational studies, most of which include patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are already known to have an increased risk of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H1192579153\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Thromboembolic disease'</a>). A review article suggested that the annual risk of thrombosis among individuals with aPL in the setting of SLE is likely less than 4 percent, and the risk in individuals with aPL without SLE is likely less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients without autoimmune disease</strong> &ndash; One of the few studies to examine the risk of first thrombosis in aPL-positive individuals without a systemic autoimmune disease was a prospective observational study including 178 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients did not receive thromboprophylaxis except in high-risk settings such as surgery, and there were no thromboses during the three-year follow-up period. In another study, the risk of thromboembolism was evaluated in 179 individuals without SLE who had an isolated but persistently positive lupus anticoagulant (LA) and were followed for approximately three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There were seven thromboembolic events (1.3 percent per person-year). All seven individuals had at least one additional major risk factor for thromboembolism, suggesting the contribution of simultaneous risk factors to thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with SLE</strong> &ndash; Several studies have assessed the risk of first thrombosis in individuals with SLE and aPL:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 2248 patients with SLE found that patients with LA had an approximately sixfold increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with those without an LA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. SLE patients with anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) also had an approximately twofold increased risk for VTE compared with patients without aCL. However, the analysis did not account for other risk factors that could also contribute to the increased risk of a thromboembolic event in such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another study, the relationship between VTE and aPL was evaluated in a prospective cohort of 678 individuals with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of LA (measured by the Russell viper venom time assay) and aCL antibodies was assessed quarterly. Multivariate analysis found the presence of LA alone and in combination with an elevated level of aCL to be associated with an increased risk of VTE. However, an elevated aCL level alone was not an independent risk factor for VTE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A subsequent cohort study compared 144 SLE patients with positive aPL but no history of thromboembolism with 144 age- and sex-matched SLE patients with negative aPL and followed them for approximately nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Compared with the aPL-negative patients, aPL-positive patients had higher rates of thrombosis (8 versus 20 percent; hazard ratio [HR] after adjustment for smoking and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use, 3.88, 95% CI 1.82-8.23). The duration of low-dose aspirin therapy was found to have a protective role against thrombosis in aPL-positive patients (HR per month 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), although the hazard ratio barely met statistical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112410175\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there a role for primary prophylaxis?</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3307879366\"><span class=\"h3\">aPL without clinical criteria for APS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not suggest the routine use of an antithrombotic medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or anticoagulant) for primary thrombosis prevention in patients with aPL (with or without SLE) who do not have APS, unless it is appropriate for other reasons such as cardiovascular risk reduction. All of the non-aPL thrombosis risk factors should be addressed and eliminated when possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to patients with aPL without a history of thrombosis is largely based on clinical experience and observational studies. Although retrospective studies suggest that the use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is protective against first thrombosis in aPL-positive patients with or without SLE, the effectiveness of aspirin alone has not been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. In addition, the protective role of aspirin against cardiovascular events and cancer in the general population is highly individualized based on the expected benefit and the risks of bleeding. The general population prevention guidelines (eg, American Heart Association guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) should play a role in the decision to use low-dose aspirin, regardless of whether or not the patient has SLE, particularly since no lupus-specific cardiovascular disease prediction tool exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>A few of the larger studies that have evaluated the role of primary prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or aspirin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> among individuals who are aPL-positive have shown that any benefit, if present, is likely to be small:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2014 meta-analysis that evaluated the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in 1208 individuals with aPL (some had SLE and some did not) found a protective effect with low-dose aspirin (odds ratio [OR] for first venous or arterial thrombosis, 0.50; 95% CI 0.27-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, all but one of the 11 studies included were observational, and there was significant heterogeneity in the studies. In addition, one of the subgroup analyses demonstrated that low-dose aspirin was only protective against arterial thrombosis, and another subgroup analysis found that the protective effect of aspirin was only statistically significant in retrospective (but not prospective) studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A follow-up meta-analysis of observational studies involving 497 SLE and non-SLE patients with an isolated positive aPL without a history of thromboembolism found a reduced risk of thromboembolism among patients who were treated with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> compared with those not treated with aspirin (adjusted HR, 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A subgroup analysis showed a protective effect of aspirin against arterial thrombosis (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.93) but not venous thrombosis (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22-1.11). However, several important studies were excluded from this meta-analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 2007 Antiphospholipid Antibody Acetylsalicylic Acid (APLASA) study is the only double-blind randomized clinical trial to evaluate the role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> prophylaxis in aPL-positive patients; this trial did not find a protective effect of aspirin, but the numbers were small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this trial, 98 individuals with persistent aPL positivity but no history of thromboembolic disease or pregnancy morbidity were randomized to receive aspirin (81 mg daily) or placebo for a mean of 2.3 years. Approximately two-thirds of these individuals had SLE. Three patients in the aspirin-treated group developed thrombosis (two venous and one arterial), compared with none in the placebo group (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.69-1.56).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential role of adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in individuals with SLE and aPL was evaluated in a 2014 trial that randomly assigned 166 aPL-positive patients with SLE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstetric morbidity to receive either low-dose aspirin or low-dose aspirin plus low-intensity warfarin (target international normalized ratio [INR] 1.5; range, 1.3 to 1.7) for approximately three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Approximately three-fourths of the patients had SLE, and one-fourth had obstetric morbidity. There were four thromboembolic events in each group (5 percent; 1.8 percent per person-year), demonstrating that addition of low-intensity warfarin to aspirin did not confer significant thrombotic risk reduction. However, this study did not address the benefit of standard-dose warfarin alone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4052096960\"><span class=\"h3\">APS based on pregnancy morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on limited data, we do not recommend the use of any medication to prevent first thrombosis in patients diagnosed with APS based on a prior pregnancy morbidity, unless it is recommended for other reasons such as cardiovascular risk reduction.

Typically, this involves heparin overlapped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> followed by indefinite warfarin therapy in most patients. The rationale for indefinite therapy is the high rate of recurrent thrombosis, although the number of risk-stratified studies is limited.

Warfarin is not used during pregnancy due to risks of teratogenicity; thus, any individual with APS who becomes pregnant is treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) rather than warfarin, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some aspects of management vary depending on whether the thrombotic event is venous or arterial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The therapy for thromboembolic manifestations of APS is the same regardless of whether the disorder is classified as primary APS or whether it occurs in the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or another systemic autoimmune disease. In cases of severe, widespread thromboembolic complications (catastrophic APS [CAPS]), additional considerations may apply.

However, stopping anticoagulation in selected APS patients with a clearly provoked thrombosis, especially in the setting of low-titer aPL, can be considered after discussing the risks and benefits with the patient. Of note, in patients with persistent LA test performed off anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moderate- to high-titer <span class=\"nowrap\">aCL/anti-beta2-glycoprotein</span> (GP)-I, aPL usually do not disappear during long-term follow-up.

However, there is also evidence suggesting that the actual risk of recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS who have received an initial course of anticoagulation may not be as high as previously thought. A systematic review to assess recurrence risk after a first VTE (with 3114 patients from six randomized trials and two cohort studies) found a trend towards an increased risk for VTE recurrence after stopping anticoagulation that did not meet statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

However, in both series, none of the patients presented with an arterial thrombosis, and most of the patients had an additional reversible risk factor for VTE.

Two-thirds had no recurrent clotting or emboli. Approximately 20 percent had recurrent APS-related events, but none had another episode of multiorgan failure. Among the recurrent thromboembolic events, 40 percent occurred in a perioperative period. This reinforces the importance of attention to minimizing the period without anticoagulation in these individuals.

We do not suggest routine use of any antithrombotic medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or anticoagulant) in these individuals (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, antithrombotic medications should be used if indicated for other reasons, such as aspirin for cardiovascular risk reduction. The role of thromboprophylaxis in women during pregnancy and the peripartum period who are diagnosed with APS based on a prior pregnancy morbidity is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H2178609095\" class=\"local\">'Primary thrombosis prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstay of treatment for acute thromboembolism in a patient with APS is anticoagulation. Typically this involves heparin overlapped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. For individuals with APS who are being treated with an oral anticoagulant, we suggest warfarin rather than a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based on a lack of high-quality evidence that DOACs are as effective as warfarin in APS. For individuals who are pregnant or become pregnant, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is used instead of warfarin. (See <a href=\"#H3065976625\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute thrombosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2389144700\" class=\"local\">'Direct oral anticoagulants'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary thrombosis prevention with long-term anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for APS patients due to the high rate of recurrent thrombosis. Our therapeutic strategy differs based on whether the thrombosis is venous or arterial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For individuals with venous thromboembolism (VTE), we use an anticoagulant alone (without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>). We recommend a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3), rather than a higher INR range (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This is based on evidence from randomized trials showing no increased efficacy of the higher target INR and a possible increase in bleeding risk. (See <a href=\"#H4031584079\" class=\"local\">'Venous thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For arterial thromboembolism, data on the optimal therapeutic approach to prevent recurrent thromboembolism are extremely limited, and the optimal approach is less clear. For most patients with APS and arterial thromboembolism, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (INR range, 2 to 3) plus low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Risk-benefit assessment is important in arterial thromboembolism as some individuals may reasonably choose to use another approach (eg, low-dose aspirin alone in selected older adults with stroke and low aPL titers). (See <a href=\"#H235594135\" class=\"local\">'Arterial thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Regardless of the anticoagulation strategy, reduction of reversible risk factors is important. (See <a href=\"#H661741543\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of reversible risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely for most individuals with APS and a history of an unprovoked thrombotic event. This is based on the high likelihood of recurrence in the untreated patient and the potentially devastating nature of recurrent thromboembolic events, especially arterial events. (See <a href=\"#H3493198143\" class=\"local\">'Can anticoagulation be stopped?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals with APS have a baseline prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), making monitoring of heparin therapy difficult. Less commonly, the baseline prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged. Our approaches to monitoring anticoagulation in these individuals are described above. (See <a href=\"#H1108317752\" class=\"local\">'Additional considerations with anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent thromboembolism in an individual with APS who is being treated with an anticoagulant is rare, and often there are unique circumstances that must be considered. The approach is individualized according to patient circumstances and may include a higher target INR, switching to LMWH, or adding other medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, an immunomodulatory agent). (See <a href=\"#H2971619444\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent thromboembolism despite adequate anticoagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3937770118\" class=\"local\">'Immunomodulatory agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of noncriteria manifestations of APS (clinical manifestations that are not part of the revised Sapporo classification criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F104569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104569 \">table 1</a>) such as cardiac valve disease, central nervous system involvement, renal disease, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia) is challenging due to the diversity of features and lack of data. Individuals with cardiac valve vegetations may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or anticoagulation if not already receiving it; those with white matter lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be treated with aspirin in some cases, and thrombocytopenia is managed as appropriate based on the suspected underlying cause.
