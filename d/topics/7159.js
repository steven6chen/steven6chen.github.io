Fever occurs when the body's temperature is elevated as a result of the body's thermostat being reset to a higher-than-usual temperature.</p><p>Nearly every child will develop a fever at some point. The challenge for parents is to know when to be concerned. This topic review will discuss the definition of a fever, how to accurately measure a child's temperature, how and when to treat fever, and signs and symptoms that require further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FEVER DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the normal variation in body temperature, there is no single value that is defined as fever. In general, a fever means a temperature above 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C). You might get slightly different numbers depending on how you take your child's temperature &ndash; oral (mouth), axillary (armpit), ear, forehead, or rectal.</p><p>Axillary, ear, and forehead temperature measurements are easier to obtain than rectal or oral temperatures, but they are less accurate and may need to be confirmed rectally or orally in certain children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FEVER CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is the most common cause of fever in children. Common viral and bacterial illnesses like colds, gastroenteritis, ear infections, croup, bronchiolitis, and urinary tract infections are the most likely illnesses to cause fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Croup in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is little or no scientific evidence to support the widespread belief that teething causes fever. Although it is difficult to disprove this notion completely, alternative causes of fever should always be sought and temperatures above 102&deg;F (38.9&deg;C) should never be attributed to teething.</p><p>Bundling a child who is less than three months old in too many clothes or blankets can increase the child's temperature slightly. However, a rectal temperature of 101&deg;F (38.5&deg;C) or greater is not likely to be related to bundling and should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation recommended'</a> below.)</p><p>Some childhood immunizations can cause fever. The timing of the fever varies, depending upon which vaccination was given. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DO I MEASURE MY CHILD'S TEMPERATURE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to measure a child's temperature depends upon several factors. In all children, a rectal temperature is the most accurate. However, it is possible to accurately measure the temperature in the mouth (for children older than four or five years) when the proper technique is used.</p><p>Temperatures measured in the armpit are less accurate but may be useful as a first test in an infant who is younger than three months or an older child who cannot hold the thermometer under his or her tongue. If the armpit temperature is over 99&deg;F (37.2&deg;C), the rectal temperature should be measured. Temperatures measured in the ear or on the forehead also are less accurate than temperatures measured rectally or orally and may need to be confirmed by one of these methods.</p><p>It is not accurate to measure a child's temperature by feeling the child's skin. This is called a tactile temperature, and it is highly dependent upon the temperature of the person who is feeling the child's skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Glass versus digital thermometers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digital thermometers are inexpensive, widely available, and the most accurate way to measure temperature. A variety of styles are available.</p><p>Glass thermometers that contain mercury are not recommended due to the potential risks of exposure to mercury (which is toxic) if the thermometer is broken. If a digital thermometer is not available, be sure to carefully &quot;shake down&quot; the glass thermometer before use. Instructions for disposing of thermometers that contain mercury are available online (<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/mercury/spills/index.htm&amp;token=dTBOilJYMbf5xmv0T7a65dscTP83wWUnglEoypjK+aNTjy0Z1HFL1bsJyjJtPgY2k0yano2AIfl8ppR9lmQtaA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1177\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.epa.gov/mercury/spills/index.htm</a>).</p><p>Other types of thermometers are available, including plastic strip and pacifier thermometers. However, these are not as accurate as digital thermometers and are not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rectal temperature</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child or infant should lie down on his or her stomach across an adult's lap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly (eg, Vaseline) to the end of the thermometer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently insert the thermometer into the child's anus until the silver tip of the thermometer is not visible <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/4</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> inch inside the anus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74460 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the thermometer in place. A glass thermometer requires two minutes, while most digital thermometers need less than one minute.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Do not measure the temperature in a child's mouth if he or she has consumed a hot or cold food or drink in the last 30 minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean the thermometer with cool water and soap. Rinse with water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the tip of the thermometer under the child's tongue toward the back. Ask the child to hold the thermometer with his or her lips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the lips sealed around the thermometer. A glass thermometer requires approximately three minutes, while most digital thermometers need less than one minute.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Armpit temperature</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the tip of the thermometer in the child's dry armpit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the thermometer in place by holding the child's elbow against the chest for four to five minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ear thermometers are not as accurate as rectal or oral thermometers. If the child has been outside on a cold day, wait 15 minutes before measuring the ear temperature. Ear tubes and ear infections do not affect the accuracy of an ear temperature.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To measure temperature accurately in the ear, the parent must pull the child's outer ear backward before inserting the thermometer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61085\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61085 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the ear probe in the child's ear for approximately two seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H984497152\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal artery temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temperature of the temporal artery can be taken by a device that is run over the forehead and in front of the ear (contact) or one that takes the temperature without touching your child using an infrared sensor (noncontact). These devices are not as accurate as a rectal or oral temperature but may be used to screen for fever in children older than four years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOULD I TREAT MY CHILD'S FEVER?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are pros and cons of treating fever. Fever may play a role in fighting infection, but it can also make a child uncomfortable.</p><p>The height of a child's fever is not always the best indicator of whether the child needs to be treated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evaluated. Instead, it is important to note how a child behaves and appears. Fever is usually accompanied by other symptoms. Some of these symptoms require evaluation by a health care provider, even if there is no fever. The table provides a list of some of these symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52493 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In most cases, a child with a fever can be observed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated at home. However, it is important for parents to know when a child with a fever needs to be evaluated by a health care provider, when fever should be treated, and when it is reasonable to observe the child without treating the fever.</p><p>The guidelines provided below are general guidelines that do not apply to every situation; parents who have questions or are concerned about their child should contact their child's health care provider for advice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation recommended</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A health care provider should be consulted in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants who are less than three months of age who have a rectal temperature of 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or greater, regardless of how the infant appears (eg, even well-appearing young infants should be evaluated). These patients should not receive fever medication (eg, acetaminophen) until they have consulted with their health care provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are three months to three years who have a rectal temperature of 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or greater for more than three days or who appear ill (eg, fussy, clingy, refusing to drink fluids).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are 3 to 36 months who have a rectal temperature of 102&deg;F (38.9&deg;C) or greater.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children of any age whose oral, rectal, tympanic membrane, or forehead temperature is 104&deg;F (40&deg;C) or greater or whose axillary temperature is 103&deg;F (39.4&deg;C) or greater.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children of any age who have a febrile seizure. Febrile seizures are convulsions that occur when a child (between six months and six years of age) has a temperature greater than 100.4&deg; F (38&deg;C). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febrile-seizures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Febrile seizures (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children of any age who have recurrent fevers for more than seven days, even if the fevers last only a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children of any age who have a fever and have a chronic medical problem such as heart disease, cancer, lupus, or sickle cell anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who have a fever as well as a new skin rash.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment recommended</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of fever is recommended if a child has an underlying medical problem, including diseases of the heart, lung, brain, or nervous system. In children who have had febrile seizures in the past, treatment of fever has not been shown to prevent seizures but is still a reasonable precaution.</p><p>Treatment of fever may be helpful if the child is uncomfortable, although it is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment not required</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, it is not necessary to treat a child's fever. A child older than three months who has a rectal temperature less than 102&deg;F (38.9&deg;C) and who is otherwise healthy and acting normally does not require treatment for fever.</p><p>Parents who are unsure if their child's fever needs treatment should contact the child's health care provider. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation recommended'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FEVER TREATMENT OPTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective way to treat fever is to use a medication such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). These treatments can reduce the child's discomfort and lower the child's temperature by 2 to 3&deg;F (1 to 1.5&deg;C). Aspirin is not recommended for children under age 18 years due to concerns that it can cause a rare but serious illness known as Reye syndrome.</p><p>Acetaminophen may be given every four to six hours as needed but should not be given more than five times in a 24-hour period. Acetaminophen should not be used in children younger than three months of age without consultation with a health care provider. The dose of acetaminophen should be calculated based upon the child's weight (not age).</p><p>Ibuprofen may be given every six hours. Ibuprofen should not be used in children younger than six months of age. The dose of ibuprofen should be calculated based upon the child's weight (not age).</p><p>Giving combinations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen or alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen increases the chance of giving the wrong dose of one or the other of the medications.</p><p>Fever-reducing medications should only be given as needed and discontinued once bothersome symptoms have resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6659985\"><span class=\"h2\">Increase fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having fever can increase a child's risk of becoming dehydrated. To reduce this risk, parents should encourage their child to drink an adequate amount of fluids. Children with fever may not feel hungry, and it is not necessary to force them to eat. However, fluids such as milk (cow's or breast), formula, and water should be offered frequently. Older children may eat flavored gelatin, soup, or frozen popsicles. If the child is unwilling or unable to drink fluids for more than a few hours, the parent should consult the child's health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6659992\"><span class=\"h2\">Rest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having a fever causes most children to feel tired and achy. During this time, parents should encourage their child to rest as much as the child wants. It is not necessary to force the child to sleep or rest if he or she begins to feel better. Children may return to school or other activities when the temperature has been normal for 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Sponging and baths</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sponging is not as effective as medications for fever and generally is not recommended. Alcohol should not be used for sponging because of the risk of toxicity if it is absorbed through the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=1177\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
