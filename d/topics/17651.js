The clinical syndrome is characterized by the development of dyspnea, generally associated with rapid accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial and alveolar spaces, which is the result of acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures (cardiogenic pulmonary edema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ADHF can also present as elevated left ventricular filling pressures and dyspnea without pulmonary edema.</p><p>ADHF is most commonly due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, with or without additional cardiac pathology, such as coronary artery disease or valve abnormalities. However, a variety of conditions or events can cause cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the absence of heart disease, including primary fluid overload (eg, due to blood transfusion), severe hypertension (particularly renovascular hypertension), and severe renal disease.</p><p>In the large majority of patients who present with ADHF, acute or subacute decompensation is in the context of chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (also known as systolic HF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (also known as diastolic HF) and in many cases, there is a prior history of episodes of decompensation. In such patients, information regarding the precipitating factors, workup for HF, and the elements of successful therapy for prior episodes (eg, types and doses of diuretics used) can be of great value in approaching the current episode. </p><p>The components of therapy of ADHF in patients without acute myocardial infarction (MI) will be reviewed here. A table to assist with emergency management of ADHF is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75041 \">table 1</a>). General considerations for treatment of ADHF and the pathophysiology and evaluation of patients with ADHF are presented separately.

A table to assist with emergency management of ADHF is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75041 \">table 1</a>). The initial approach is similar in patients with ADHF whether caused by systolic or diastolic dysfunction.

It is important to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. The mainstay of therapy in the acute setting is diuretic for volume overload. </p><p>Early intravenous vasodilator therapy is suggested in selected patients with ADHF who require a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular afterload (eg, those with severe hypertension, acute mitral regurgitation, or acute aortic regurgitation). The aggressiveness of diuretic and vasodilator therapy depends on the patient's hemodynamic and volume status. Patients with flash pulmonary edema due to hypertension, for instance, require aggressive vasodilatory therapy. Patients with normotension and volume overload may be treated with diuretic therapy with or without vasodilator therapy. </p><p>Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is indicated in patients hospitalized with acute HF. Sodium restriction is suggested in all patients with HF. </p><p>Vasopressin receptor antagonists are a rarely required option for patients with volume overload with severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium &le;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> despite fluid restriction. We suggest generally avoiding opiate therapy in patients with ADHF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation should be provided as needed to treat hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90 percent). Oxygen is not recommended as routine therapy in patients without hypoxemia, as it may cause vasoconstriction and reduction in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, we suggest initial therapies in the following order: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-rebreather facemask delivering high-flow percent oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If respiratory distress, respiratory acidosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxia persist on oxygen therapy, we recommend a trial of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) if emergent intubation is not indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68216\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68216 \">algorithm 1</a>), no contraindications to NIV exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442 \">table 2</a>), and personnel with experience in NIV are available. </p><p/><p>This approach is supported by evidence from meta-analyses and randomized trials in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, indicating that NIV decreases the need for intubation and improves respiratory parameters, such as dyspnea, hypercapnia, acidosis, and heart rate. NIV may be particularly beneficial in patients with hypercapnia. These issues and conflicting data on a possible impact on mortality are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiogenic pulmonary edema'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with respiratory failure who fail to improve with NIV (within one-half to two hours) or do not tolerate or have contraindications to NIV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442 \">table 2</a>) should be intubated for conventional mechanical ventilation. In such patients, positive end-expiratory pressure is often useful to improve oxygenation.

As noted in the 2013 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> HF guidelines, patients admitted with significant fluid overload should receive diuretic therapy without delay in the emergency department or outpatient clinic, as early intervention may produce better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The expeditious initiation of an effective diuretic regimen is important in controlling dyspnea and other symptoms related to fluid overload, and in addition, may improve in-hospital outcomes. A multicenter, prospective observational study of 1291 patients with ADHF treated within 24 hours of their arrival in an emergency department found that early treatment (&lt;60 minutes) was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality than later treatment (2.3 versus 6.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Early treatment remained significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.20-0.76). As time to diuresis was delayed, the risk of mortality increased steeply during the first 100 minutes and then leveled off.</p><p>Rare exceptions in which some delay in diuresis may be required include patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock. In such cases, the underlying cause for hemodynamic instability should be sought, and the patient may require hemodynamic and mechanical ventilatory support along with diuresis. Patients with aortic stenosis with volume overload should be diuresed with caution.</p><p>Patients with ADHF are usually volume overloaded. Even in the less common situation in which cardiogenic pulmonary edema develops without significant volume overload (eg, with hypertensive emergency, acute aortic or mitral valvular insufficiency), fluid removal with intravenous diuretics can relieve symptoms and improve oxygenation. Intravenous rather than oral administration is recommended because of greater and more consistent drug bioavailability.</p><p>Limited clinical trial data have shown a mortality benefit from diuretic therapy in patients with chronic HF (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H31397796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Efficacy and safety'</a>). Although the safety and efficacy of diuretics to treat ADHF have not been established in randomized trials, extensive observational experience has demonstrated that they effectively relieve congestive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Diuretic administration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454250536\"><span class=\"h4\">Individualized dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretic dosing should be individualized and titrated according to patient status and response. The approach to initial diuretic therapy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload varies according to whether or not the patient has received prior loop diuretic therapy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have not previously received loop diuretic therapy, the following are common initial intravenous doses of loop diuretics in patients with normal renal function:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Furosemide</a> &ndash; 20 to 40 mg intravenously</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bumetanide</a> &ndash; 1 mg intravenously</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Torsemide</a> &ndash; 10 to 20 mg intravenously</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is little or no response to the initial dose, the dose should be doubled at two-hour intervals as needed up to the maximum recommended doses. While patients with a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (typically estimated from the serum creatinine concentration, although this method can be used only if kidney function is stable) can usually be diuresed with intravenous doses of 40 to 80 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, 20 to 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, or 1 to 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, patients with renal insufficiency or severe HF may require higher maximum bolus doses of up to 160 to 200 mg of furosemide, 100 to 200 mg of torsemide, or 4 to 8 mg of bumetanide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic principles of diuretic dosing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Maximum effective dose of loop diuretics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients treated with loop diuretics chronically may need a higher dose in the acute setting; the initial intravenous dose should be equal to or greater than (eg, 2.5 times) their maintenance total daily oral dose and then adjusted depending upon the response (eg, an initial intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> dose of 40 to 100 mg for a patient who had been taking 40 mg orally per day). In the DOSE trial of intravenous furosemide in patients with ADHF, there was an almost significant trend toward greater improvement in patients&rsquo; global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose (2.5 times the patients&rsquo; prior total daily diuretic dose) group compared with the low-dose (equal to the prior total daily dose) group, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subsequent dose escalation and maximum doses are similar to those used in patients who are not already being treated with loop diuretics.</p><p/><p>Bolus diuretic administration two or more times per day may be necessary. A continuous intravenous infusion is an alternative to intravenous bolus therapy, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Use of a continuous intravenous infusion requires that the patient be responsive to intravenous bolus therapy, which results in higher initial plasma concentrations and therefore higher initial rates of urinary diuretic excretion than a continuous infusion. A continuous infusion should <strong>not</strong> be tried in patients who have not shown response to a maximum intravenous bolus dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H19940053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Regimen'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>As an example, an initial intravenous bolus of 20 to 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> administered over one to two minutes may be followed by a continuous infusion of approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/h</span> in patients with relative intact renal function (estimated glomerular filtration [GFR] rate greater than 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and rates of up to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/h</span> in patients with an estimated GFR less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Adding a thiazide diuretic may potentiate the effect, but hypokalemia should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The onset of diuresis typically occurs within 30 minutes with peak diuresis usually at one to two hours after intravenous diuretic administration. </p><p>We suggest switching from an effective intravenous dose to an oral regimen once the patient&rsquo;s acute symptoms have been stabilized to help ensure that an effective outpatient dose is identified and prescribed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454250542\"><span class=\"h4\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single intravenous dosing regimen (bolus versus continuous infusion; high versus lower dose) has been shown to be superior to others, as discussed separately.

Monitoring should also include watching for and guarding against side effects (including electrolyte abnormalities, symptomatic hypotension, worsening renal function and metabolic alkalosis). Diuretic therapy can also precipitate attacks of gout. The later transition from intravenous to oral diuretics should be made with careful attention to HF status, supine and upright hypotension, renal function, and electrolytes.

Severe muscle cramps may occur with overly rapid diuresis and should be treated with potassium and magnesium repletion if indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Hemodynamic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful monitoring during diuresis is required to prevent adverse hemodynamic effects. By reducing intravascular volume, diuresis will eventually lower central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> and possibly other loop diuretics also have an initial morphine-like effect in acute pulmonary edema, causing venodilation that can decrease pulmonary congestion prior to the onset of diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This effect appears to be mediated by enhanced release of prostaglandins.

Improved forward stroke volume is related to decreases in functional tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and reduction in right ventricular volume with relief of interdependent left ventricular compression and improved left ventricular distensibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Patients with HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction or restrictive physiology may be more sensitive to diuresis-induced reductions in preload. Diuretics may enhance the hypotensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy even when volume overload persists. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Renal function</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H644617389\"><span class=\"h5\">Patterns of change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine often rise during diuretic treatment of ADHF and careful monitoring is recommended. In the absence of other causes for an elevated BUN, a disproportionate rise in BUN relative to serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">(BUN/serum</span> creatinine ratio &gt;20:1) suggests a prerenal state with increased passive reabsorption of urea. An initial rise in BUN may be accompanied by a stable serum creatinine, reflecting preserved GFR. Further elevations in BUN along with a rise in serum creatinine are likely if diuresis is continued in such patients.

Patients in whom this occurs before euvolemic status is achieved have a worse prognosis. Nevertheless, fluid removal may still be required to treat signs and symptoms of congestion, particularly pulmonary edema. On the other hand, a stable serum creatinine suggests that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that the diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous.
