Multiple prospective open-label studies, cases series, and retrospective studies suggest that benzodiazepines alone, ECT alone, or benzodiazepines followed by ECT, lead to recovery in approximately 60 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,15,26,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,26,36-39</a>]. Treatment guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association, United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry recommend treating catatonia with either a benzodiazepine or ECT, depending upon the clinical urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>].</p><p>Multiple reviews of open-label studies, case series, and case reports have found that treatment of catatonia is the same regardless of the underlying disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,39,40</a>]. </p><p>In children and adolescents, the approach to treatment is the same. In a prospective observational study of youth (n = 66, ages 9 to 19 years) who were hospitalized for catatonia, 51 patients received benzodiazepines, which were effective in 65 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The benzodiazepine used most often was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (mean dose 5 mg per day); the large majority received concomitant medications such as antipsychotics. A course of bilateral ECT was administered as first-line treatment in three patients, including two with malignant catatonia, and as second-line treatment in eight other patients. </p><p>Studies suggest that catatonia may respond to the combination of benzodiazepines plus ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although this is not our standard practice, when the combination is employed, an agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> is administered prior to ECT in order to reverse the anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines.

We recommend that clinicians concurrently start a benzodiazepine and the process of obtaining informed consent and medical consultation for ECT. If the patient does not measurably respond to a benzodiazepine within the first day or two, ECT should commence and the benzodiazepine should be discontinued. Reviews of case reports have found that mortality for progressive malignant catatonia increases if ECT does not begin within five days of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,42</a>]. Another review of case reports found that in patients with malignant catatonia, response to ECT occurred in 9 of 11 patients (89 percent), whereas response to a benzodiazepine occurred in 2 of 5 patients (40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>For malignant catatonia that does not respond fully to initial treatment with ECT, we suggest continuing ECT until full remission is achieved. If improvement does not occur or plateaus at partial remission, we recommend continuing ECT and restarting the same benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) that was used while preparations were made to initiate ECT. If there is no further incremental improvement after additional ECT (eg, three more treatments), clinicians should evaluate the quality of the ECT (eg, electrode placement and stimulus) and re-evaluate the patient to determine whether the diagnosis is malignant catatonia. If ECT has been administered properly and the diagnosis of malignant catatonia is confirmed, we suggest that treatment focus upon the underlying disorder (see <a href=\"#H13927951\" class=\"local\">'Underlying disorder'</a> above). As an example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catatonia may be due to the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which occurred in the context of administering a depot neuroleptic.

In addition, if the underlying cause of catatonia is a bipolar or depressive disorder, or for patients requiring a rapid treatment response, ECT is the most effective treatment option. Evidence supporting the use of ECT includes a small, three-week trial that enrolled inpatients (n = 14) with nonaffective catatonia who did not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> within five days; patients were randomly assigned to real ECT (bilateral) plus pill placebo or to sham ECT plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> (4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Improvement of catatonia was greater with real ECT than risperidone.</p><p>Based upon open-label studies, case series, and retrospective studies, it is estimated that approximately 60 percent or more of catatonic patients achieve remission with ECT, including patients unresponsive to a benzodiazepine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,29,36,37,43,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29,36,37,43,58-60</a>]. As an example, a review of case reports of 55 catatonic episodes that were treated with ECT alone found that 85 percent remitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A subsequent chart review of 27 catatonic patients treated with ECT found that 59 percent improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For patients with a bipolar or depressive disorder or acute psychosis, ECT can relieve both the catatonic syndrome and the underlying psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6714269\" class=\"local\">'Electroconvulsive therapy safety and administration'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no established predictors of response to ECT for patients with catatonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, acutely catatonic patients with an underlying bipolar or depressive disorder may respond more favorably to ECT than schizophrenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and ECT does not appear to benefit chronic catatonia in schizophrenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>For retarded or excited catatonia that does not respond fully to initial treatment with a benzodiazepine and subsequent treatment with ECT, we suggest continuing ECT and restarting the same benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) that was used initially. If there is no further incremental improvement after additional ECT (eg, three more treatments), clinicians should evaluate the quality of the ECT (eg, electrode placement and stimulus) and re-evaluate the patient to determine whether the diagnosis is retarded or excited catatonia. If ECT has been administered properly and the diagnosis of catatonia is confirmed, we suggest that treatment focus upon the underlying disorder (see <a href=\"#H13927951\" class=\"local\">'Underlying disorder'</a> above). In addition, it is reasonable to use other treatments that are described below. (See <a href=\"#H4932579\" class=\"local\">'Other treatments'</a> below.) &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714262\"><span class=\"h2\">Benzodiazepine safety and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines are generally safe and well tolerated in this setting. At doses used for treating catatonia, benzodiazepines are not associated with respiratory depression in otherwise healthy adults. However, clinicians should be cognizant of concomitant drugs (eg, opioids) that can cause sedation or respiratory depression. In addition, benzodiazepines cause varying degrees of motor incoordination and increase the risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Benzodiazepines can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> is available in all three formulations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,36</a>]. Intravenous administration is preferred to assure adherence and rapid, complete absorption (intravenous access also permits administration of fluids for dehydration). Intravenous benzodiazepines should be injected or infused slowly. As patients improve, they should be switched to oral medication. &#160;</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> has been studied most often, and is typically initiated at 1 to 2 mg three times per day. For patients who are already receiving lorazepam for another indication when they present with catatonia, the starting dose of lorazepam for catatonia (eg, 1 mg three times per day) is added to the existing dose of lorazepam (eg, 1 mg each night for insomnia). Close observation for a clinical response can substantiate the diagnosis of catatonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4567794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catatonia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Lorazepam challenge'</a>.)</p><p>Subsequently, the dose is increased by 3 mg per day every one to two days, depending upon patient response, tolerability, and clinical urgency. A dose of 6 to 21 mg daily is effective for most patients, but a dose of 30 mg per day is occasionally necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For patients with excited catatonia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 1 to 2 mg is given at more frequent intervals until the patient is calm but awake.&nbsp;</p><p>A more cautious approach is suggested for patients at risk of cardiorespiratory compromise or oversedation, including patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular or respiratory disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume depletion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescriptions for opioid analgesics</p><p/><p>For patients with these risk factors, the initial dose may be reduced to 0.5 mg three times per day and closer monitoring provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,43</a>]. </p><p>The duration of treatment required to achieve remission of catatonia with a benzodiazepine is typically 4 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The benzodiazepine is usually continued at the effective dose for three to six months to maintain recovery and is then slowly tapered and discontinued, although longer maintenance treatment may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p>Drug information topics are available for specific benzodiazepines. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714269\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroconvulsive therapy safety and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECT is generally safe, even in patients whose general medical status is compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], as well as patients who are pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] or elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, the success of ECT depends upon an appropriate pre-ECT evaluation, the goals of which are to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize the risk of cognitive and other side effects associated with ECT. ECT is typically administered with the same technique used for other indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-electroconvulsive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for electroconvulsive therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technique for performing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>There are no absolute contraindications to ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>]. Underlying general medical conditions may increase the risk of adverse effects of ECT or general anesthesia, but modern ECT technique and preprocedure consultation to optimize the patient&rsquo;s general medical status reduce these risks. As an example, catatonic patients with motor immobility and muscle damage are at increased risk for transient hyperkalemia associated with the muscle relaxant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. This increased risk is eliminated by using a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Electrode placement and other aspects of ECT technique for treating catatonia have not been standardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, bitemporal electrode placement and brief pulse current are generally preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ECT is generally given three times per week on alternating days. However, for patients with malignant catatonia, we suggest daily treatments until the patient is physiologically stable, which often occurs within two to five treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,72</a>]. At least six treatments are given regardless of the catatonia subtype to reduce the risk of sudden relapse. Most patients receiving ECT regardless of the indication remit with 6 to 12 treatments, but some patients may require 20 or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. ECT is usually terminated after the acute catatonic episode has remitted, but one case report described maintenance ECT for a patient with recurrent catatonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The decision to continue a benzodiazepine during ECT is determined by the patient&rsquo;s initial response to the medication and the modifications in ECT technique that are required. For patients with a partial but incomplete response to lorazepam, the drug may be continued during ECT to maintain the drug&rsquo;s therapeutic benefit. However, the benzodiazepine should be discontinued if it interferes with ECT (increases seizure threshold and shortens seizure duration) despite adjustments in the ECT technique.

Signs of catatonia are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F53391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53391 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F66229\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66229 \">table 2</a>). The three primary subtypes of catatonia are retarded, excited, and malignant.

Clinicians should avoid using dopamine blocking drugs, even if patients are psychotic, impulsive, or aggressive. Treating catatonia with an antipsychotic is a risk factor for the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Antipsychotics are contraindicated in malignant catatonia. (See <a href=\"#H13927951\" class=\"local\">'Underlying disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13927994\" class=\"local\">'Avoid dopamine blocking drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality in malignant catatonia may increase if electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) does not begin within five days of symptom onset.

A dose of 6 to 21 mg daily is effective for most patients, but a dose of 30 mg per day is occasionally necessary.

Following remission of catatonia, the benzodiazepine should be continued if an antipsychotic drug is used to treat the underlying disorder.
