The incidence is higher after emergent repairs and recurrent hernia repairs compared with elective repair. With the transition to tension-free repair, hernia recurrence is less frequent while other complications, such as post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia, have become more prominent. </p><p>Complications that occur in the perioperative period include wound <span class=\"nowrap\">seroma/hematoma,</span> urinary retention, bladder injury, and superficial wound infection, while complications that occur later following hernia repair include persistent groin pain and post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia, testicular complications, deep <span class=\"nowrap\">wound/mesh</span> infection, recurrent hernia, and mesh migration and erosion. </p><p>Complications associated with inguinal and femoral hernia repair will be reviewed here. The operative techniques for inguinal and femoral hernia repair, including methods to prevent complications related to repair, are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84861144\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications after inguinal or femoral hernia repair are relatively common, with the incidence depending upon the clinical circumstance under which the repair was performed as well as the site and type of the hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Urgent and emergent procedures are associated with higher complication rates compared with elective repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In one review of 1034 groin hernia repairs, overall complication rates were 27 percent for acute hernia repairs and 15.1 percent for elective repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Higher complication rates are also seen with repair of recurrent hernia compared with primary hernia repair. In studies comparing open and laparoscopic repair, the overall incidence of complications is similar; however, the nature of the complications differs. Identifiable differences are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H2242047518\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary hernia'</a>.)</p><p>In a review that included 6895 groin hernia repairs in women and 83,753 in men, although the overall incidence of postoperative complications was similar, the need to resect bowel was higher in women compared with men (16.6 versus 5.6 percent), likely related to the greater proportion of women who required emergency hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, under elective circumstances, women had a slightly lower rate of postoperative complications (7.0 versus 8.5 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282431\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84860505\"><span class=\"h2\">Seroma/hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bruising, seroma, and hematoma formation are relatively common following inguinal and femoral hernia repair. In the surgery versus watchful waiting trial, 6.1 percent of patients undergoing open, mesh repair developed a wound hematoma, 4.5 percent developed a scrotal hematoma, and 1.6 percent developed a seroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Seromas and hematomas are reported in approximately 5 percent of laparoscopic hernia repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Seromas and hematomas are due to the collection of fluid or blood in the dead space that remains once a hernia sac has been reduced. They can present as significant scrotal swelling (if the original hernia involved the scrotum) or inguinal swelling (if the original hernia did not involve the scrotum). </p><p>During laparoscopic access, vascular injury most commonly of the epigastric artery or vein, or external iliac artery or vein, can cause bleeding resulting in hematoma formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H860573093\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Vascular injury'</a>.)</p><p>Seroma or hematoma may be mistaken as (ie, pseudohernia), and must be differentiated from, a hernia recurrence, since the typical clinical presentation is similar (ie, groin mass and pain). Cross-sectional imaging, for example computed tomography (CT), can help distinguish hernia recurrence from a seroma or a hematoma. (See <a href=\"#H84860533\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent hernia'</a> below.)</p><p>Most fluid collections resolve without specific treatment. Fluid collections should not be aspirated in the absence of accompanying clinical features of infection, as this poses a risk for introducing infection into a sterile site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hematomas may spontaneously decompress through the wound, which can be unsettling to the patient but is generally not serious. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84861277\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of urinary retention following laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair varies depending upon the type of anesthesia used and the nature of the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Urinary retention occurs in approximately 2.2 percent of patients if the repair is performed under general anesthesia and 0.4 percent if local anesthesia is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/1,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-14</a>]. </p><p>Following laparoscopic hernia repair, the postoperative urinary retention may be higher with mesh staple fixation compared with glue or no fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the rate of urinary retention was 1 percent for nonfixation and 3.1 percent for staple fixation, although this difference was found to be statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The management of urinary retention is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;, section on 'Acute management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282709\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder injury is a rare complication during open hernia repair, and occurs in less than 1 percent of patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>]. The bladder can be damaged during trocar insertion during initial abdominal access, or during the development of the peritoneal flap. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H860574403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Related to abdominal access'</a>.) </p><p>Bladder injury can also be the result of mesh migration. (See <a href=\"#H54228417\" class=\"local\">'Mesh migration and erosion'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84860512\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial wound infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of superficial wound infection following elective inguinal and femoral hernia repair is overall low. A systematic review of open inguinal hernia repair found rates of infection between 3 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients undergoing mesh repair are at a slightly higher risk of developing an infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The risk of infection may be higher when mesh is used to repair large defects <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the setting of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, immunosuppression, or obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia#H32537617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Patients with infected superficial wounds should be initiated on antibiotic therapy. If available, culture findings should guide choice of therapy; otherwise, empiric broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics should be administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52962 \">table 1</a>). Most patients who develop a superficial wound infection can be successfully treated with antibiotic treatment without the need to remove the prosthetic material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Symptoms of infection should improve after a few days of antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics should be continued for 10 to 14 days or until the clinical signs of active infection have resolved. Thereafter, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of recurrent infection. Oral antibiotics may be used to complete therapy in patients who improve quickly and can tolerate oral therapy. &#160;</p><p>If signs of superficial infection do not improve with antibiotic therapy, a deeper infection may be present and surgical incision and drainage with debridement of infected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrotic tissue may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H345086116\" class=\"local\">'Deep wound/mesh infection'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282552\"><span class=\"h1\">LATER COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282588\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent groin pain and post-herniorraphy neuralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent pain following groin hernia surgery is common. Some form of chronic or residual postoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">discomfort/pain</span> is present after inguinal or femoral hernia repair with reported rates ranging from 0.7 to 43.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/12,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25</a>]. The nature of the pain can vary over time. Pain following hernia surgery should subside within an expected time interval, but when pain persists for more than three months and is shown not to be related to other causes, a presumptive diagnosis of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia can be made. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-herniorrhaphy groin pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282828\"><span class=\"h2\">Testicular complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of testicular complications ranges from 0.3 to 7.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Interference with blood supply to the testicle, typically resulting from the dissection of an indirect hernia from the cord structures (open or laparoscopic), can lead to testicular pain, ischemic orchitis, and testicular atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Complications may also result from direct injury, extrinsic compression of cord structures, or a fibrotic reaction to polypropylene mesh. Transection or obstruction of the vas deferens, which can lead to ejaculatory problems, is of particular concern in young men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345086116\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep wound/mesh infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep wound or mesh graft infections can present within the first few weeks after surgery or later (months to years after surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The incidence of deep wound infection following inguinal hernia repair is similar for open and laparoscopic hernia repair between 0.1 and 0.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, diabetes, glucocorticoid use, and prior hernia surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia#H32537617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.) </p><p>A deep <span class=\"nowrap\">wound/mesh</span> infection should be suspected in any patient with a history of groin hernia repair who presents with fevers, chills, or malaise. Findings on physical examination may include pain, erythema, warmth, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a draining fistula in the groin region. </p><p>The diagnosis of deep <span class=\"nowrap\">wound/mesh</span> infection is usually clinical but imaging modalities such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) can be useful for identifying fluid collections (seroma, hematoma, abscess), edema or stranding of the subcutaneous fat around the mesh, or other signs of tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/necrosis</span>. Patients with clinical manifestations of infection and associated fluid collections should undergo either percutaneous or open drainage, depending on the extent of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Bacteria typically implicated in mesh implant infections are those with the capacity to form biofilm, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Enteric gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes are also potential pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Rarely, mesh infections can be caused by Candida or mycobacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p>The optimal management of infected mesh graft is not well-defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with suspected mesh graft infection should initially be started on empiric broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics with the results of subsequent fluid or tissue culture (aerobic and anaerobic) and sensitivities guiding subsequent choice of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52962 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Patients without systemic signs who have localized fluid collections can undergo an attempt at percutaneous drainage. In a retrospective study that evaluated outcomes in 21 patients who underwent percutaneous drainage for mesh-related fluid collections, 12 patients (57 percent) were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In this study, fluid cultures were positive in 68 percent of patients (n = 13); Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism. However, the pathogen did not predict the need for mesh excision. If symptoms persist following <span class=\"nowrap\">debridement/drainage</span> and one week of appropriate antibiotic therapy, all foreign material including mesh, sutures, staples (as well as necrotic tissue) should be removed, when technically feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Patients who present with systemic symptoms and signs of sepsis and local evidence of a severe infection should undergo immediate surgical debridement of any infected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrotic tissue, and mesh removal. Debrided material should be sent for culture and sensitivities and the results used to tailor choice of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following removal of the mesh or other foreign material, antibiotics should be administered for at least two weeks. If symptoms of infection recur following removal of foreign material, incomplete removal with retention of mesh components should be suspected, and repeat debridement should be undertaken.</p><p>Although graft removal can lead to hernia recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], the infection should be fully eradicated before recurrent hernia repair is performed. Some surgeons favor percutaneous sampling of the operative area under sterile conditions to ensure there are no residual bacteria prior to repeat hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. If such cultures are positive, an additional two weeks of antibiotics should be administered, followed by repeat aspiration. Patients with persistently positive aspirates should undergo repeat debridement followed by additional antibiotic therapy. When needed, methods are available to repair groin hernia without the use of mesh and are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Non-mesh repairs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84860533\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent hernia occurs in 0.5 to 15 percent of patients depending upon the type of hernia repair initially performed, the comorbidities of the patient, and the duration of time from the original hernia repair. Lower rates of hernia recurrence are most correlated with tension-free hernia repair (open or laparoscopic), which is usually accomplished with an intervening layer of mesh (except Shouldice repair). Primary closure of the involved tissues (no mesh) leads to hernia recurrence in up to 15 percent of patients, compared with approximately a 1 to 2 percent recurrence rate for tension-free mesh repair. Recurrence rates for specific repairs and techniques for the repair of recurrent hernia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H28368138\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair-in-adults#H28368252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent inguinal and femoral hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54228417\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesh migration and erosion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following inguinal and femoral hernia repair, erosion of mesh into adjacent structures can occur, and depending upon the symptoms and nature of the structures involved, treatment may require mesh removal.</p><p>Mesh migration can be classified as primary or secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Primary mechanical migration is displacement of the mesh along paths of least resistance due to inadequate fixation or external forces. Secondary migration is the slow and gradual movement of mesh through adjacent anatomic structures as a consequence of a chronic foreign body reaction. As a result of one of these mechanisms, erosion of mesh into the bladder leading to recurrent urinary tract infection or hematuria, erosion into the spermatic cord causing vasal obstruction, and erosion into the gastrointestinal structures causing fistula formation have all been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair/abstract/7,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84860102\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications after inguinal or femoral hernia repair are relatively common with a higher incidence reported after emergent and recurrent hernia repairs compared with elective repair.

The incidence of urinary retention is generally less than 2 percent, but depends upon the type of anesthesia used and nature of the repair. Bladder injury is uncommon but can occur with the abdominal access during laparoscopic hernia repair. Injury to the structures supplying the testes can lead to testicular pain, ischemic orchitis, and other reproductive issues.

(See <a href=\"#H4282588\" class=\"local\">'Persistent groin pain and post-herniorraphy neuralgia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-herniorrhaphy groin pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of recurrent hernia depends upon the type of hernia repair initially performed, the comorbidities of the patient, and the duration of time from the original hernia repair. The lowest recurrence rates of hernia occur with tension-free hernia repair (open or laparoscopic). Hernia recurrence may also result from the need to remove mesh to treat mesh infection or due to erosion of mesh into adjacent structures.
