Atherosclerosis increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack and stroke, when it affects arteries that supply blood to the heart and brain.</p><p>It is unusual for children or teenagers to have a heart attack or stroke as a result of atherosclerosis. This is because vessel narrowing, caused by atherosclerosis, takes many years to develop. However, the process of atherosclerosis begins in childhood. For most children, atherosclerosis is mild and progresses slowly. In some children, atherosclerosis worsens rapidly, increasing the risk of heart disease, and less commonly, stroke in early adult life.</p><p>It is often possible to identify which children are at risk for atherosclerosis and to begin making improvements in lifestyle (like eating a healthy diet and exercising). In addition, medications may be prescribed for children with the greatest likelihood of developing early atherosclerosis. In the sections that follow, we will discuss childhood risk factors for early atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IS MY CHILD AT RISK FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS?</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain factors increase a child's risk of developing early atherosclerosis, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity &minus; Children and teenagers who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol and lipids. In adults, these factors increase the risk for early atherosclerotic disease. Children who are obese are more likely to be obese as adults. In addition, there is increasing evidence that childhood obesity makes it more likely to have other risk factors that are associated with heart disease in early adulthood, such as high blood pressure or diabetes mellitus. The definitions of obesity and overweight for children and teenagers are described below. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure &ndash; Children and adolescents with high blood pressure are more likely to have high blood pressure as adults. High blood pressure in adulthood increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of cardiovascular disease &ndash; Children whose parents or grandparents had a heart attack or stroke at an early age have twice the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. A family history of early-age cardiovascular disease is defined as a parent or grandparent who had a heart attack, a stroke, or peripheral vascular disease (blockages in the large blood vessels of the arms or legs) before the age of 56 years for men or 66 years for women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressive and bipolar disorders &ndash; There is evidence that major depression and bipolar disorder in adolescents are associated with an increased risk of early cardiovascular disease. In addition, other risk factors for cardiovascular disease like obesity, diabetes, and smoking are more common in children and adolescents with major depression or bipolar disorder. As a result, children and adolescents being treated for depression or bipolar disorder should also be monitored for these issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-manic-depression-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bipolar disorder (manic depression) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to cigarette smoke &ndash; Smoking and exposure to smoking increases the risk of developing early cardiovascular disease. <span class=\"nowrap\">Children/teenagers</span> who smoke themselves are likely to continue smoking into adulthood, thus increasing their risk of early cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying medical problems &ndash; Certain underlying medical problems increase the risk of early cardiovascular disease. These include diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart transplantation, Kawasaki disease with coronary aneurysms, and treatment for cancer during childhood. Children with these problems are treated especially vigorously with lifestyle changes and sometimes medications to lower their risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases associated with atherosclerosis in childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Is testing for risk factors recommended?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for cholesterol problems is recommended once for children ages 9 to 11 years and again at ages 17 to 21 years. Additionally, children ages two years and older who have one or more of the following risks should be screened (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63578\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63578 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of high cholesterol or lipids, or early cardiovascular disease.

The decision about when to start treatment depends upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of risk for future heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of side effects of the treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of the treatment</p><p/><p>Making healthy lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight control, avoiding smoking) is effective and has few risks. The use of a medication(s) requires more careful consideration. For each child or teenager, the clinical provider will work to individualize a treatment plan that has the greatest potential benefits and fewest risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND LIPIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesterol and lipids are measured by testing the blood level of several components, including total cholesterol, LDL (bad cholesterol), HDL (good cholesterol), and triglycerides. The most accurate time to measure these levels is before the first meal or drink of the day, 8 to 12 hours after the last meal (called fasting).</p><p>The following levels are considered abnormal and may indicate a need for treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total cholesterol &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol &gt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triglycerides (TG) &gt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment for high cholesterol includes a combination of changes in diet and increased activity. These treatments are usually recommended for at least 6 to 12 months before considering the use of medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents of children with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels should offer their child a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. Increasing fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy products, beans, fish, and lean proteins can help to meet this goal.</p><p>Children with high triglycerides should eat a diet without excessive carbohydrates, particularly &quot;refined&quot; carbohydrates (white rice, pasta, bread, desserts), which raise blood sugar and are low in fiber.</p><p>Meeting with a dietitian or nutritionist can help families to set realistic, individual goals and make long-lasting changes. In most cases, the entire family should change their diet together to maximize the child's chances of success. More than one visit with a nutritionist is often necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing daily activity can help to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and improve cholesterol levels. Most expert groups recommend that children get 30 to 60 minutes of exercise four to six days per week.</p><p>For children who are not already active, the increase in activity should be gradual. For example, the initial goal may be to ride a bicycle outside for 10 minutes 3 times per week. Other options include joining a gym or YMCA, riding an exercise bike, or running on a treadmill; activity should be tailored to the child's age and interests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary supplements containing fiber and omega-3 fatty acids are sometimes used to decrease LDL cholesterol. However, the best source of fiber is from dietary sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The best source of omega-3 fatty acids is fish. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If changes in diet and activity do not decrease cholesterol levels enough after 6 to 12 months, or if a child's cholesterol or triglyceride levels are very high, one or more medications may be recommended. Medications do not permanently cure the problem but work to lower the child's risk factors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used medication to treat high cholesterol belongs to a class of drugs called statins. Several statins are approved for use in children. These medications are usually taken in pill form, once per day. More detailed information about use of statins in children is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-the-child-at-risk-for-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of the child at risk for atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, the normal range for blood pressure (BP) is determined by the child's gender, age, and height. The normal range is expressed as a percentile, similar to charts used to track children's height and weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>As an example, if a child's BP is at the 90th percentile, this means that 90 percent of children who are that age, gender, and height have a lower BP.</p><p>A child's blood pressure percentile can be calculated here for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or here for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p>Blood pressure may change in response to an individual's emotions and environment. Hypertension (sustained high blood pressure) is not usually diagnosed until blood pressure is measured as high on three separate occasions when the child is calm and in a quiet environment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">When is treatment needed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lifestyle changes (diet and increased activity) are initially recommended for most children with hypertension. One or more medications may be recommended if lifestyle changes are not effective, if the blood pressure is very elevated, or if the child has an underlying medical problem that causes high blood pressure.</p><p>Treatment of high blood pressure in children is discussed in detail in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">OBESITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight in relation to height, and is currently the best way to determine whether a child (&gt;2 years of age) is overweight or obese.</p><p>Because children grow in height as well as weight, a &quot;normal&quot; BMI depends upon the child's age and sex. A tool that calculates BMI for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-boys-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 3</a>) and girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-girls-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 4</a>) is available here.</p><p>Children whose BMI is &ge;85th percentile are considered to be overweight while children whose BMI is &ge;95th percentile are considered to be obese.</p><p>Treatment is generally recommended for children whose BMI is &ge;95th percentile for age and gender. Treatment usually includes making changes in diet, behavior, and increasing physical activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">CIGARETTE SMOKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients and family members who smoke are counseled to quit smoking. Smoking, as well as exposure to second-hand smoke, has many health risks. Approaches to quitting smoking are described separately.
