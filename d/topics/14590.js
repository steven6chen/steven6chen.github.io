These conditions, which are also known as &ldquo;dual diagnoses,&rdquo; are associated with poor adherence to treatment and poorer outcomes when the co-occurring disorder is present.</p><p>Some of the symptoms of schizophrenia overlap with symptoms of intoxication, chronic use, or withdrawal from alcohol or other drugs. Family history and the temporal relationship of symptoms can help to distinguish patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) alone from co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD.<strong> </strong></p><p>The psychiatric diagnoses in DSM-IV-TR, substance abuse and substance dependence, were replaced by one diagnosis, SUD, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, substance dependence is approximately comparable to SUD, moderate to severe subtype, while substance abuse is similar to the mild subtype.</p><p>Psychosocial interventions for patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD are described here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and SUD are described separately. Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia occurring alone and specific substance use disorders occurring alone are also discussed separately.

There is wide variability across the United States and internationally in the availability and content of psychosocial interventions for these disorders. In addition to the psychosocial interventions described here, treatment of SUD generally includes addiction counseling or psychotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuing care for addiction: Implementation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with the co-occurring disorders, an intervention that reduces substance use can have secondary benefits on symptoms of schizophrenia (and vice versa). As examples, a patient with SUD who maintains abstinence may have better adherence to antipsychotic medication and thus fewer exacerbations. A patient with schizophrenia who is experiencing fewer psychotic symptoms may be better able to focus on and maintain abstinence.</p><p>Interventions described in this topic are organized by the primary disorder they were developed to address; those that are used principally to treat schizophrenia include (see <a href=\"#H1406723344\" class=\"local\">'Schizophrenia'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skills training </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family-based educational interventions</p><p/><p>Interventions used principally to treat SUD include (see <a href=\"#H2648774279\" class=\"local\">'Substance use disorders'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motivational interviewing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutual help groups such as 12-step programs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contingency management</p><p/><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been modified and applied effectively to treat schizophrenia individually and SUD individually.
