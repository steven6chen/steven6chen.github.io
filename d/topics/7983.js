An &quot;embryo&quot; is the term doctors use to describe when a baby starts to grow. Each embryo grows into a baby.</p><p>Identical twins have all of the same genes. They are the same sex and look very much alike. Identical twins are less common than fraternal twins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344915\"><span class=\"h1\">What are fraternal twins and how do they happen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fraternal twins happen when 2 different eggs are fertilized by 2 different sperm. Then there are 2 embryos, each of which grows into a baby.</p><p>Fraternal twins share some, but not all, of the same genes. They are like any 2 siblings, but just share the same birthday. Fraternal twins can be 2 girls, 2 boys, or a boy and a girl.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344930\"><span class=\"h1\">What increases a woman's chances of having twins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain things increase a woman's chances of having twins. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being in her 30s or older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicine to help get pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a procedure called &quot;in vitro fertilization&quot; (also called &quot;IVF&quot;) to help get pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Her race &ndash; Twins are more common in black women than in Asian or white women.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a family history of twins</p><p/><p>These things mostly increase a woman's chances of having fraternal twins only, not identical twins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344945\"><span class=\"h1\">How does my doctor or midwife know that I'm having twins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When your doctor or midwife examines you, he or she will feel the size of your uterus (womb) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>). Women who are having twins usually have a uterus that is bigger than expected, given their due date. Also, early in pregnancy, your doctor or midwife will probably do a test called an ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of your body. This test shows how many babies are in your uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344977\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need special prenatal care?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are pregnant with twins, you will need special prenatal care. You will see your doctor or midwife more often. You will also have frequent ultrasounds to check how your babies are growing. Later on in pregnancy, you might have other tests to check your babies' health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344992\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about having twins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having twins is a bit different than having only 1 baby. Your doctor or midwife will talk with you about how much weight you should gain and how active you should be.</p><p>He or she will also talk with you about problems that are more likely to happen when a woman is pregnant with twins. The most common problem is that the babies will be born too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy (3 or more weeks before the due date). Doctors use the word &quot;premature&quot; or &quot;preterm&quot; for babies who are born too early.</p><p>Being born too early is sometimes a problem. Preterm babies are more likely to be smaller and need to stay in the hospital for longer after birth. They are also more likely to have medical problems, such as breathing problems.</p><p>If your twins are identical, your doctor or midwife will use ultrasounds to check for a problem called &quot;twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.&quot; This is a problem with the placenta that can sometimes happen in a pregnancy with identical twins. (The placenta is the organ inside a pregnant woman's uterus that brings a baby nutrients and oxygen, and carries away waste.) If you have this problem, your doctor or midwife will monitor you closely and suggest treatment if needed.</p><p>Women who are carrying twins are also more likely to get high blood pressure during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600345007\"><span class=\"h1\">How will I deliver my babies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the position of the babies in your uterus, your health, and your babies' health. If you and your babies are healthy and the first baby is coming head first, you might be able to deliver your babies vaginally. If not, the doctor will do surgery called a c-section to get the babies out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600345022\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my twins are identical or fraternal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twins of the opposite sex are always fraternal. Twins of the same sex can be fraternal or identical.</p><p>If your twins are the same sex, your doctor or midwife might be able to tell if they are identical by checking your placenta. They can use ultrasound to do this before birth, or examine the placenta after birth. Sometimes, the only way to tell if twins are identical is by doing blood tests on the babies after they are born.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600345039\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I breastfeed my babies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you would like to. Most women make enough milk to breastfeed twins. If your babies are born too early, you might need to pump and store your breast milk until your babies are able to drink it.</p><p>You will probably want to work with a breastfeeding expert, called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot; That way, you can find a schedule and way of breastfeeding that works best for you and your babies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600345054\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am having a tough time taking care of my babies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are having a tough time, try to get some help. Taking care of twins can be tiring and stressful. You might want to ask friends or relatives to help you. Many parents also find it helpful to join a support group for parents of twins. That way, they can talk to others in the same situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600345069\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-a-baby-is-born-premature-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When a baby is born premature (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
