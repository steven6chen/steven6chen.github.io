These disorders are caused by defects in the synthesis (ie, dysmyelination) or maintenance of the myelin sheath that insulates the nerves. While leukodystrophy is the predominant abnormality in the neonatal and infantile forms of Alexander disease, advances in genetics and imaging have revealed a broad phenotypic variability that includes juvenile and adult forms of the disorder without obvious leukodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Prior to the identification of the genetic features, other names were used to describe the clinical features and pathology of Alexander disease, such as hyaline panneuropathy and dysmyelinogenic leukodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These terms are no longer used.</p><p>This topic will review the pathology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of Alexander disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alexander disease was first described in 1949, when W. Stewart Alexander reported a 15-month-old child with megalencephaly, hydrocephalus, and psychomotor retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The child died eight months later, and the brain pathology revealed &quot;a progressive fibrinoid degeneration of fibrillary astrocytes.&quot; These astrocytic inclusions were later found to be identical to Rosenthal fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in Rosenthal fibers led to the identification of mutations of the gene encoding GFAP as the cause of Alexander disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Rosenthal fibers, which are hyaline eosinophilic rods, are present in Alexander disease throughout the central nervous system. These intracytoplasmic astrocytic inclusions are the hallmark of Alexander disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. They are commonly seen in subpial, subependymal, and perivascular regions. They are present in the perikarya, processes, and end-feet of astrocytes and appear round or oblong, with extensive glial intermediate filaments seen on electron microscopy. They also contain GFAP. In addition, alpha B-crystallin, heat shock protein 27, and ubiquitin are present in Rosenthal fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>Rosenthal fibers are not specific for Alexander disease; focal Rosenthal fibers are found in other conditions, including astrocytomas, hamartomas, glial scars, and even in multiple sclerosis. However, the focal nature of Rosenthal fibers in these disorders stands in sharp contrast to Alexander disease, where the Rosenthal fibers are diffuse and abundant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Myelin loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure of normal myelin development in Alexander disease are variable. In the infantile form, the myelin loss is severe. Patients with juvenile or adult-onset Alexander disease can have mild and patchy myelin loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2001, nonconservative mutations were identified in the regions of chromosome 17q21 that encode the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene from patients representing different Alexander disease phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. GFAP is an intermediate filament protein found in mature astrocytes that is rapidly synthesized during central nervous system injury and reactive astrogliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Astrocytes also help maintain the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>] and have many additional functions.</p><p>Mutations of the GFAP gene are thought to result in a gain of function phenotype that disrupts dimerization of GFAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This leads to cytoskeletal collapse and abnormal protein aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatively, the accumulation of a toxic substance could interrupt filament assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the precise interactions between the GFAP mutations and the cellular responses of astrocytes remain unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alexander disease is rare, but its true incidence and prevalence are unknown. Since Alexander's initial description, fewer than 450 patients have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Nevertheless, in a series from Germany, Alexander disease accounted for 1.6 percent of all leukodystrophies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alexander disease predominantly affects infants and children, but can affect adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726209103\"><span class=\"h2\">Traditional classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four subtypes of Alexander disease (neonatal, infantile, juvenile, and adult) are traditionally recognized. However, the traditional clinical classification of Alexander disease does not predict the disease severity and progression with reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neonatal form is associated with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure secondary to aqueductal stenosis, as well as elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein, intractable seizures, severe motor retardation (even in the absence of upper motor neuron signs), and intellectual disability. In contrast to the infantile form, ataxia and hyperreflexia are not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the neonatal form, death usually occurs within the first few weeks to years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], although some affected infants survive until the end of the first decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Infantile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infantile form is the most common, accounting for approximately 42 percent of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The onset occurs before the age of two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Infants and young children have psychomotor retardation with loss of developmental milestones, spasticity, and feeding difficulties. Affected infants may have head enlargement (macrocephaly) secondary to brain enlargement (megalencephaly), frontal bossing, seizures, and hydrocephalus. Death usually occurs in the first years of life, although some children with infantile-onset Alexander disease survive until the early teenage years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Juvenile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The juvenile phenotype, seen in approximately 22 percent of affected patients, typically presents between ages 4 and 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. It is associated with pseudobulbar and bulbar signs, including swallowing and speech difficulties. Patients may have vomiting, ataxia, spasticity (principally affecting the lower extremities), and kyphoscoliosis. There have been three case reports of children with Alexander disease who presented with symptoms suggestive of anorexia nervosa (including failure to thrive, nocturnal vomiting, and weight loss) at ages 6, 7, and 11, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Unlike in the infantile form, children with juvenile Alexander disease are typically normocephalic, and have a slow deterioration of cognitive abilities. Although progressive and fatal, the deterioration is often slower than the infantile form, with survival ranging from 15 months to 12 years from disease onset in an early report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and to the third and fourth decades of life in later reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Adult</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult-onset Alexander disease (approximately 33 percent of affected patients) has variable features, including progressive ataxia, and bulbar and pseudobulbar signs such as palatal myoclonus, dysphagia, dysphonia, and dysarthria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25-28</a>]. Spasticity, quadriparesis, urinary disturbances, dysautonomia, and dysmorphic features may also be present.</p><p>In the largest series of 11 cases, onset occurred up to age 62 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Bulbar symptoms, mainly dysarthria, dysphagia, and dysphonia, were the most common, but were infrequent at presentation. Pyramidal involvement, cerebellar ataxia, disturbances of ocular movement (nystagmus, saccadic pursuit, diplopia), palatal myoclonus, sphincter abnormalities, and sleep disorders were also common. Two patients were asymptomatic but were suspected of having Alexander disease after MRI was obtained for other indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Atrophy of the medulla on brain MRI was a characteristic finding.</p><p>Additional manifestations reported in individual families or cases include dysmorphic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], microcoria (congenital pupillary constriction), endocrine disturbances (amenorrhea and hypothyroidism), mood disturbance, and episodic hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Imaging abnormalities, particularly in the brainstem and cerebellum, may precede the clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Brain MRI'</a> below.)</p><p>The neuroophthalmologic and oculomotor findings reflect dysfunction in the pons and cerebellum, consistent with neuroimaging studies. The adult form may result from a sporadic mutation; however, familial cases have been reported more commonly among adult-onset patients than in the infantile or juvenile forms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Inheritance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726209142\"><span class=\"h2\">Revised classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification of Alexander disease was revised in 2011 on the basis of a statistical method called latent class analysis (LCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Using data from 215 patients with genetically confirmed Alexander disease, LCA modeling was applied to define clinically coherent subtypes of Alexander disease with similar outcomes. The result suggested that the optimal number of Alexander disease subtypes is two (types I and II). Of note, the LCA models predict trends but do not allow type classification of individual cases with absolute certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Common features of types I and II are reviewed in the next sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726209163\"><span class=\"h3\">Type I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I Alexander disease is characterized by the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early onset (often but not always before age four years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrocephaly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor delay</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to thrive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental delay</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal deterioration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical neuroimaging features (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Brain MRI'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Type I Alexander disease is generally more severe than type II, with a reduced median survival from onset (14 versus 25 years) and a nearly twofold increase in mortality for type I compared with type II. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726209195\"><span class=\"h3\">Type II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type II Alexander disease is characterized by the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifests across the lifespan, usually but not always age four years or older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye movement abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulbar symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palatal myoclonus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Often lacking neurocognitive or developmental deficits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical neuroimaging features (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Atypical neuroimaging features'</a> below)</p><p/><p>As noted above, type II Alexander disease is generally less severe and has a longer median survival than type I (see <a href=\"#H726209163\" class=\"local\">'Type I'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ninety-eight percent of the cases of Alexander disease are associated with mutations in the coding region of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/5,16,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,32</a>]. Over 75 GFAP mutations have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/16,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31</a>]. In the largest report, an analysis of 215 patients with genetically confirmed Alexander disease, more than one-half of the patients had mutations affecting one of four GFAP peptide sequences (R79, R88, R239, and R416) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alexander-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
