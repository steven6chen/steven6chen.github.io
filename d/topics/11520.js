The formation of inflammatory lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may involve lymphocytes and monocytes that gain access to the brain parenchyma from the circulation by first adhering to vascular endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Alpha-4 integrin is expressed on the surface of inflammatory lymphocytes and monocytes and may play a critical role in their adhesion to the vascular endothelium through molecules such as VCAM-1.</p><p>Treatment with alpha-4 integrin antagonists in rodent models of MS led to reduced signs of disease activity and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In a preliminary six-month clinical trial of 213 patients with MS, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> treatment was associated with significantly fewer new enhancing brain lesions on MRI and significantly fewer relapses compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In patients with MS, natalizumab treatment is associated with a diminished migratory capacity of immune cells and a prolonged decrease in lymphocyte counts in the cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H942341024\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> is one of several disease-modifying agents (DMTs) that effectively reduce the relapse rate for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The main concern with natalizumab therapy is the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The choice of a specific agent for patients with RRMS should be individualized according to disease activity and patient values and preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F102519\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102519 \">algorithm 1</a>), as discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>). In this context, we suggest infusion therapy with natalizumab for patients with more active RRMS and for those who value effectiveness above safety and convenience, including use of natalizumab as a first-line agent. In contrast, earlier guidelines (published in 2008) by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommended that natalizumab be reserved for patients with RRMS who failed other therapies because of continued disease activity or medication intolerance, or who had a very aggressive initial disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As of August 2017, approximately 174,000 patients worldwide had received natalizumab in the postmarketing period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a>, rigorous clinical and neuroimaging follow-up is essential in order to detect the onset of symptoms and signs related to PML as opposed to those related to MS. The risk of PML varies according to three main risk factors (see <a href=\"#H7950870\" class=\"local\">'PML risk stratification'</a> below), which are previous immunosuppressant treatment, anti-JCV antibody status, and duration of natalizumab treatment. These factors should be assessed and monitored routinely (see <a href=\"#H3156478281\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance for PML'</a> below) so that the risk of PML can be properly evaluated. Natalizumab should be discontinued when there is suspicion for PML or when the risk of continued treatment outweighs the apparent benefits, though this is a subjective judgment that varies from patient to patient. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk of PML'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the risk of PML, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> should not be used for patients who may have impaired immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. We suggest stopping glucocorticoids and other immunomodulators for at least one month prior to starting natalizumab.

In addition, natalizumab significantly reduced the risk for experiencing progression at two years (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one new exacerbation at two years was 4 (95% CI 3-5) and the NNT to prevent progression at two years was 10 (95% CI 7-23). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the AFFIRM trial, 942 patients with relapsing MS were randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> 300 mg (n = 627), or placebo (n = 315) by intravenous infusion every four weeks for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Natalizumab treatment was associated with a statistically significant 68 percent reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with placebo treatment at one year (0.26 versus 0.81), a reduction that was maintained at two years, and with a significant reduction in the cumulative probability of sustained disability progression at two years (17 versus 29 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the SENTINEL trial, 1171 patients with relapsing MS who continued to experience disease activity despite interferon beta-1a treatment were randomly assigned to also receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> 300 mg (n = 589) or placebo (n = 582) by intravenous infusion every four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. All patients continued to receive interferon beta-1a throughout the trial. The study was stopped about one month early because two patients developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk of PML'</a> below). Combination therapy (natalizumab plus interferon beta-1a) was associated with a statistically significant 54 percent reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with placebo at one year (0.38 versus 0.82), a difference that was maintained at two years, and with a significant reduction in the risk of sustained disability progression at two years (23 versus 29 percent).</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> was beneficial in all analyses of primary and secondary endpoints in both the AFFIRM and SENTINEL trials, indicating the robust nature of the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, natalizumab treatment as monotherapy (in AFFIRM) or combination therapy (in SENTINEL) was associated with an 83 percent reduction in the number of new or enlarging hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI. Finally, natalizumab treatment was associated with improved health-related quality of life compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The reduction in the annualized relapse rate seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> in these trials (54 to 68 percent) compares favorably with the reduction seen with interferon beta or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> treatment in clinical trials (about 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, indirect comparisons of effectiveness across trials do not provide compelling evidence of an advantage for natalizumab, and there are no randomized trials comparing natalizumab monotherapy directly with other disease modifying agents. In the absence of such trials, the 2008 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines concluded that the relative effectiveness of natalizumab compared with current disease modifying agents cannot be defined accurately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nevertheless, many experts believe that natalizumab is more effective than other available MS disease modifying treatments based upon clinical experience, and indirect comparisons also suggest (but do not prove) that natalizumab is as or more effective than other disease modifying therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of PML</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> treatment is associated with a risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a potentially fatal neurologic disease caused by reactivation of JC virus (JCV) infection.

Natalizumab was reintroduced to the US and European markets in mid-2006 for use only as monotherapy to treat relapsing forms of MS. Thereafter additional cases of PML associated with natalizumab therapy began to emerge. As of September, 2017, there were 749 cases of natalizumab-associated PML reported worldwide, for an overall incidence of 4.2 per 1000 patients (95% CI 3.9-4.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These limitations included outdated PML incidence estimates, underestimates of risk for patients with prior immunosuppression, problems due to risk stratification by treatment epoch (ie, 0 to 24, 25 to 48, and 48 to 72 months), and low specificity of the anti-JCV antibody status. As examples, risk stratification by treatment epoch is subject to immortal time bias because some patients stop <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> treatment within an epoch, altering the risk for the remaining patients on treatment. Furthermore, the average risk calculated for the duration of a treatment epoch obscures the actual cumulative nature of risk (eg, the risk of PML within the 25 to 48 month epoch is likely to be higher at the end than at the beginning). In addition, the risk by treatment epoch is not accurate for long-term treatment particularly at the higher end, as the number of patients treated with natalizumab for long periods (many years) is relatively low.</p><p>Detailed PML risks are provided in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114063 \">figure 1</a>).
