Early assessment should focus on identifying an open fracture, neurovascular compromise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated injuries. The correct radiographic diagnosis at the time of injury is essential to proper care.</p><p>Initial care of nondisplaced fractures consists of pain control, splinting, and measures aimed at reducing swelling. Nondisplaced distal forearm fractures other than complete fractures of the distal radius and ulna can then be referred for scheduled evaluation and further management by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise.</p><p>Closed reduction is adequate treatment for many displaced forearm fractures and is often accomplished under sedation in the emergency department. Prompt orthopedic consultation is indicated for an important subset of these fractures to ensure the best outcome. Early orthopedic follow-up for potentially unstable fractures is essential to avoid long-term complications.</p><p>The diagnosis of distal forearm fractures in children will be reviewed here. Management, fracture reduction, and casting of distal forearm fractures and the care of pediatric midshaft forearm fractures is discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed reduction and casting of distal forearm fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft forearm fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2133694\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forearm fractures are among the most common fractures in children, representing 40 to 50 percent of all childhood fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The distal third of the forearm, involving the radius <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulna, is the most common location, accounting for about 75 percent of forearm fractures and 20 to 25 percent of all pediatric fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This high incidence can be explained by increased body mass in relation to an overall decreased bone mineral content during growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most of these fractures will occur in children older than five years (peak age 10 to 14).</p><p>The type of fracture varies by age (see <a href=\"#H732412\" class=\"local\">'Specific fractures'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Torus (buckle) and greenstick fractures occur most frequently in children younger than 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/1-3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physeal separations (ie, fractures involving the growth plate) are more likely in patients older than 10 years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete fractures occur most commonly in adolescents in the midst of a growth spurt.</p><p/><p>The location of fractures has also been noted to advance distally with an increase in age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2133701\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons all work together in stabilizing the forearm. An interosseous membrane connects the radius and ulna, and the radius rotates around the ulna during supination and pronation of the forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78612 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64025 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/1,3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5-7</a>].</p><p>The two areas where the radius and ulna meet, at the elbow and the wrist, are called the radioulnar articulations. The distal radial-ulnar joint (DRUJ) is stabilized by the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 3</a>). Because of the interosseous membrane and these articulations, any disruption or distal fracture of one bone is usually accompanied by fracture to the other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53716\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53716 \">image 1</a>) and may cause a tear in the TFCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/1,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7</a>]. Thus, if only one bone appears to be fractured, the clinician should check the proximal and distal joints for injury to the other bone or the joint.</p><p>The articular surface of both the radius and ulna is initially formed by the epiphysis, which is separated from the metaphysis by the physis or the cartilaginous growth plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The physeal area, where longitudinal growth occurs, is firmly connected to the metaphysis by periosteum, and is difficult to separate by injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The distal radial and ulnar physes account for 75 to 80 percent of forearm growth and almost half of upper extremity growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The porous nature of bones in children makes them more flexible than in adults, and thus, they are able to tolerate more bending and deformation before a fracture occurs. The periosteum around the bones in children is thick and strong and provides some mechanical stability after fracture. It is less readily torn than periosteum in adults, but when it is torn, a fracture becomes displaced. Rapid growth in children and abundant blood supply to the distal radius and ulna permits excellent healing and remodeling of forearm fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/5,6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,10</a>]. The site of the injury and age of the child determine to what extent the deformity can remodel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures near the growth plate remodel best in the plane of motion of the joint (flexion and extension).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small deformities from fractures without reduction or after incomplete reduction are corrected by growth of the physis and periosteum. Bone is resorbed on the convex side and formed on the concave side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. Even malaligned physeal fractures may have excellent results over time, especially in young children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70353\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70353 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729812\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) accounts for most forearm fractures in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/2,5,6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,11,12</a>]. When falling, a child usually braces against the fall with the arm while extending the wrist. This arm position puts maximum axial force onto the forearm.</p><p>Common high-risk activities include snowboarding, skateboarding, skimboarding, soccer goalkeeping, and horseback riding, although any activity that results in a fall with sufficient force can cause a distal forearm fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Wrist guards have been shown to reduce the risk of fracture associated with snowboarding by 71 percent (95% CI: 13-90 percent) and are also recommended for inline skating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Most forearm fractures result from falls on an outstretched arm and are not associated with multiple trauma. However, children who fall from a height greater than three times their standing height or sustain a distal forearm fracture as a result of another major trauma mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) are at risk for multiple trauma and warrant a complete physical examination and appropriate ancillary studies.

If radiographs are not readily available, then ultrasonography by a trained examiner can detect distal forearm fractures in children with high sensitivity and specificity. (See <a href=\"#H19771651\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiographs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19771574\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732244\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondisplaced Salter I fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a nondisplaced Salter I physeal fracture of the distal radius or ulna (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 5</a>) usually have normal plain radiographs at initial presentation. However, bony tenderness is present over the physis in these patients and helps to differentiate this injury from a bruise or ligamentous strain or sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other radiographic findings that may be present soon after injury include a volar fat pad on the lateral view and epiphyseal widening on stress views. However, stress views are painful for the patient and usually unnecessary. Plain radiographs obtained at least seven days after injury will show healing bone in children with nondisplaced Salter I fractures and also provides a definitive diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H730609\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19771651\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When obtaining radiographs in the child with a suspected distal forearm fracture, the necessary films should be taken with minimal movement of the extremity. In patients with an obvious deformity or where high suspicion for a displaced fracture exists, analgesia (eg, intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a>) and splinting is advisable prior to obtaining radiographs. Otherwise, a sling typically provides adequate support of nondisplaced fractures and allows for radiographs to be obtained more easily.

A good AP view of the forearm should have minimal superimposition of the radial tuberosity (located at the proximal radius) over the proximal ulna, and similar radiographic density for the proximal and distal forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60234\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60234 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66832\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66832 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A true lateral view of the forearm has superimposition of the radial head upon the ulnar coronoid process at the proximal end, superimposition of the radius and ulna at the distal end, a view of the soft tissues around both bones, and an elbow position that is 90 degrees of flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65236 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is concern about a wrist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elbow fracture or dislocation based upon physical findings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initial forearm radiographs, the clinician should order separate wrist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elbow radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In addition, supracondylar fractures may complicate forearm fractures and cause an associated compartment syndrome.

Ulnar physeal injuries are much less common and typically occur in conjunction with radial fractures. When there is injury to the radial or ulnar physis, circulation typically remains unaffected, and growth is usually not disturbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The Salter-Harris system is the most commonly used classification scheme for describing these fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 5</a>).

If the fracture extends completely through the distal radius and ulna, the extension of the hand during these falls gives a characteristic deformity to these fractures sometimes referred to as the dinner fork deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66531 \">figure 6</a>). A fall on a flexed hand results in the opposite deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69020\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69020 \">image 6</a>).

However, most centers still use plain radiographs for diagnosis of forearm fractures and bedside fluoroscopy to check adequacy of fracture reduction. Further evidence is needed to determine if ultrasound can be performed instead of plain radiography. However, given the high specificity of bedside ultrasonography when performed by an experienced physician, limitation of plain radiographs to patients who are ultrasound negative appears to be a reasonable strategy. </p><p>Based upon a metaanalysis of 12 studies with a total enrollment of 951 children (18 years of age and younger), ultrasound detects distal forearm fractures with a pooled sensitivity of 98 percent and a specificity of 96 percent using plain radiographs as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These findings correspond to an estimated 3 out of 100 distal forearm fractures missed by ultrasound. In most studies, the ultrasound was performed at bedside by the managing physician rather than by a radiologist. Thus, ultrasound by a trained and experienced physician is a viable alternative to plain radiographs for the diagnosis of distal forearm fractures when plain radiographs are not readily available. The six-view ultrasound technique is associated with the best sensitivity and specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108758 \">figure 8</a>). </p><p>In two studies not included in the aforementioned metaanalysis, ultrasound was less painful than plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Furthermore, some emergency physicians have used ultrasound successfully to guide distal forearm fracture reductions and determine when the fracture has been adequately reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2133715\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with distal forearm fractures usually have a history of a fall on an outstretched arm with swelling, bony pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity accompanied by limited range of motion of the hand, wrist, and forearm.

Signs of an open fracture may be subtle because the bone often pokes through the skin and then retracts, leaving only a small puncture wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63726\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63726 \">picture 2</a>). In contrast to an abrasion or puncture from the outside of the arm overlying the fracture site, a small puncture resulting from an open fracture tends to ooze blood. If no active bleeding is noted, the clinician should attempt to express blood through the wound site as circumferential pressure will bring blood to the surface from a small open fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Presence and location of tenderness or swelling</strong> &ndash; When there is no obvious deformity, tenderness over the distal radius or ulna <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased grip strength indicates an increased likelihood of a fracture being present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In particular, nondisplaced Salter I physeal fractures may be very subtle on examination because of a relatively intact range of motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 5</a>). However, the clinician will find localized tenderness over the distal physis in these patients.

The patient should perform active range of motion of all joints that can safely be moved without exacerbating the injury (eg, supination, pronation, flexion, and extension or the elbow; abduction, adduction, internal and external rotation of the shoulder).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Associated injuries</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> When there is an isolated fracture evident in the radius or ulna, the clinician should check the joints above and below the fracture site for other injuries. Supracondylar fractures occasionally complicate forearm fractures in children. Patients with a forearm fracture and a supracondylar elbow fracture (&quot;floating elbow&quot;) are at increased risk of an acute compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

The type and location of fracture varies by age with torus (buckle) and greenstick fractures most frequently occurring in children under 10 years of age, physeal (growth plate) fractures more likely in patients over 10 years of age, and complete fractures most common in adolescents. Older children tend to have more distal fracture location when compared to younger children. (See <a href=\"#H2133694\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child with a distal forearm fracture typically has a history of a fall on an outstretched hand with swelling, bony pain, and deformity. (See <a href=\"#H2136323\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination of children with distal forearm fractures should focus on the presence of open wounds near the fracture site, careful neurovascular assessment, and identification of any injury to the wrist or elbow joints. Because of the anatomy of the interosseous membrane and the radioulnar articulations, any disruption or distal fracture of one bone is usually accompanied by fracture to the other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53716\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53716 \">image 1</a>) and may cause a tear in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 3</a>). Thus, if only one bone appears to be fractured, the clinician should check the proximal and distal joints for injury to the other bone or the joint. (See <a href=\"#H2133701\" class=\"local\">'Pertinent anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2133715\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with an obvious deformity or high suspicion for a displaced fracture, analgesia (eg, intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a>) and splinting is advisable prior to obtaining radiographs. Otherwise, a sling typically provides adequate support of nondisplaced fractures and allows for radiographs to be obtained more easily. Adequate analgesia also facilitates a better assessment of sensory and motor function during physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H730609\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2133715\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the exception of nondisplaced Salter I physeal (growth plate) fractures or physeal microfractures (or &quot;bone bruises&quot;), plain radiographs of the forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60234\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60234 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66832\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66832 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65236 \">image 4</a>) provide the diagnosis.

However, bony tenderness is present over the physis in these patients, and this finding helps to differentiate this injury from a bruise or ligamentous strain or sprain. Plain radiographs obtained at least seven days after injury usually will show healing bone in children with nondisplaced Salter I fractures and also provides a definitive diagnosis. However, microfractures or a &quot;bone bruise&quot; of the physis may only be apparent upon magnetic resonance imaging with fat suppression.
