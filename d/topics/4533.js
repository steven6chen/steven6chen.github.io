Compared with controls with recognizable disease, patients with conversion disorder are more likely to have a history of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (eg, depressive, anxiety, and personality disorders) and unexplained symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>]. In addition, conversion disorder is often preceded by neurologic illnesses (eg, migraine, peripheral nerve pathology, or stroke) that appear to trigger, but do not explain the conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Physical injury may also precede conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>An excess of symptom modeling (copying the symptoms of others) has been reported in some studies of conversion disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>] but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13165779\"><span class=\"h2\">Perpetuating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversion symptoms may be perpetuated by beliefs that there is an irreversible neurologic disease, which may create a powerful obstacle to rehabilitation.

In addition, conversion symptoms may be perpetuated by physical deconditioning, comorbid psychiatric disorders, disability-related financial benefits, and litigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. Another potential perpetuating factor is life stress (eg, work or family) that was relieved by onset of the disorder and would probably recur if the patient was to recover from conversion disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13156110\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypotheses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several hypothetical models attempt to explain how conversion symptoms develop; these models are not mutually exclusive. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13156124\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive-behavioral models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple overlapping cognitive-behavioral models have been proposed to explain the etiology and pathogenesis of conversion disorder.</p><p>One cognitive-behavioral model is based upon findings that processing of perception and behavior mostly occurs outside of awareness, and proposes that conversion symptoms may result from psychological influences at these lower levels of processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is suggested that patients with conversion disorder initially encounter (in themselves or others) a stimulus for a particular symptom, such as mild weakness from migraine. This generates a mental representation or memory of paralysis. Excessive anxiety about becoming paralyzed, and hypervigilance in looking for evidence (eg, weakness) of paralysis in oneself, may activate the mental representation to the point that it overrides sensory input and distorts awareness and behavior. Selective attentional bias leads patients to persistently focus upon evidence that they are paralyzed and ignore evidence that they are not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Some studies suggest that patients with conversion disorder may lack explicit awareness of their own emotional symptoms, such as anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p>Another cognitive-behavioral model proposes that conversion disorder involves dissociative experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Dissociation is subjectively perceived as disconnection from oneself (depersonalization) or the environment (derealization). During dissociation, awareness and integration of thoughts, feelings, memories, and identity is altered, as is integration of somatic experiences and functions, and patients lose functioning of motor control or sensory awareness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Dissociation may occur as a consequence of fatigue, panic attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], physical injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/25,26,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,43</a>], recognizable diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/24,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,44</a>], iatrogenic triggers such as general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/42,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45</a>], or drug side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In this model, the symptom of paralysis or abnormal movement arises during the dissociated state when the patient is &ldquo;depersonalized&rdquo; and generally loses feelings of ownership over body movements. Attention paid asymmetrically to this experience, combined with fear of what the symptom might represent (eg, stroke), may intensify and cause more &ldquo;localized&rdquo; depersonalization, thus prolonging the symptom. In nonepileptic seizures, prodromal symptoms of panic attacks may become so unbearable that patients respond by losing awareness in an apparent blackout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>], with subsequent nonepileptic seizures occurring as a conditioned response to unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and situations, even in the absence of a prodrome. </p><p>Some cognitive behavioral models hypothesize that conversion disorder is perpetuated by maladaptive thoughts. Evidence for this hypothesis includes findings that recovery can be impeded by thoughts that conversion symptoms are due to a disease process with a known pathologic basis and beliefs that psychological factors are not involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/9,23,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23,49</a>]. In addition, beliefs that symptoms are caused by recognizable disease and are therefore not reversible appear to be a more powerful predictor of poor prognosis than the number of conversion symptoms or severity of disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13156131\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurobiologic model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversion disorder may involve abnormalities in neural networks of grey matter brain regions rather than a disturbance in one specific structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These networks are thought to include frontal (orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex) and subcortical (limbic) structures that may be activated by emotional stress, and in turn provide input to inhibitory basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits that reduce conscious motor or sensory processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, there may be aberrant activity in brain networks that include the inferior parietal <span class=\"nowrap\">lobe/temporoparietal</span> junction and are involved in self-agency, which is the experience that one causes one&rsquo;s own actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. One hypothesis is that overly sensitive amygdala responses to fear (ie, abnormal responses to stimuli, including those that are objectively neutral) lead to changes in networks mediating sensory and motor function. In the setting of abnormal self-directed attention (eg, depersonalization), these changes produce sensations or movements that are associated with an abnormal sense of self control and are interpreted as involuntary symptoms of a disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/6,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38</a>].</p><p>Neuroimaging of patients with conversion disorder has suggested predominantly functional but also possibly structural central nervous system changes. Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies that compared patients with conversion disorder (weakness subtype) to healthy controls have found evidence of altered brain structure in patients (eg, reduced thalamic volume and increased cortical thickness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging of patients with conversion disorder (weakness subtype) and healthy controls during recall of traumatic events shows differences in regional brain activity (eg, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, it is not known if the differences represent etiologic causes, confounding comorbidities, or sequelae of the disorder. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518775656\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychodynamic models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic psychodynamic hypothesis, which gives conversion disorder its name, is that patients experience an unconscious conflict that is converted into a somatic symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/15,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,58,59</a>]. The symptom serves as a defense against anxiety and distress, which are reduced by the conflict remaining unconscious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In this model, the conversion symptom symbolizes the conflict and may help the patient avoid an overwhelming situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The hypothesis is difficult to test scientifically, has been hard to apply clinically, and thus has little empirical support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Subsequent psychodynamic hypotheses emphasize abnormal interpersonal relationships that develop in the context of problematic early relationships (eg, poor parenting) or traumatic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In these models, a new conflict or traumatic event leads to recurrence of previous patterns of abnormal behavior and the development of physical symptoms. The physical symptoms are regarded as a coping response, secondary to emotional dysregulation. As an example, somatic symptoms that lead to contact with clinicians may enable patients to meet dependency needs established earlier in life. Such hypotheses are also hard to test.</p><p>Evidence supporting the psychodynamic model includes a retrospective study that assessed patients with conversion disorder (n = 43) and patients with depression (n = 28) for stressors prior to symptom onset, and asked healthy controls (n = 28) about stressors in the prior two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">stressors/life</span> events were rated for the extent to which symptoms enabled one to escape from an aversive situation or ameliorate the stressor, eg, providing escape from going to work and facing an abusive boss. The incidence of &ldquo;escape&rdquo; life events was greater in the month before symptom onset for patients with conversion disorder, than for patients with depression and healthy controls (53 versus 14 and 0 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13156138\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prognosis for conversion disorder (functional neurologic symptom disorder) is generally poor.

In addition, a median of nine other physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and nausea) were present, psychosocial functioning was poor, and emotional distress was common.</p><p>Among the subtypes of conversion disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>] may have a better prognosis than <span class=\"nowrap\">weakness/paralysis</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], and tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures varies, but is often poor.

Sociodemographic correlates of conversion disorder may include younger age, female sex, and greater disability. Onset of conversion disorder rarely occurs prior to age 10 years. (See <a href=\"#H13156061\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology and pathogenesis of conversion disorder are not known. However, many factors have been identified that may predispose patients to conversion disorder or precipitate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuate symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88079 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13156089\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological factors or life events such as trauma, interpersonal conflicts, and recent or old stressors may be associated with onset of conversion disorder. However, psychological factors are not always reported, nor are they specific to conversion disorder, and many patients with conversion symptoms may not have identifiable psychological factors. (See <a href=\"#H13156103\" class=\"local\">'Premorbid clinical factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-existing psychiatric disorders and functional somatic symptoms may predispose patients to developing conversion disorder. In addition, conversion disorder may be triggered by physical injury and neurologic illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H13156103\" class=\"local\">'Premorbid clinical factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion symptoms may be inadvertently perpetuated by clinicians who fail to give a clear explanation and positive diagnosis of the symptoms, excessively investigate symptoms, prescribe inappropriate drugs and appliances, perform unnecessary operations, and misattribute symptoms to recognizable disease or to irrelevant radiologic or laboratory findings. (See <a href=\"#H13165779\" class=\"local\">'Perpetuating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several hypothetical models attempt to explain how conversion symptoms develop and are not mutually exclusive: &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The psychodynamic hypothesis is that patients experience an unconscious conflict that is converted into a somatic symptom. The symptom is a defense against anxiety and distress, which are reduced by the conflict remaining unconscious. Subsequent psychodynamic hypotheses emphasize abnormal interpersonal relationships that develop in the context of problematic early relationships or traumatic events. (See <a href=\"#H518775656\" class=\"local\">'Psychodynamic models'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cognitive-behavioral models emphasize factors such as processing of perception and behavior outside of awareness, selective attentional bias that amplifies minor physiological stimuli and asymmetries, dissociation, and maladaptive thoughts that perpetuate symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H13156124\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral models'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The neurobiologic model hypothesizes that abnormalities in neural networks of grey matter brain regions involving frontal and subcortical structures are activated by emotional stress, and in turn provide input to inhibitory basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits that reduce conscious motor or sensory processing. Networks involved in the experience that one causes one&rsquo;s own actions also appear important. (See <a href=\"#H13156131\" class=\"local\">'Neurobiologic model'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis for conversion disorder is generally poor. Factors associated with poor outcome include the presence of multiple physical symptoms, long-standing symptoms, poor physical functioning, comorbid personality disorder, beliefs that symptoms are irreversible and caused by a disease with a known pathologic basis, and illness-related financial benefits. Factors associated with a positive outcome in conversion disorder include a good response to initial explanation and treatment, comorbid anxiety or depression, change in marital status, and a good therapeutic alliance with the clinician.
