Anaphylaxis is &quot;a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death,&quot; a definition developed by a consensus of international experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Symptoms typically appear within a few seconds to two hours after food ingestion and are believed to arise from massive mediator release from mast cells and basophils. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>IgE-mediated food-induced anaphylaxis accounts for the vast majority of reactions in older children and adults. The remainder of this topic review refers to IgE-mediated reactions, except where specifically noted.</p><p>Anaphylaxis caused by food exposures other than ingestion, such as physical contact between food and skin or inhalation of aerosolized food proteins, has not been convincingly demonstrated. Inhalation of <span class=\"nowrap\">steam/vapors</span> from cooking food (eg, fish and shellfish) rarely induces anaphylactic reactions. Intimate oral contact with others who have been eating the culprit food is a rare cause of food-allergic reactions. These and other issues in food allergen avoidance are reviewed in detail separately.

If the food is consumed without subsequent exercise or if exercise is performed without associated ingestion of the food, the patient does not develop allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>In most patients, FDEIAn only develops if a certain food, such as wheat, seafood, or nuts, is eaten in association with <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/exertion</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

These symptoms improve once the culprit food is identified and removed from the diet. Reintroduction of the food, however, may precipitate acute vomiting beginning approximately two hours after ingestion, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, lethargy, hypotension or shock, and acidosis. There may be an associated peripheral blood leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, which typically peaks within a few hours of allergen ingestion. Therapy involves fluid resuscitation and supportive care.</p><p>Food protein-induced enterocolitis is reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

Obtaining absolute figures on the prevalence of food-induced anaphylaxis is difficult, however, because there have been no universally accepted diagnostic criteria, presenting symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed, and there are no central reporting agencies in most countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].

In most cases, however, a careful history and attention to the evolution of symptoms should enable the clinician to make the correct diagnosis.</p><p>As an example, a six-year-old boy with a history of asthma presents with wheezing and cough since arriving home from school, although his mother states that he was well that morning and she received no calls from his teacher during the day. He then begins to vomit while receiving nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>. He has never had any problems with albuterol in the past. On closer examination, the boy is flushed and has scattered urticaria on his neck and in his axillae. Further questioning reveals that he shared a candy bar during the bus ride home. The mother then recalls a previous &quot;asthma attack&quot; a few months earlier after he had eaten trail mix, although she did not make a connection between the two events at the time. The evolution of this patient's symptoms should alert the clinician to the correct diagnosis of anaphylaxis, possibly triggered by peanuts or tree nuts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences between children and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants and young children experiencing food-allergic reactions, gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms tend to be most prominent, and shock is less common than in adults.</p><p>The frequency of presenting symptoms in anaphylaxis differs somewhat between children and adults, with children manifesting cardiovascular symptoms less often and respiratory symptoms more often than their adult counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/3,19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,29</a>].

Diagnosis has been hampered by a lack of agreement on the exact criteria that constitute anaphylaxis. To address this problem, the National Institutes of Health and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network convened two symposia of international experts who proposed a definition and a set of three criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These criteria reflect the fact that the pattern of target organ involvement in anaphylaxis is quite variable. These criteria have been validated in a prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The first criterion requires the presence of cutaneous signs or symptoms, in combination with respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular symptoms (or associated end-organ dysfunction due to low blood pressure), or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>). Cutaneous involvement is present in the vast majority of anaphylactic reactions, and the first criterion, therefore, will be used most frequently. However, up to 20 percent of cases lack skin symptoms.</p><p>The second criterion incorporates less obvious symptoms, although it is applied to patients with known food allergy. This criterion requires <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> in two or more of the following categories: cutaneous, respiratory, <span class=\"nowrap\">cardiovascular/hemodynamic,</span> or gastrointestinal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The third criterion is intended to capture uncommon episodes of food-induced anaphylaxis that consist of isolated cardiovascular symptoms. This criterion applies to individuals with known exposure to a food allergen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>). Uncommon cases of food-induced anaphylaxis presenting as isolated hypotension have been reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Isolated cardiovascular symptoms are rare in children, although hypotension may lead to nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypoxia, dizziness, syncope, and seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no reliable laboratory markers of anaphylaxis. Plasma histamine levels may be fleetingly elevated, returning to normal within one hour in most cases. Elevations in serum tryptase, which are sometimes detectable in anaphylaxis caused by non-food triggers, are usually normal in food-allergic reactions, for unclear reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-induced-anaphylaxis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Therefore, the absence of an elevated plasma histamine or serum tryptase level never excludes the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis, a type of non-IgE-mediated allergy, can cause hypotensive reactions in infants and young children. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of food-induced anaphylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any food can cause anaphylaxis in a susceptible individual. In the United States, peanuts and tree nuts are the leading culprits, followed by shellfish (crustaceans and mollusks) and fish.
