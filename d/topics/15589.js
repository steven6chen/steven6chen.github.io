Septic arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint. This infection is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also be caused by other germs. The bacteria get into the joint in different ways. Most often, the bacteria travel to the joint through the blood from another part of the body.</p><p>Septic arthritis sometimes leads to joint damage and long-term joint problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207879\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of septic arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually start suddenly and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm skin around the joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>Septic arthritis usually affects only one joint, but sometimes it affects more than one joint. Joints commonly involved are the knee, wrist, ankle, and hip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207894\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for septic arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests for septic arthritis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of fluid from the joint &ndash; Usually, the doctor can use a needle and syringe to get a sample of fluid. But sometimes the doctor has to do surgery to get a sample of fluid. The fluid sample is sent to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests, called &quot;blood cultures,&quot; to check for bacteria in the blood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An X-ray of the joint</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207909\"><span class=\"h1\">How is septic arthritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for septic arthritis involves both:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines &ndash; These medicines kill the germs that are causing the infection. People usually get these medicines through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Draining the fluid from the joint &ndash; Doctors can drain the fluid in different ways, depending on which joint is involved. Many times, they can use a needle and syringe to drain the fluid. But sometimes they need to do surgery to drain the fluid. If your joint keeps filling up with fluid, you might need to have the fluid drained more than once.</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). The physical therapist can show you exercises to prevent joint problems and keep your joint from getting too stiff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207933\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Joint infection (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
