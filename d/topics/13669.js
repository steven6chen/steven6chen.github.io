While the natal cleft is the most common site of disease, other areas of the body such as the umbilicus and interdigital spaces can be affected. Management is variable and guided by the clinical presentation and extent of disease. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of pilonidal disease are presented here. </p><p>Pilonidal disease, especially when infected, can be confused with other conditions, which are discussed in other topics (see <a href=\"#H12651894\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-and-perirectal-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal and perirectal abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12652900\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natal cleft, also called the gluteal cleft, is the groove between the buttocks that extends from just below the sacrum to the perineum, superior to the anus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87098 \">figure 1</a>). The cleft or sulcus occurs as a result of the anchoring of the deep layers of the skin overlying the coccyx to the anococcygeal raphe. The cleft forms the border between the gluteus maximus muscles, which obscure the cleft when a person is upright (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87078 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12651838\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of pilonidal disease is approximately 26 per 100,000 population, with a mean age at presentation of 19 years for women and 21 years for men, with men being affected two to four times more often than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Although pilonidal disease is less frequent in children and adults older than 45 years, it is still encountered in surgical practice in those age groups. Patient presentations are equally divided between acute and chronic disease; few patients present with asymptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929693575\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for pilonidal disease include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Overweight/obesity</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local trauma or irritation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedentary lifestyle or prolonged sitting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep natal cleft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased hair density in the natal cleft region</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history</p><p/><p>Although these are typical risk factors, often none are present in patients with pilonidal disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12648624\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pilonidal disease was originally thought to be congenital due to abnormal skin in the gluteal cleft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the contemporary theory considers it acquired rather than congenital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. The tendency of pilonidal disease to recur following an extensive surgical resection supports that theory. </p><p>The occasional occurrence of pilonidal cysts in locations other than the natal cleft (eg, umbilicus, scalp, interdigital spaces, and between breasts) also supports the acquired theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. Others have reported pilonidal sinus occurring in locations that would be subject to local trauma from hair, such as on the hands of barbers, sheep shearers, and dog groomers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12655713\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific mechanism for the development of pilonidal disease is unclear, although the presence of hair and inflammation in the natal cleft are contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>]. As a person sits or bends, the natal cleft stretches, damaging or breaking hair follicles and opening a pore or &quot;pit.&quot; The pores collect debris and serve as a fertile environment for hairs shed from the head, back, or buttocks to lodge and become embedded. As the skin is drawn taut over the natal cleft with movement, negative pressure is created in the subcutaneous space, drawing hairs deeper into the pore, and the friction causes the hairs to form a sinus. </p><p>Typically, pilonidal sinus tracts extend cephalad, which is likely related to the mechanical forces involved as the direction of the follicle determines the direction of the sinus tract; however, they can also extend laterally or inferiorly and may resemble anal fistula disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>] (see <a href=\"#H12651894\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Cavities may contain hair, debris, and granulation tissue, but hair follicles are rarely identified on histopathologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pilonidal cavities are not true cysts and lack a fully epithelialized lining; however, the sinus tracts may be epithelialized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87075 \">figure 3</a>). Foreign body giant cell reaction is typically associated with local cellular infiltrate.</p><p>Once the sinus becomes infected secondarily, an acute subcutaneous abscess develops, spreads along the tract, and may rupture spontaneously, discharging its contents through the skin cephalad or lateral to the natal cleft, or it may require operative drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87098 \">figure 1</a>). A recurring or chronic infection can also develop in the affected area due to retained hair or infected residue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12648631\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12651854\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient presentation is highly variable, ranging from an asymptomatic pilonidal cavity or sinus to acute infection or chronic inflammation and drainage associated with an open wound of varying size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2909104940\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of an acute exacerbation include sudden onset of mild-to-severe pain in the intergluteal region while sitting or performing activities that stretch the skin overlying the natal cleft (eg, bending, sit-ups). The patient may also report intermittent swelling as well as mucoid, purulent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody drainage in the area. Fever and malaise are generally associated with an undrained abscess. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3401379567\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pilonidal disease experience recurrent or persistent drainage and pain. They may identify one or more areas of drainage (sinus tracts). There have been occasional case reports of squamous cell carcinomas arising in long-standing, neglected pilonidal sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Disease presenting with an unusual or aggressive appearance should be evaluated with a biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12651862\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pilonidal disease is identified by retracting the buttock cheeks enough to visualize the pores or sinuses within the valley of the natal cleft; additional findings may be present depending on the acuity of presentation: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients, the physical examination reveals one or more primary pores (pits) in the midline of the natal cleft <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a painless sinus opening cephalad and slightly lateral to the cleft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87098 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute exacerbation, the examination often reveals cellulitis in the natal cleft and a tender, fluctuant mass in or near the top of the natal cleft, usually slightly lateral to one side, indicating the presence of an abscess. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with chronic disease, one or more sinus openings draining mucoid, purulent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody fluid can be identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F117059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117059 \">picture 1</a>). A hair may occasionally be seen protruding from a sinus opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Secondary tracts or pits can be identified lateral to the midline in patients with complex disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12648638\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic pilonidal disease is diagnosed clinically based upon findings of characteristic midline pores (pits) in the natal cleft region. Acute and chronic pilonidal disease can be diagnosed by additional findings of a tender mass and one or more sinus openings draining mucoid, purulent, or bloody fluid, respectively. The diagnosis is clinical; imaging or laboratory studies are not necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12651894\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differentiating pilonidal disease from an alternative or concurrent disease often requires a thorough anorectal examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perianal abscess</strong> &ndash; A perianal abscess often presents with severe pain in the anal or rectal area, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67524 \">picture 2</a>). On physical examination, an area of fluctuance or a patch of erythematous, indurated skin overlying the perianal skin may be noted. While perirectal abscesses are generally near the anus, pilonidal abscesses are located more cephalad in the natal cleft area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87098 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-and-perirectal-abscess#H620962517\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal and perirectal abscess&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anorectal fistula</strong> &ndash; An anorectal fistula is the chronic manifestation of an anorectal abscess. When the abscess ruptures or is drained, an epithelialized tract can form to connect the abscess in the anus or rectum with the perirectal skin. The diagnosis of a fistula is primarily based upon characteristic findings on history and physical examination: pain, purulent drainage, and a perirectal skin lesion. While anorectal fistulas track toward the anus, pilonidal sinuses track toward the cavity in the midline of the natal cleft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F117057\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117057 \">picture 3</a>).

In particular, anal fissures may be asymptomatic or present with bleeding, deep ulceration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80569 \">picture 4</a>), or anal pain, which may be worsened during evacuation. Symptoms can vary from anal pain and purulent discharge to bleeding and incontinence. The area involved with perianal Crohn disease is generally centered around the anus, rather than the natal cleft area.

A furuncle is an infection of the hair follicle in which purulent material extends through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where a small abscess forms. A carbuncle is a coalescence of several inflamed follicles into a single inflammatory mass with purulent drainage from multiple follicles. Furuncles and carbuncles commonly involve the buttocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70089 \">picture 6</a>). These lesions are typically away from the midline and not associated with a sinus tract.

Folliculitis manifests as clusters of multiple small, raised, pruritic, erythematous lesions less than 5 mm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72586\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72586 \">picture 7</a>). Pustules may be present at the centers of the lesions. Folliculitis may present with sharply demarcated areas in the setting of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> infection, reflecting exposure to areas of the skin in contact with contaminated water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65119\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65119 \">picture 8</a>). <em>P. aeruginosa</em> folliculitis may also manifest with larger lesions, up to 30 mm in diameter. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hidradenitis suppurativa</strong> &ndash; Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic follicular occlusive disease involving the intertriginous skin of the axillary, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69605\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69605 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52570 \">picture 10</a>). Hidradenitis suppurativa can occur in the perirectal area and present with purulent drainage. Hidradenitis suppurativa has some characteristics in common with pilonidal disease (eg, sinus tracts, sores), and some have postulated a <span class=\"nowrap\">relationship/common</span> etiology between hidradenitis suppurativa and pilonidal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, hidradenitis is usually easily distinguished by its typical location in the perineal or inguinal area, rather than the natal cleft area.

In a retrospective review of 26 patients with an incidental pilonidal sinus undergoing an excision and primary closure, the rate of healing following excision and primary closure was only 62 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Because of the morbidity associated with most procedures performed to address pilonidal disease, surgery should be discouraged in the asymptomatic patient.</p><p>Although gluteal cleft hair has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pilonidal disease, it is not known whether gluteal cleft hair removal is beneficial to completely asymptomatic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1722101549\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute pilonidal abscess should be managed with prompt incision and drainage at the time of presentation.

In a randomized trial, unroofing and curettage of the abscess cavity resulted in superior healing (96 versus 79 percent) and fewer recurrences (10 versus 54 percent) compared with drainage alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Wounds are packed with gauze, and healing occurs by secondary intention in the acute setting. Curettage of the pilonidal sinus and tract or excision of midline pores has no clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and is not typically performed in the clinical setting of an acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2146228959\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of antibiotics is generally limited to the clinical setting of cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Antibiotic use should be reserved for those with cellulitis in the absence of abscess, and for those with significant cellulitis after surgical drainage. </p><p>There are no definitive data to support antibiotic therapy in the management of the patient with an acute abscess or chronic pilonidal disease without cellulitis. A systemic review that included 25 randomized trials found a small postoperative healing benefit when perioperative antibiotics were given, but the magnitude of the benefit was modest, the sample sizes were small, and many studies had methodologic limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>However, patients with underlying immunosuppression, high risk for endocarditis, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), or concurrent systemic illness should be considered for ancillary antimicrobial prophylaxis in conjunction with surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis in high-risk clinical settings is reviewed separately.

Nonoperative strategies, including perineal hygiene, cleft hair control by either regular shaving or another method of epilation (eg, laser, depilatory cream [eg, Nair]), and observation for signs of an infection such as acute pain and drainage are optimal in this clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. In a retrospective study, meticulous hair control by natal cleft shaving, along with perineal hygiene and limited lateral drainage for abscesses, was credited with reducing hospital stay and total surgical operations compared with surgical alternatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. By contrast, there is evidence that razor hair-shaving may increase the risk of recurrence following definitive surgery for pilonidal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pilonidal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3095276756\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic or recurrent disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pilonidal disease presents with either recurrent abscesses with intervening periods of healing, or one or more persistently draining sinuses that may be associated with a significant nonhealing wound.

It is most commonly seen in patients in their late teens and early twenties with a male predominance. It is less frequently seen in children and in those older than 45 years. (See <a href=\"#H12648617\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12652900\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12651838\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pilonidal disease is an acquired condition likely related to the mechanical forces on the skin overlying the natal cleft damaging or breaking hair follicles and opening pores that collect loose hairs and debris. Subsequent infection of the pores leads to abscess <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> draining sinus formation and symptoms. Risk factors include obesity, deep natal cleft, prolonged sitting, local trauma, and family history. (See <a href=\"#H929693575\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12648624\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12655713\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from an asymptomatic pilonidal sinus to an acute infection or chronic exacerbation with inflammation and drainage. The physical findings include one or more primary pores (pits) in the midline of the natal cleft with or without a painless sinus opening(s) cephalad and slightly lateral to one side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87098 \">figure 1</a>). For patients with acute or chronic disease, a tender mass or sinus draining mucoid, purulent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody fluid can be identified. Diagnosis is clinical without the need for laboratory or imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H12648631\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12648638\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have a pilonidal sinus but have never experienced an acute flare do not require surgery.

The wound should be debrided of all visible hair and inflammatory debris. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with cellulitis in the absence of abscess, and for those with significant cellulitis after surgical drainage. Additionally, patients with underlying immunosuppression, high risk for endocarditis, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), or concurrent systemic illness may require antibiotics in conjunction with surgical drainage.

By contrast, there is evidence that razor hair-shaving may increase the risk of recurrence following definitive surgery for pilonidal disease, and it is not known whether gluteal cleft hair removal is beneficial to completely asymptomatic patients.
