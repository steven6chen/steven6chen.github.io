Although by definition even a single episode of awakening to urinate is nocturia, epidemiological evidence and expert clinical opinion both suggest nocturia is likely clinically meaningful if a patient voids two or more times nightly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients themselves are more likely to consult a provider about nocturia if they have three or more episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. New-onset adult nocturnal urinary incontinence or nighttime bed-wetting (enuresis) is rare and distinct from nocturia and likely requires a different approach focusing on sleep problems or urinary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Nocturia is a source of significant bother for some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nocturia is one of the most distressing symptoms in older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and is the lower urinary tract symptom most strongly associated with poor quality of life ratings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients report nocturia as a leading cause of sleep disturbance, affecting both sleep onset and maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nocturia is associated with increased rates of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], work absenteeism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], lower self-rated physical and mental health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and increased all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the very old, nocturia is associated with higher rates of accidental falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] and fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Because nocturia is associated with a variety of clinical syndromes and disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], the diagnostic approach is often challenging, and treatment may result in only small improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of nocturia in adults. Detailed discussions of some conditions that cause or are associated with nocturia are presented separately.

Occasional nocturia is present in 50 percent of men and women aged 50 to 59 years. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, more women than men have nocturia; the sex ratio reverses after 60 years of age, with prevalence greater in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The prevalence of twice nightly or greater nocturia among men between 70 and 79 is nearly 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Many women with nocturia also have other urinary tract symptoms (eg, overactive bladder syndrome or polyuria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, isolated nocturia without daytime voiding symptoms is also possible. In a cross-sectional study of over 2000 women aged 40 or older, 40 percent of women who had nocturia had no other urinary tract symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While pregnant women commonly have nocturia, it nearly always resolves by three months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most studies indicate that the prevalence of nocturia is higher in non-Hispanic black men and women, with Hispanic men and women having an intermediate prevalence compared with non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/27,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29-32</a>]. Higher rates of nocturia in black men and women do not appear to be due to socioeconomic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>In a group of men aged 50 to 70 followed longitudinally, the risk for developing nocturia was highest in 70-year-olds and lowest for the 50-year-olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Every year, approximately 10 percent more men started to void during the night. Also, older men were much less likely to have a remission of their nocturia when compared with the younger men. Fluctuations in the symptom make it difficult to provide a reliable incident rate.</p><p>Risk factors for nocturia include obesity, hypertension, diuretic usage, snoring, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, antidepressant usage, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/12,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,34,35</a>]. Physical activity has been associated with decreased nocturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although nocturia has been associated with increased mortality (15-year survival rates of 76.5 and 84.8 percent for individuals with and without nocturia, respectively), this association is not confirmed by multivariate analysis correcting for hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac symptoms, smoking, and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may initiate a discussion of their sleep being interrupted by nighttime voiding, or the clinician might learn of nocturia during a review of symptoms. Clinicians should specifically question about &quot;waking at night to urinate&quot; (or &quot;to pee,&quot; &quot;to void,&quot; or &quot;to make water&quot;) since nearly one-half of patients do not correctly interpret the term &quot;nocturia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Occasionally, nocturia can be an indicator of worsening clinical status of an underlying disease, such as chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], diabetes mellitus, or congestive heart failure. The most important reason to diagnose nocturia, however, is to address symptoms and minimize its negative impact on quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Nocturia is insidious in its onset. Few patients present with an abrupt onset of three to four episodes of nocturia nightly; most individuals describe progressing from having an episode occasionally to having one or more episodes nightly. Additionally, nocturia has a varied night-to-night occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The number of episodes of nocturia that are reported by a given individual over time fluctuate significantly as well. In a study that looked at the reported frequency of nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms who were receiving placebo as part of a randomized trial, nocturia regression varied between 2 and 33 percent, while nocturia progression varied between 8 and 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. For some patients, this unpredictability represents another loss of control in the process of aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and makes it difficult to predict how much sleep a patient can expect in any given night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>It is more valuable to quantify and understand how much distress nocturia causes the patient than to focus on obtaining a precise count of nightly episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. While frequency of episodes and &quot;bother&quot; from nocturia are linked, one study of men with BPH found that the number of nightly nocturia episodes explained only 25 percent of the variance in reported bother. Other factors, such as difficulty returning to sleep following nighttime awakening, and degree of morning fatigue, contribute to the impact of nocturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nocturia can be attributed to any disorder or condition that causes one of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67664 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-volume bladder void</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased volume of nighttime urinary output</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbance</p><p/><p>A longitudinal study of 1688 men aged 50 to 78 years found the following factors associated with an increased prevalence of nocturia: age, maximum voided volume, 24-hour polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, and lower urinary tract symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a study of 41 male patients (mean age 72.5 years) with two or more nocturnal micturitions, the following etiologies were found: nocturnal polyuria 83 percent; low bladder volume capacity 58 percent; bladder outlet obstruction 44 percent; sleep apnea 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A study of 845 patients with symptoms of overactive bladder and nocturia found that younger patients (&lt;50 years) were more likely to have low bladder capacity, and older patients (&gt;70 years) more likely to have increased nocturnal urine output, based on data from a seven-day voiding diary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>For many patients with nocturia, it is likely that multiple conditions coexist and lead to symptoms. As an example, a study of 55 patients evaluating comorbid illness found that male patients (mean age 67 years) had an average of 4.5 medical conditions likely to be related to nocturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-volume bladder voids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-volume voids may be due to either reduced bladder capacity or impaired bladder function. The two most common causes of low-volume bladder voids are an overactive bladder and bladder outlet obstruction, often related to benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).</p><p>Increased age has been associated with reduced bladder volume; it is unclear if this is due to age-related changes in the bladder or to the high prevalence of detrusor hyperactivity in the older population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Since so many older adults have detrusor hyperactivity, it often appears that aging is associated with small-volume voids (since this is a result from detrusor hyperactivity). When the separate effects of age and bladder pathophysiology are carefully teased apart, older women without detrusor hyperactivity appear to have normal bladder capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Increased age is also associated with increased prevalence of BPH.

Overproduction of urine at night, with a normal 24-hour urine output, is called nocturnal polyuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The definition of nocturnal polyuria is age-dependent, and for older adults (&gt;65 years) has been defined as nocturnal urine volume greater than 33 percent of the 24-hour urine volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role of arginine vasopressin &ndash; Nocturnal polyuria may be due to age-related changes in the secretion and action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. AVP, a peptide hormone secreted by the neurohypophyseal system, is released when plasma osmolality is increased or blood pressure decreased (as seen with orthostasis, vasodilation, or significant blood loss). AVP targets receptors in the renal distal tubules which control urine concentration. There is a diurnal periodicity in AVP release in young, healthy subjects, with higher AVP plasma levels in the evening contributing to decreased nighttime urine output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diurnal variation in AVP release is absent in many older subjects. A study of 69 healthy subjects whose plasma AVP and osmolality were monitored every four hours found that older subjects who maintained a normal diurnal pattern in AVP had no episodes of nocturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Another study compared diurnal AVP variation in 17 men referred for nocturia believed to be related to BPH with 10 men with no nocturia symptoms; 11 of the 17 men with nocturia exhibited absent diurnal variation in AVP, compared with 0 of 10 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solute diuresis &ndash; Dietary solutes (principally urea, sodium, and potassium) are excreted soon after a meal; decreased solute excretion at night is another factor accounting for relatively low nocturnal urine output in healthy adults.

OSA should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with nocturia, and the close association between the conditions has led to a suggestion that nocturia should be a screening question for OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Sleep disorders have been demonstrated to be a frequent cause of nocturia in men younger than 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and in women with symptoms of daytime overactive bladder syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Primary sleep disorders may result in nocturia either because of hormonal changes related to sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], or due to patient misperception of the reason for awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In a study in a sleep clinic population where participants were monitored with overnight polysomnography, of participants who identified &quot;needing to void&quot; as the reason they awoke, the polysomnographic record showed that an apneic episode, snoring, or restless leg movement immediately preceded the awakening in 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>OSA may also cause nocturnal polyuria by release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) due to negative intrathoracic pressure and stretching of the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. ANP release causes vasodilation and inhibits aldosterone, resulting in increased sodium and water excretion.

A 24-hour recording of void time and void amount, along with times of going to bed and awakenings, can be extremely helpful in patients who have not adequately responded to initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], although patients may find this difficult to perform properly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Such a record can help determine whether nocturia is due to low-volume voiding at night, increased nocturnal polyuria, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The record provides useful diagnostic and therapeutic clues, including the maximal voided volume (a measure of functional bladder capacity) and modal voided volume, and can identify patients with high-volume fluid intake (&ge;3 liters) who did not report this in their history. A sample log is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64573\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef64573 \">form 1</a>).</p><p>Interpretation of these records requires understanding some conventions. Nocturia episodes are voids that occur between going to bed and rising in the morning. The first morning void is not counted as a nocturia episode. Nighttime urine output includes any volume produced after bedtime, so this calculation does include the first morning void. Thus, if the nocturnal urine output (amount voided during hours of sleep plus the first morning void) is 1200 mL and the modal voided volume is 300 mL, then the patient probably has three episodes of nocturia (1200 &divide; 300 = 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The fourth void takes place as the first morning void and is not counted as nocturia.</p><p>If the nighttime urine volume (1200 mL in this example, including the first morning void) divided by the 24-hour urine volume is greater than 35 percent, the patient has nocturnal polyuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Older individuals with nocturia, compared with older individuals without nocturia, have smaller average volume voids and a greater percentage of their urine output is excreted at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>If the voiding record shows that the 24-hour urine output is higher than expected, it is important to confirm fluid intake. A log of the patient's complete fluid intake may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with neurologic conditions affecting the bladder (including diabetic neuropathy), older men, and those with a history of genitourinary surgery are at increased risk for urinary retention. Post-void residual (PVR) testing by catheterization or ultrasound can be helpful in patients who might have bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) or urinary retention. Patients found to have suprapubic distention or fullness on physical examination should be further assessed by ultrasound or office in-and-out catheterization to determine if there is an elevated PVR.</p><p>While parameters for interpreting the PVR results are neither standardized nor well-tested, the results might lead one away from prescribing a bladder relaxant medication in patients with an increased PVR. In general, a PVR of less than 50 mL is considered adequate emptying, and a PVR greater than 200 mL may require referral for further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Although measurements of urinary peak flow rate, as well as PVR, are included in all clinical trials of nocturia involving male subjects, there is no definitive evidence stating that results from these tests are necessary. Men with low flow rates may report urinary intermittency or a long duration of voiding. Urine peak flow can be readily measured with a flow meter. Classically, a peak flow rate greater than or equal to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> (for a voided volume of at least 150 mL) makes BOO much less likely. A low flow rate may be due to either obstruction or detrusor underactivity. In population-based studies, urine flow rates were significantly slower among men with symptoms compared with those without symptoms; however, significant overlap exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Additionally, it is not clear whether men with a lower flow rate treated with BPH medications have greater nocturia reductions than do men with higher flow rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal function, electrolytes, and serum glucose should be measured. A urinalysis should be performed in all patients, with urine culture if an infection is suspected. In older women, the interpretation of the urine culture must take into account the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is not a cause of either incontinence or morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine cytology or cystoscopy are indicated only if hematuria or pelvic pain is present. Patients with undiagnosed prostate cancer are not more likely to have urinary symptoms. Nonetheless, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is reasonable in the evaluation of men with nocturia and other lower urinary symptoms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>). The Medical Treatment of Prostate Symptoms study showed that only patients with higher PSA values (&gt;1.4) are likely to benefit from 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING TREATMENT OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used measure of nocturia treatment efficacy is a reduction in nocturia episodes.

It is important to recognize that most treatments show only a small reduction in episodes of nocturia, ranging from 0 to 0.8 fewer episodes of nocturia versus placebo.</p><p>An additional important target for therapy is the reduction in bother due to nocturia.

Trials of fluid modification and caffeine reduction in women with incontinence have shown decreases in total 24-hour urinary frequency, but not specifically in nocturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

In addition to participant difficulty in complying with the recommended changes in fluid intake, reducing fluid by 50 percent resulted in a statistically insignificant increase in nocturia episodes (1.4 to 1.8), and increasing fluids by 25 or 50 percent had no effect on nocturia. Using fluid management as a part of an overall multicomponent management strategy may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].</p><p>Optimizing treatment for underlying conditions, such as diabetes or congestive heart failure, is important but has not directly been shown to reduce rates of nocturia. Patients needing twice-daily diuretic medications may be helped by moving the nighttime diuretic dose to the mid-afternoon. Treatment of peripheral edema by compression stockings or afternoon elevation of the legs has been shown to be useful as part of a multicomponent intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>Treatments aimed at minimizing the bother from nocturia may be helpful, even if there is no effect on the nocturia itself.

Although nocturnal polyuria is a common cause of nocturia in older adults, we avoid the use of ddAVP in patients &gt;65 years because of the high risk of hyponatremia and the availability of safer alternative medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4196322269\"><span class=\"h3\">Physiologic action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of nocturnal polyuria, which is an important cause of nocturia, has been linked to either inadequate nighttime levels of AVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>] or inadequate diurnal variation of AVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. ddAVP is a neuropeptide differing from endogenous vasopressin by a two-amino acid substitution, which gives the compound potent antidiuretic effect but no vasopressor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. ddAVP, taken two hours prior to bedtime, reduces nighttime urine production via increase in urine osmolality and resultant decrease in urine volume. While ddAVP reduces nighttime free-water excretion to provide an opportunity for adequate sleep free from voiding, its use is associated with a compensatory daytime free-water diuresis and potentially increased daytime frequency that could be bothersome to some.

Oral ddAVP is available in 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg doses.

The initial oral dose for nocturia is 0.1 mg, although some experts suggest a 0.05 mg starting dose. Oral ddAVP should not be taken with meals, in order to maximize absorption, and should be started at the lowest possible dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/128-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-130</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An orally disintegrating tablet formulation of ddAVP, which is not available in the United States, has been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturia-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-management-in-adults/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].

It may be more beneficial to try to reduce the bother caused by the nocturia than to target a specific reduction in nocturia episodes. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers must be alert to reports of nocturia and inquire about nocturia if a patient has sleep difficulties.

Age, benign prostatic hyperplasia, congestive heart failure, renal disease, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus are some of the conditions associated with nocturia. Many patients have multiple etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturia is associated with normal physiologic changes in pregnancy; while bothersome, these will resolve following childbirth and do not require treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for nocturia should focus on patterns of fluid intake, other urinary symptoms, and a comprehensive physical examination. Fall risk at night should be considered. A basic chemistry profile including serum glucose should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A frequency-volume chart (ie, a voiding diary) may be helpful in determining the type of nocturia. Nocturnal polyuria is defined as the excretion of &ge;35 percent of the 24-hour urine output during the hours of sleep. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Frequency-volume chart'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial measures should include adjustments in timing of fluid intake and eliminating nighttime diuretic use if present. Pelvic floor exercises and a urinal or commode near the bed may be helpful.

These patients must be able to recognize and report subtle changes in fluid and weight status and be willing to have sodium levels monitored closely. ddAVP has the potential to cause severe hyponatremia and should not be prescribed for most older adults (over the age of 65) and is considered a potentially inappropriate medication.
