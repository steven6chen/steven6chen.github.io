Clinician familiarity with the gynecologic evaluation can help reduce anxiety for both patients and healthcare professionals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The gynecologic history and physical examination in adult women are reviewed here. The initial assessment of pregnant women, evaluation of breast complaints, general approaches to patient interviewing as well as pelvic examination in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual women vary tremendously in their knowledge of, and comfort with, their own bodies. While some may be quite open in disclosing their sexual, reproductive, and genital concerns, others will find such discussions embarrassing or socially inappropriate. Thus, it is essential that providers maintain a sensitive and nonjudgmental approach during this encounter.</p><p>The history should be obtained in a relaxed and private setting, before the patient is asked to disrobe. She should be interviewed alone under most circumstances, unless there is a hearing or language barrier. Questioning should proceed from very straightforward, objective information to more delicate issues. The provider should evaluate and respond to the patient's comfort level and make every effort to remain supportive. </p><p>It is particularly important to avoid making assumptions about a woman's background; as an example, that she is sexually active or is heterosexual.</p><p>One should begin the history with an open-ended question that will elicit the woman's gynecologic concerns. She should be encouraged to describe the situation in her own words and without frequent interruptions. Maintaining eye contact, nodding, and brief clarification of important points convey the provider's attention to the woman's issues. The provider can then ask questions to proceed with the evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-patient-centered-view-of-the-clinician-patient-relationship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A patient-centered view of the clinician-patient relationship&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic components of the gynecologic history are the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61980\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61980 \">table 1</a>) &ndash; the shorthand for menstrual history is age at menarche x cycle length x number of days of bleeding (eg, 13x28x5)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetric history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51970\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51970 \">table 2</a>) &ndash; the shorthand for obstetric history is gravida (number of pregnancies) para (number of term births; number of births from 20 to &lt;37 weeks of gestation; number of failed or terminated pregnancies at &lt;20 weeks; living children) (eg, G2P2112)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual history (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sexual function'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of contraception, past and current (if appropriate)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current symptoms or history of pelvic, vaginal, or vulvar infections &ndash; vaginal discharge, vulvar or vaginal lesions, fever, pelvic pain, abnormal genital tract bleeding, prior sexually transmitted infections or pelvic inflammatory disease (diagnosis, frequency, and treatment) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical cytology (Pap test) history &ndash; date and result of last test; diagnosis and follow-up of abnormal Pap smears</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of other gynecologic problems, such as ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, infertility, endometriosis, or polycystic ovarian syndrome - mode of diagnosis and treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse or urinary or anal incontinence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of gynecologic procedures (eg, endometrial biopsy, laparoscopy, hysterectomy) &ndash; date, indication, complications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for intimate partner violence (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Specific questions are essential in order to obtain accurate information. As an example, some patients may not include miscarriages or abortions when asked about past pregnancies; therefore, the provider should specifically inquire about these events. Some patients will equate undergoing a pelvic examination with having a Pap test, and erroneously state that this test was recently performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other patients may make inaccurate assumptions about whether their ovaries or cervix were removed with a hysterectomy. Therefore, written records of cervical cytology testing results, operative procedures, and pathology results should be obtained whenever possible.</p><p>A comprehensive gynecologic history includes a complete summary of the woman's medical, surgical, social, and family history. A review of symptoms is taken that focuses on the genitourinary areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74722 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Problem focused history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common gynecologic concerns relate to vaginal discharge, abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, urinary problems, sexual dysfunction, and infertility. When a patient identifies one of these issues, detailed questioning can guide further evaluation and diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many reproductive age women have daily vaginal discharge. Normal vaginal discharge is composed of mucoid endocervical secretions in combination with desquamated vaginal wall epithelium and normal bacteria. Physiologic discharge is typically clear, white, or light yellow in color. The volume of discharge varies considerably among women and timing in the menstrual cycle. For women who present with vaginal discharge, questions should be asked regarding the onset, duration, frequency, color, consistency, volume, and odor of the flow. Discharge that is malodorous, pruritic, copious, purulent, bloody, or accompanied by fever requires investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Abnormal genital tract bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women commonly present with a complaint of &ldquo;vaginal bleeding.&rdquo; A complaint of vaginal bleeding most often represents uterine bleeding, but the source may be any part of the genital tract, or the urinary or gastrointestinal tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527 \">table 4</a>). Pregnancy should be excluded in any woman of reproductive age with abnormal genital tract bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pertinent data are the onset of a change in bleeding, amount, duration, and frequency of bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69390 \">table 5</a>). In women of reproductive age or in the menopausal transition, the use of a menstrual chart to document bleeding patterns is helpful in determining whether the changes are sufficiently abnormal to justify investigation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76376 \">figure 1</a>). Irregular bleeding occurs commonly during the menopausal transition and may be a symptom of serious underlying pathology.</p><p>Uterine bleeding is abnormal when it is associated with a change in the woman's normal menstrual pattern or it occurs after menopause. The average menstrual cycle lasts up to seven days and the amount of menstrual blood loss is 35 to 40 mL per cycle, but the range is wide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Menorrhagia is defined as menstrual blood loss greater than 80 mL. However, the term menorrhagia is applied variably to ovulatory or anovulatory uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Prolonged menses are defined as longer than seven days. Given the difficulty in quantifying actual blood loss, questions should focus on a significant change from baseline, bleeding at abnormal times during the cycle (intermenstrual or postcoital), and symptoms of anemia (such as new significant fatigue, orthostasis, or palpitations). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Menopause is defined by 12 months of amenorrhea after the final menstrual period. Postmenopausal bleeding refers to any uterine bleeding in a menopausal woman (other than the expected cyclic bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential postmenopausal hormone therapy). While menopause may occur in some women in their 40s, other causes of amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding should be considered, particularly for patients in their early 40s. While a change in the menstrual pattern is expected in the months or years prior to menopause, an increase in the amount or duration of bleeding during this time should be treated as pathologic and evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characterization of pelvic pain should include the time of onset, duration, location, quality, and severity. The relationship of the pain to menstruation, physical activity, or sexual activity and alleviation of the pain with analgesics, hormonal contraceptives, or position change are useful components of the pain history. Associated gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms could point to a nongynecologic source of the pain. However, ovarian torsion is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary incontinence occurs among women of all ages and requires evaluation when the involuntary loss of urine is bothersome. Historical factors, such as leakage of urine with physical activity (exercise, lifting, coughing, sneezing) versus an overwhelming urge to void with leakage of urine before reaching a toilet, can help to differentiate stress incontinence from detrusor instability. A careful voiding and intake history will help the clinician determine the underlying cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with pelvic organ prolapse may complain of a vaginal bulge, vaginal pressure, or the need to place a finger in the vagina to void or defecate. Such symptoms should be evaluated further with physical examination. It is important to ask about urinary and fecal incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction when evaluating prolapse symptoms and making treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H21524755\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many sexual problems result from <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause reproductive dysfunction and gynecologic problems. Sexual issues include prevention of sexually transmitted infections, contraception, sexual dysfunction, and prevention and management of sexual assault. </p><p>Many women are reluctant to express concerns regarding these matters, but welcome the opportunity to discuss them when approached in an interested and compassionate manner. The importance of an assessment of sexual function was demonstrated in a questionnaire study of over 1000 women seen for a primary care visit; 98 percent reported one or more sexual concerns, but only 18 percent of clinicians asked about sexual health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Women who discussed their sexual concerns with their clinician found the discussion helpful. In another study, among 3000 women with a sexual problem that caused personal distress, only 6 percent of those who sought medical advice scheduled a visit specifically for a sexual problem, and about 80 percent of the time, the woman, rather than the physician, initiated the conversation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In addition to questions regarding basic gynecologic health, contraception and safe sex practices, all women should be asked an open-ended question, such as: do you have any sexual concerns? This question also provides an opportunity to discuss sexual issues and pertinent sexual history.</p><p>A brief set of screening questions is adequate to determine whether a problem exists that requires further inquiry:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have sexual concerns?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you currently having or have you ever had sexual relations?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If not, when did you last engage in sexual activity?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If so, with men or women or both? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you recently had any new partners or sexual contacts?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you protect yourself from pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Would you like to be screened for sexually transmitted infections?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you need contraception or preconceptional counseling?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you currently experiencing or have you experienced previous sexual abuse?</p><p/><p>The patient&rsquo;s answers to these questions will guide the subsequent discussion and help the clinician provide care regarding safe sex, contraception, sexual dysfunction, or sexual abuse or assault.

Infertility is defined as failure of a couple to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse without use of contraception in women less than 35 years of age, and after six months of regular intercourse without use of contraception in women 35 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Before proceeding with an infertility evaluation, the provider should confirm that the couple is having regular, frequent intercourse during the middle of the menstrual cycle. Once the diagnosis is established, the infertility history should focus on three factors: ovulation, tubal and uterine problems, and male factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53077 \">table 6</a>).

The scope of the examination in adolescents depends upon the individual needs of the patient. A reproductive health visit may be limited to age-appropriate education regarding reproductive health matters. A pelvic examination is not included unless indicated due to symptoms or specific patient concerns. </p><p>Prior to a first pelvic examination, the components and benefits of the examination should be explained. Every effort should be made to communicate with and reassure the patient, and the exam should be stopped if the patient is too anxious or uncomfortable. Education regarding the pelvic examination includes potential testing for sexually transmitted infections and cervical cancer screening. Many women erroneously equate a speculum examination with a Pap test, and may incorrectly think that they have been screened for cervical cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6245405\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and frequency for examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, an annual pelvic examination combined with a Pap test, often with screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), has been standard practice in all adult women. In current practice, the goals and outcomes of an annual or periodic pelvic examination in asymptomatic women have been questioned and professional society guidelines differ regarding indications and frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>There is consensus about the following indications for pelvic examination in nonpregnant women age 21 years or older:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To evaluate gynecologic symptoms or concerns</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic women:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To perform a Pap test.

General physical examinations are no longer performed annually for most patients. Regarding pelvic examinations, cervical cancer screening guidelines have changed, and many women require screening only every three to five years. Some methods of screening for genital gonorrheal or chlamydial infection do not require a pelvic examination.

For such patients, the examination may be nearly unbearable, and may deter the patient from seeking appropriate healthcare. Such anxiety may manifest as tense and withdrawn body language, extreme discomfort with the examination, or refusal to have an examination at all.</p><p>It is widely recognized that a pelvic examination may be uncomfortable. In its summary of studies reporting on over 4000 women, the American College of Physicians reported that approximately 35 percent may experience pain, discomfort, fear, embarrassment, or anxiety during a pelvic exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one study, approximately 1000 women in a variety of clinical settings were asked to explain the parts of the examination that were uncomfortable, the reasons for the discomfort, and to suggest ways the provider could have improved the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Physical discomfort (37 percent), embarrassment (20 percent), disliking the attitude of the examiner (7 percent), and experiencing problems during a previous examination (5 percent) were the major concerns reported. Techniques suggested to improve the examination process included explaining each step of the examination in advance, providing more information about the reproductive organs, warming the instruments, and increased gentleness. Other surveys have recommended that providers make an effort to maintain eye contact during the examination and give the patient choices where possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>At first recognition of the patient's discomfort, the provider should stop the physical examination and address the patient's concerns. In some women, performing the bimanual examination with one finger before the speculum examination is helpful in decreasing anxiety. In addition, a narrow speculum (narrow Pederson, Huffman, or pediatric) can be used to decrease discomfort. </p><p>If it becomes clear that the patient has been abused or is suffering from severe anxiety, the provider may need to delay the examination in order to elicit help from a therapist or social worker. Often by discussing the examination ahead of time and agreeing to stop uncomfortable procedures at the patient's request, the provider can give the woman some control over the situation, which may alleviate some of her anxiety regarding the examination. Importantly, the provider should never proceed in the setting of patient refusal, no matter how medically necessary he or she perceives the examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pelvic examination is traditionally performed in the dorsal lithotomy position in order to allow optimal exposure of the internal and external genitalia and palpation of the pelvis. Unfortunately, laying the patient in a horizontal position does not allow eye contact between the provider and patient, and may increase her sense of vulnerability. This may also be a physically difficult position for women with cardiorespiratory or musculoskeletal limitations.

The speculum is then inserted and downward pressure applied. The speculum is advanced in a direction free of resistance and opened as the apex of the vagina is reached.</p><p>Vaginal lesions, anomalies, or atrophic mucosa are noted. If abnormal discharge is identified, the volume, color, consistency, and odor should be noted and a sample taken with a cotton swab.

Only a single finger can be inserted comfortably in patients with a narrow introitus or small vaginal orifice. The abdominal hand should be used to sweep the pelvic organs downward, while the vaginal hand is simultaneously elevating them.</p><p>The uterus is assessed for size, shape, symmetry, mobility, position, and consistency.

Examples include severe physical limitations, patient intolerance due to pain or anxiety, or examination of small children. In such cases, the examination may need to be performed with conscious sedation or general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-examination-under-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic examination under anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'History and physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Suggestions for facilitating gynecologic examination of disabled women are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51647 \">table 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20370127\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination after hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for pelvic examination are the same for women who have undergone hysterectomy as for other women. The exception to this is that most women who have undergone total hysterectomy (the cervix has been removed) do not require Pap tests. In the past, many clinicians performed vaginal Pap tests in this patient population. However, the risk of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or vaginal cancer is extremely low in women who have undergone total hysterectomy for benign disease (excluding CIN 2,3) and, for this reason, screening guidelines in the United States from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Cancer Society (ACS), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concur that these women do not need post-hysterectomy vaginal cytology. Vaginal cancer screening is advisable in women with risk factors for vaginal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer#H3215104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Prior hysterectomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report#H9531352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical and vaginal cytology: Interpretation of results (Pap test report)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal cytology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up#H518743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;, section on 'Posthysterectomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up#H518671\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;, section on 'Hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>ACOG guidelines state that some women may choose to stop having pelvic examinations after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, if asymptomatic and if there are not other factors that increase the risk of pelvic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2506475\" class=\"local\">'When to discontinue examinations'</a> above.)</p><p>Examination of women following hysterectomy or other gynecologic surgery (eg, oophorectomy) is generally the same as for other women, but the examination and documentation of the findings should reflect the patient&rsquo;s current anatomy. As an example, in a patient who has undergone a total hysterectomy, the examiner should note that the cervix is surgically absent and record the condition of the vaginal cuff (eg, well-healed). In some cases, women are not certain of the details of their surgical procedure, including whether the cervix or one or both ovaries or tubes were conserved. The definitive documentation of this is in the operative note. If this is not available, the clinician can confirm the absence of the cervix on examination and the absence of the ovaries with pelvic imaging, if this information is needed for clinical reasons.</p><p>Women who have had a total hysterectomy continue to be at risk of sexually transmitted infections of the urethra. Thus, women at risk of, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with symptoms of, these infections should be tested for gonorrhea or chlamydia with urine testing.

She should be interviewed alone under most circumstances. It is particularly important to avoid making assumptions about a woman's background (as an example, that she is sexually active or heterosexual). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common gynecologic concerns relate to vaginal discharge, abnormal bleeding, pain, urinary problems, breast disorders, sexual dysfunction, and infertility. When a patient identifies one of these issues, detailed questioning can guide further evaluation and diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Problem focused history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pelvic examination traditionally includes the internal and external genitalia, pelvic organs. The abdomen and breasts are also commonly examined. The pelvic examination is traditionally performed in the dorsal lithotomy position in order to allow optimal exposure of the internal and external genitalia and palpation of the pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no defined age at which the first gynecologic examination is performed, as this depends upon the probability of identifying a gynecologic problem. Screening examinations generally begin at age 21, when cervical cancer screening is initiated. (See <a href=\"#H6245397\" class=\"local\">'Age at initial examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No universal guidelines exist regarding the use of a chaperone during the examination. Although charges of inappropriate conduct during a pelvic examination are rare, both male and female providers should consider utilizing a chaperone.
