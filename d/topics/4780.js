This is especially true in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which the cytokine milieu of the joint is reasonably well-understood and in which data on human clinical trials are already available. Therapies designed to block the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 receptor (IL-6R) action in this illness are effective in many patients with RA, as are TNF inhibitors and IL-17A inhibitors in psoriatic arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although biologic agents that regulate cytokines have met with success in the treatment of RA and other inflammatory arthropathies, small molecules that block cytokine production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signaling may have a competitive advantage in the coming years. An important note of caution, however, is that there is the possibility that suppressing even physiologic concentrations of some cytokines could have serious adverse effects on immune surveillance.</p><p>This topic will review the issues relating to the manipulation of cytokine networks in patients with rheumatic disease, with an emphasis on RA. The pathogenesis of RA is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INHIBITION OF CYTOKINE PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A host of biologic and small molecules with anticytokine properties are being developed or are already in clinical use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>), which are potent transcriptional inhibitors of production of a variety of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been available for many years and have clear utility in rheumatic disorders. It is not certain whether this activity accounts for their therapeutic benefit or, more likely, whether it represents only one of many effects of glucocorticoids. Other activities that might be therapeutically important include the inhibition of adhesion molecule expression, arachidonic acid metabolism, and metalloproteinase production. These and other effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other inhibitors of cytokine gene transcription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other anticytokine approaches are in earlier stages of development. As examples, transcription of cytokine genes can be reduced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and adenosine receptor agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Thalidomide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thalidomide</a>, a teratogenic sedative, decreases the transcription genes for proinflammatory cytokines and also decreases the stability of mRNA, particularly for TNF. However, adverse effects of thalidomide limit the usefulness of this agent in the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Analogues of thalidomide with greater potency in inhibiting TNF production that are not teratogenic in appropriate animal models may be candidates for study in patients with rheumatic diseases. One such analogue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, is being studied as a potential treatment for multiple myeloma and myelodysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphodiesterase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> (oxpentifylline), inhibits TNF transcription and abrogates experimental arthritis in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in several small, unblinded clinical trials, it produced minimal clinical benefits and was poorly tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The clinical usefulness of agents that selectively inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>) has been studied and has entered clinical practice in primary and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension, including that associated with systemic sclerosis. Other inhibitors of PDE (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a>) has been being studied in clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-vascular-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-treatment#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary vascular disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Treatment&quot;, section on 'Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors'</a>). Apremilast is now approved for use in people with psoriatic arthritis, providing proof of concept that PDE4 at least is a viable therapeutic target.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenosine agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibition of transcription of TNF is one of the properties of adenosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Increased production of adenosine is suggested to be one of the mechanisms of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p>Longer-lived adenosine agonists that interact with the A3 adenosine receptor have antiinflammatory effects and reduce production of TNF when studied in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Use of adenosine agonists in humans may be limited by dose-related adverse effects including flushing, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Short-term use of tolerable oral doses of one such agonist, CF101, in healthy human subjects suggested that clinical trials of this approach to treatment of inflammatory arthritis may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibiting posttranslational processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokine production can also be interrupted by blocking posttranslational processing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibition of the IL-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) is one example of reducing cytokine production by inhibiting posttranslational protein processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. ICE is responsible for cleaving the inactive precursor of IL-1 beta into an active molecule, and an ICE inhibitor should decrease the release of biologically active IL-1. This approach might also be expected to reduce the synthesis of IL-18, a cytokine that is part of the IL-1 superfamily and that has pleiotropic effects, particularly stimulation of Th1 immune responses (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin-18'</a> below). TNF is also produced though a pathway that may be amenable to a similar approach.</p><p>A preliminary study of an oral ICE inhibitor, pralnacasan, has been conducted in humans with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Antiinflammatory effects were noted, and diarrhea and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse effects. Clinical studies of this agent have been halted due to the finding of hepatotoxic effects in animals that received the drug for several months. Testing has not progressed successfully through larger controlled trials, and the drug is not being developed further for this purpose. Other caspase inhibitors have similarly been of limited success when tested in clinical trials as opposed to animal models, and this approach is deemed unlikely to succeed at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The membrane protein, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), is a therapeutic target that is under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although attractive in theory, this has a potential disadvantage in reducing secretion of TNF but not necessarily reducing membrane TNF expression. The latter may be of pathogenetic importance. Early clinical trial data have been disappointing, and this is not a likely development pathway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibiting intracellular signaling pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibition of cytokine production can also be approached from the level of transcription factors and signal transduction pathways. Various kinase-dependent pathways have been targeted by kinase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitogen activated kinase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibitors of the p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAP kinase) pathway block TNF and IL-1 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although such agents are effective in various animal models of inflammation, many different MAP kinase inhibitors have failed in clinical trials and have been associated with significant adverse effects, particularly hepatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Intriguing early (two-week) beneficial effects on acute phase responses upon p38 blockade have not been sustained over the duration of three-month trials. This may reflect the combined pro- and antiinflammatory homeostatic effects of p38 in macrophages, such that inhibition leads to net neutral effects in the clinic.</p><p>The possibility that inhibition of molecules &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; in the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway (eg, MAP kinase kinase [MAPKK]) can reduce inflammatory cytokine production with a lower risk of toxicity is being actively investigated, as is the possibility that targeting MAPK expression in distinct tissues may offer better therapeutic utility. MAPKK3 and MAPKK6 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in model systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NF-kB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. Gene therapy approaches that inhibit NF-kB may ameliorate joint swelling and destruction in the streptococcal cell wall arthritis model in rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Small molecule inhibitors of the NF-kB complex are being sought.</p><p>As an example, when NF-kB is associated with another protein (inhibitor of kappa B [IKB]), the complex is excluded from the nucleus. Phosphorylation of IKB by IKB kinase (IKK) leads to dissociation of the inhibitor from NF-kB and allows the transcription factor to pass into the nucleus, in which NF-kB dimers bind to and promote transcription of DNA. An inhibitor of IKK has antiinflammatory effects in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The broad regulatory activities of NF-kB in immune function and beyond, however, raise the possibility of unwanted adverse events upon therapeutic inhibition, and the likely toxicity to benefit ratio of novel agents is not easily predicted. It is possible that selective manipulation of the non-canonical NF-kB signal pathways may confer an advantage, though this has not been examined in clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INHIBITION OF CYTOKINE ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a cytokine gene has been expressed and the product has been released into the milieu, an alternative therapeutic approach is to bind or neutralize the factor. Another approach is to inhibit signal transduction by the cytokine receptors. Several different types of cytokine inhibitors have been tested in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); the primary focus has been on the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1, although several agents targeting other cytokines are in advanced trials. Increased production of these cytokines by synovial macrophages may play an important role in disease activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">TNF inhibition</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-TNF antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most exciting advances in the therapy of RA was the demonstration of clinical efficacy of a monoclonal anti-TNF antibody. Proof of concept was obtained by administration of the mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody cA2 (now known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) to patients with RA resulting in rapid and impressive improvement in pain, swelling, and general sense of well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Subsequent studies have established the efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies in other rheumatic diseases including spondyloarthropathies (eg, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two fully human anti-TNF antibodies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a>, which are available. Similarly, polyethylene-glycolated Fab' fragment with anti-TNF reactivity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=certolizumab-pegol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">certolizumab pegol</a>, is also available for use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, in human studies, this has not been confirmed since TNF blockade does appear to be associated with retarding erosive progression. Several of the available TNF-blocking agents may retard or prevent articular damage even in the absence of clear clinical disease activity responses.

The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a glycoprotein produced by macrophages that competitively inhibits IL-1-alpha and IL-1-beta binding to IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. IL-1ra is a pure receptor antagonist since it does not induce signal transduction or internalization of the ligand-receptor complex. Although IL-1ra binds to the IL-1R with high affinity, 10- to 100-fold excess IL-1ra is needed to inhibit IL-1 activity. Human recombinant IL-1ra (anakinra) has received regulatory approval and is available for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It has not, however, proven of particular utility in the treatment of RA, and it is rarely used in RA due to its lower efficacy compared with other biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</p><p>Several reports and controlled studies suggest it may be useful in treating other rheumatic disorders such as Still&rsquo;s disease and some of the so-called autoinflammatory conditions, such as neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and the Muckle-Wells syndrome.

In the absence of these factors, inflammatory processes are exaggerated and can lead to pathologic conditions. Thus, one possible approach to the treatment of rheumatic disease is to supply exogenous suppressive cytokines in an attempt to downregulate the overactive response. The following are some examples of possible cytokine activities with inhibitory potential. However, at this stage, few have shown convincing efficacy in clinical studies, and it remains unclear whether this approach can truly reestablish immune homeostasis necessary for therapeutic benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Transforming growth factor-beta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a prototypic example of a suppressive cytokine that down-regulates a variety of immunologic functions. Parenteral administration can suppress arthritis in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. TGF-beta is the major T-cell inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fluid, and some animal studies suggest that systemic TGF-beta exposure can decrease synovial inflammation. One potentially confounding observation is that TGF-beta is already abundant in the joint; it is, therefore, not certain whether the administration of additional exogenous growth factor would be useful. TGF-beta may also have proinflammatory effects in RA and may actually contribute to pannus formation and to cartilage destruction. Another concern relates to profibrotic properties of TGF-beta.

The synovial intimal lining is the primary source of these enzymes. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are produced by local macrophages and induce expression of proteases (eg, collagenase and stromelysin) by synovial fibroblasts in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>While suppression of MMP gene expression by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines is possible, a more direct approach is equally plausible. One could use more traditional medicinal chemistry techniques to synthesize specific protease inhibitors.

Joint destruction, however, would be prevented by the inhibitor.</p><p>A collagenase inhibitor has been tested in an animal model of arthritis, and joint destruction was markedly decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Joint swelling was also suppressed, suggesting that metalloproteinases contribute to inflammation as well as joint destruction.</p><p>Developers of novel metalloproteinase inhibitors have been frustrated by the frequent occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia when nonspecific inhibitors have been used in clinical trials as cancer chemotherapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensive stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a>).

IL-1 and TNF induce adhesion molecule expression by synovial endothelial cells; the adhesion molecules subsequently recruit cells from the circulation.

The most advanced strategy is to administer anti-ICAM-1 antibody to block CD18-mediated binding of circulating leukocytes to activated endothelium. There is little published information on these approaches in chronic models of arthritis. A preliminary study of treatment with a monoclonal anti-ICAM antibody in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suggested that some clinical improvement could be achieved concomitant with suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In this study, 32 refractory patients were treated with increasing doses of antibody. Thirteen of 23 patients who received a five-day course had evidence of improvement for a period of up to one month. Peripheral lymphocytosis was observed (perhaps because cells could not enter the tissues), and several patients developed cutaneous anergy. However, toxicity occurred as the anti-ICAM-1 antibody, which is derived from the mouse, is immunogenic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Small molecule mediators of inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokines are, in large part, responsible for regulating production of many small molecule mediators of inflammation.

These arachidonic acid metabolites increase vascular permeability, act as chemoattractants, and enhance nociception. As a result, suppression of arachidonic acid metabolism by enzyme inhibitors (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) has proven to be an effective symptomatic approach in RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of other small molecule mediators are potential targets in RA, including neuropeptides and bradykinin. Other possible targets are important enzymes that are regulated by cytokines (eg, phospholipase A2, COX-2, and many others).</p><p>Agents that are highly selective for the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase are available for clinical use. While these drugs have largely fulfilled the promise of reduced gastroduodenal toxicity, some unanticipated adverse cardiovascular effects have been noted, particularly with two highly selective COX-2 inhibitors, rofecoxib and valdecoxib, which have been withdrawn from the market.

Cells that express the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor represent one potential target. High-affinity IL-2 receptors are displayed by activated T and B cells. If these cells were selectively killed, then the immune process in the synovium could theoretically be suppressed. In order to accomplish this goal, a recombinant fusion protein comprised of IL-2 and diphtheria toxin has been developed. This recombinant protein would selectively deliver the toxin to cells expressing the IL-2 receptor.</p><p>Clinical trials have been performed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using this chimeric molecule, producing very little benefit despite substantial toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The lack of efficacy suggests that high-affinity IL-2 receptor-bearing cells (which are primarily lymphocytes) are not essential in RA.
