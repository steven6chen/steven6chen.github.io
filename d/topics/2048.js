The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes and nearly always experience major depressive and hypomanic episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89746 \">table 4</a>). Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11685824\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bipolar disorder can present with mania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 1</a>), hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 2</a>), major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398 \">table 3</a>), or mixed features (mood episodes that are accompanied by symptoms of the opposite polarity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The severity of these syndromes varies widely across patients, as well as within individual patients, and subsyndromal symptoms are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In addition, some symptomatic patients remit and become euthymic, while other patients transition immediately from one type of syndrome to another (eg, from major depression to mania) without an intervening period of euthymia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The mood episode at onset of bipolar disorder is usually major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a study of 2308 patients, the first lifetime episode was [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major depression in 54 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mania in 22 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed (concurrent symptoms of major depression and mania) in 24 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975366\"><span class=\"h2\">Prodrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many studies indicate that prodromal signs and symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, mood lability (&ldquo;mood swings&rdquo;), agitation, aggressiveness, sleep disturbance, and hyperactivity may precede onset of diagnosable bipolar disorder, the proportion of patients who experience a prodrome varies widely across studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In addition, the same features can occur during the prodrome of other psychiatric disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11685831\"><span class=\"h2\">Mania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manic episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 1</a>) involve clinically significant changes in mood, energy, activity, behavior, sleep, and cognition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F86880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86880 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is not known whether the symptom profile of mania is consistent across multiple episodes within the same patient. However, episodes are often similar within a given patient for at least part of the illness. As an example, a patient prone to euphoric mania is likely to suffer repeated episodes of euphoric mania unless substance abuse, head injury, or duration of illness leads to a change in presentation. The intensity of manic episodes varies widely across patients.</p><p>Abnormally elevated, irritable, and labile mood is a core symptom required to diagnose mania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Classic mania is marked by an unusually good, euphoric, or high mood, which may be accompanied by disinhibition (eg, wearing garish clothes or disrobing in public), disregard for social boundaries, expansiveness, and a relentless pursuit of stimulation and social activities (eg, acting flirtatious, renewing old friendships, or lengthy telephone calls with strangers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The elevated mood may have an infectious quality that initially engages others; however, patients often become offensive due to their insensitivity to the needs of others.</p><p>Another core diagnostic symptom of mania is persistently increased energy and activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Increased planning and activity is typically marked by impulsivity, poor judgement, and disregard for risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Examples include taking on new and foolish business ventures, unaffordable spending sprees, sexual infidelity or sexual encounters with strangers, and driving recklessly. In addition, patients are often unable to complete the many tasks or projects that are started. Two independent nationally representative surveys in the United States and a third survey in Australia, which identified individuals with mania in the general population, all found that increased goal-directed activity was the most commonly endorsed symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Manic patients generally have an exaggerated sense of wellbeing and self-confidence, which may extend to grandiosity of psychotic proportions (see <a href=\"#H1673780\" class=\"local\">'Psychosis'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, some patients believe they have a special relationship with God or celebrities, or possess talents that surpass the abilities of others. Among individuals with mania in the general population, increased self-esteem and grandiosity are the least commonly endorsed symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>In addition, mania is typically marked by a decreased need for sleep; this is distinguished from insomnia, which involves the inability to sleep despite feeling tired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Manic patients may feel well-rested, or energetic and &ldquo;wired,&rdquo; despite sleeping for only a few (eg, three) hours or not all, and patients may go for days without sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Common cognitive symptoms of mania include increased mental activity, racing thoughts, distractibility, and difficulty distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant thoughts; these symptoms result in flight of ideas (abrupt changes from one topic to another that are based upon understandable associations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, patients may not recall events that occur during manic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Manic speech is generally loud, pressured or accelerated, and difficult to interrupt, and may be accompanied by jokes, singing, clanging (choosing words based upon sounds rather than meaning), and dramatic gesticulations. Irritable patients often make hostile comments, swear more than usual, or go off on angry tirades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>As a result, psychosocial functioning is markedly impaired, and hospitalization is often required to protect manic patients and prevent behavior leading to painful consequences (eg, financial ruin, job loss, divorce, and assaulting others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>]. One impediment to treatment is that many patients, particularly those who are psychotic, have little insight into their psychopathology and functional impairment, and are impervious to feedback from others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>The course of illness in mania may be marked by a sudden onset, and episodes progress quickly over a few days. The duration of manic episodes ranges from weeks to months; in a prospective observational study of 246 manic episodes, recovery from 25 percent of the episodes occurred within 4 weeks of onset, and recovery from 50 percent and 75 percent of the episodes occurred within 7 and 15 weeks of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Resolution of mania typically does not involve residual symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11685838\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypomania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypomanic episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 2</a>) are characterized by changes in mood, energy, activity, behavior, sleep, and cognition that are similar to those of mania, but less severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-esteem may be inflated during hypomania, but never reaches the point of delusional grandiosity that can occur during mania.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although mental overactivity and flight of ideas can occur in either hypomania or mania, thought form is more organized in hypomania.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinking in hypomania is often quick and creative, and leads to productive increases in goal-directed activities, whereas mania is marked by racing thoughts that are disconnected and lead to aimless or ineffective overactivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypomanic speech can be loud and rapid, but typically is easier to interrupt than manic speech.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial functioning in hypomania is either improved or mildly impaired, whereas mania markedly impairs functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk-taking behavior in hypomania is mild to moderate, but in mania is severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By definition, psychotic symptoms do not occur in hypomania, and hypomania never necessitates hospitalization. Patients with psychotic features and patients who require hospitalization are classifies as manic (see <a href=\"#H11685831\" class=\"local\">'Mania'</a> above).</p><p/><p>The course of hypomania is such that it generally begins suddenly and progresses quickly over one to two days. Episodes typically resolve within several weeks; a prospective observational study of 126 hypomanic episodes found that recovery from 25 percent of the episodes occurred within two weeks of onset, and recovery from 50 percent and 75 percent of the episodes occurred within three and six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Hypomanic symptoms in some patients may be more fleeting than manic symptoms. Nevertheless, hypomanic symptoms must be taken seriously because they may indicate increasing instability and the need for treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2272752\"><span class=\"h2\">Major depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398 \">table 3</a>) involve clinically significant changes in mood, behavior, energy, sleep, and cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The intensity of episodes varies widely.</p><p>Similar to unipolar major depression, bipolar major depression is generally characterized by dysphoria, as well as slowing in the pace of mental and physical activity (eg, speech is slow and soft, and output reduced) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Interest in pleasurable activities (eg, sex) is minimal, energy is low, and memory and concentration are impaired. Appetite is typically diminished and accompanied by weight loss; however, some patients may manifest increased appetite and weight gain. Although behavior is generally slow, some patients are agitated (eg, unable to sit still or wringing their hands). Sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia) often occur in bipolar depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], as do feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and suicidal thoughts and behavior. (See <a href=\"#H4504518\" class=\"local\">'Suicide'</a> below.)</p><p>Other clinical features of major depression include poor eye contact, poor hygiene, unkempt appearance, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, rumination and indecisiveness, negative and nihilistic thoughts, somatic symptoms (eg, pain), and impaired psychosocial functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional information about the clinical manifestation of major depression is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Depressive symptoms are more common in bipolar disorder than <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms, especially in bipolar II patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational study of 146 bipolar I patients who were followed for an average of 13 years examined the mean percent of time that patients had any depressive, <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic,</span> or mixed (concurrent depressive and <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic)</span> symptoms; pure depressive symptoms were present for 32 percent of follow-up, pure <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms for 9 percent, and mixed symptoms for 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comparable study of 86 bipolar II patients who were followed prospectively for an average of 13 years found that pure depressive symptoms were present for 50 percent of follow-up, pure hypomanic symptoms for 1 percent, and mixed symptoms for 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>The symptom profile of bipolar major depression is often inconsistent across multiple episodes within a particular patient. A study of 583 patients with at least two prospectively observed depressive episodes found that within an individual patient, there was little consistency in the specific symptoms or sets of symptoms from one episode to the next [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The course of illness in bipolar major depression varies, and onset may be sudden or develop slowly over weeks to months. Episodes typically last several months. A prospective observational study of 373 bipolar major depressive episodes found that recovery from 25 percent of the episodes occurred within 6 weeks of onset, and recovery from 50 percent and 75 percent of the episodes occurred within 15 and 35 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Many of these findings were replicated in a subsequent study using the same dataset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of nine observational studies found that aggressive behavior occurred in more bipolar patients (n &gt;6000) than general population controls (n &gt;112,000) (10 versus 3 percent; odds ratio 4); however, heterogeneity across studies was large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. A subsequent prospective study, which adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, victimization (abuse) in childhood, negative life events, and poor social support, also found that bipolar individuals were four times more likely to perpetrate physical violence than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>].</p><p/><p>Other epidemiologic studies indicate that among bipolar patients, comorbid intermittent explosive disorder occurs in approximately 25 to 30 percent.

In addition, aggressive behavior in bipolar patients was more common during mood episodes.</p><p>Aggression in bipolar patients may be elevated even during periods of euthymia. A study found greater levels of aggression (assessed with a standardized scale) in 24 euthymic bipolar patients in stable treatment, compared with 38 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>].</p><p>Assessment and management of agitation and aggressive behavior are discussed separately.

A pooled analysis of three observational studies (n = 428 bipolar patients) found that the six month prevalence of violence perpetration and violence victimization was 27 and 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. In addition, there was a strong association between the occurrence of perpetration and victimization (odds ratio 9); however, perpetration and victimization may have occurred during the same incidents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20903479\"><span class=\"h1\">LEGAL PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manic patients often incur criminal justice problems.
