In addition, randomized trials that compared pharmacotherapy alone with psychotherapy alone in depressed outpatients found that the benefits of each modality were comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Antidepressants alone have been studied and used more often than combination treatment or psychotherapy alone because antidepressants are generally more available and convenient than psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>], and some patients prefer pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other factors to consider in choosing a treatment regimen are comorbidity, psychosocial stressors, and cost.</p><p>The use of pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy alone, or psychotherapy alone for unipolar major depression is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>].

These inflated effects may be due to low quality studies, as well as publication bias.</p><p>Psychotherapy studies are methodologically variable, like pharmacotherapy studies. Some psychotherapy trials are rigorous and specify a priori hypotheses and analytic tests, develop manuals for the psychotherapies and measure adherence on the part of therapists, use active psychotherapy comparators that control for the nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy, use standardized diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, stratify patients on predetermined risk variables, and blind assessment of outcome ratings. Less meticulous studies use open-label designs, less rigorous comparators (eg, treatment as usual or waiting lists), or fail to adequately blind outcome ratings. Although it is commonly believed that blinding of patients in psychotherapy is less successful compared with pharmacotherapy trials, this has never been studied.</p><p>The evidence for the efficacy of psychotherapy in primary care patients and in the context of general medical illnesses is discussed separately.

As an example, a meta-analysis of 28 randomized trials compared psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy for the acute treatment of 3381 patients with unipolar depressive disorders, and found that improvement was comparable; heterogeneity across studies was moderate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In the 11 studies (602 patients) that followed patients after treatment ended and assessed their depressive symptoms (mean length of follow-up 15 months), there was a significant, clinically small to moderate effect favoring psychotherapy over antidepressants. Relapse is common in patients who remit after acute treatment with antidepressants and then discontinue their medications.

Consequently, we generally use medications such as second generation antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, divalproex, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, rather than antidepressants. </p><p>One high quality study regarding treatment of depression with mixed features is a six-week randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lurasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lurasidone</a> with placebo in 208 patients with unipolar major depression with mixed features (two or three <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. Improvement of both depressive and manic symptoms was greater with lurasidone, and remission occurred in more patients with lurasidone than placebo (49 versus 23 percent). Several adverse effects also occurred more frequently with lurasidone, including nausea, somnolence, akathisia, dizziness, dry mouth, and Parkinsonism; however, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects was comparable with lurasidone and placebo (3 and 5 percent). This trial supports the use of lurasidone, but does not imply that lurasidone is superior to other second generation antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, divalproex, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21696608\"><span class=\"h1\">MINOR DEPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management and treatment of minor depression are discussed separately, as are the clinical features and diagnosis.

However, pharmacotherapy alone and psychotherapy alone are reasonable alternatives. Many specific antidepressant-psychotherapy combinations are available, and the superiority of any particular combination has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H21696456\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a treatment regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several classes of antidepressants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 3</a>) are available to treat unipolar major depression, and the efficacy of different antidepressants is generally comparable across and within classes. Choosing a drug is thus based upon other factors, including safety, side effect profile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 4</a>), comorbid illnesses, concurrent medications and potential drug-drug interactions, ease of use, patient preference, and cost. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with unipolar major depression who are initially treated with antidepressants, we suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) rather than other antidepressants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, atypical antidepressants, and serotonin modulators are reasonable alternatives. Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are typically not used as initial treatment because of concerns about safety and adverse effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21696468\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of antidepressants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21696492\" class=\"local\">'Selecting a specific antidepressant'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21696498\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several psychotherapies are available to treat unipolar major depression. For patients with major depression who are initially treated with psychotherapy, we suggest cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy rather than other psychotherapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, reasonable alternatives to CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy include behavioral activation, family and couples therapy, problem solving therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and supportive psychotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H21696474\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of psychotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21696528\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically start antidepressants at low doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 3</a>) in order to reduce side effects. (See <a href=\"#H21696504\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with unipolar major depression who start antidepressants, improvement is often apparent within two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H21696516\" class=\"local\">'Early improvement and response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally treat unipolar major depression for 6 to 12 weeks before deciding whether antidepressants have sufficiently relieved symptoms. However, for patients who show little improvement (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms &le;25 percent) after four to six weeks, it is reasonable to administer next-step treatment. (See <a href=\"#H21696522\" class=\"local\">'Duration of an adequate trial'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) that are present nearly every day, as indicated by a score &ge;20 points on the Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>). For patients with severe unipolar major depression, we suggest initial treatment with pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, rather than other treatment regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, a reasonable alternative is pharmacotherapy alone or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). For patients with severe suicidality or malnutrition secondary to food refusal, we suggest ECT as initial treatment rather than other treatment regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21696590\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a treatment regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Indications for and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe unipolar major depression who are treated with antidepressants, we suggest serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs, rather than other antidepressants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We typically start with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Reasonable alternatives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> and tricyclic antidepressants. (See <a href=\"#H21696596\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an antidepressant'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by dysphoria and at least two other depressive symptoms lasting for two or more years. For patients with persistent depressive disorder, we suggest antidepressants plus psychotherapy rather than antidepressants alone or psychotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, antidepressants (eg, SSRIs) alone are a reasonable alternative; psychotherapy alone is also reasonable for patients who prefer it.
