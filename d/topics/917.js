Patients with orthopedic injury may require anesthesia for emergency repair or damage control surgery, or for semielective procedures after evaluation and stabilization.</p><p>This topic will discuss the general approach to anesthesia for adult patients with orthopedic injuries, anesthesia for specific categories of orthopedic injury, and options for both regional and general anesthesia for these cases. Initial management of trauma in adults, damage control surgery and resuscitation, anesthesia for patients with spinal cord injury, and management of the difficult airway are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe pelvic fracture in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe extremity injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-acute-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with acute traumatic brain injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4227921497\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preanesthesia evaluation of patients with orthopedic trauma should be as thorough as the urgency of the situation allows. Initial assessment should be guided by advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>When possible, the full extent of the patient's injuries, course since injury, medical history, allergies, medications, and last oral intake should be reviewed. An airway assessment and directed physical examination should be performed. The patient may be unable to provide an accurate medical history because of head trauma, alcohol or illicit drug use, dementia, or severe pain.</p><p>Results of laboratory testing should be reviewed, including electrolytes, glucose, hemoglobin, platelet count, coagulation parameters, and lactate. Hemoglobin may be normal in patients who are hypovolemic, and may drop as the patient is resuscitated.</p><p>Other diagnostic studies, dictated by the patient's other injuries, should be reviewed as well. Preoperative cardiac evaluation should be guided by the patient's clinical status and cardiac risk factors. Preoperative cardiac testing beyond an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed only if it will change anesthetic or medical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Signs and symptoms of severe associated injuries may be delayed in patients who have sustained multitrauma. The anesthesia and surgical teams should maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax, internal bleeding, brain injury, and pulmonary or cardiac contusion throughout the perioperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1523129593\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with orthopedic trauma should be managed according to advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols, which include initial evaluation, stabilization, resuscitation, and determination of the extent of injury and need for further treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multitrauma</strong> &ndash; Unstable patients with severe trauma impacting multiple organs may be treated according to damage control protocols. For patients with orthopedic injury, this may mean initial quick application of external fixation, rather than definitive repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury#H909588550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe extremity injury&quot;, section on 'Damage control surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Orthopedic emergencies</strong> &ndash; Fractures that result in neurovascular compromise are true emergencies. Vascular injury can be limb-threatening and, in proximal vessels, life-threatening. Decompressive fasciotomy for compartment syndrome is also an emergent, limb-saving, and potentially life-saving procedure. Open fracture debridement should be considered an urgent but not emergency procedure. Early debridement (ie, within six hours) has not been shown to reduce the risk of infection compared with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and delayed debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonemergent injury</strong> &ndash; For those whose initial or definitive surgery can be delayed, the patient should be physiologically stabilized and medically evaluated prior to coming to the operating room. This includes older patients with hip fracture. In general, we perform surgery for hip fracture within 24 to 48 hours for patients who are medically stable, without significant comorbid illness. We wait up to 72 hours for surgery in patients with active comorbidity who would benefit from preoperative medical evaluation and management. Medical evaluation for patients with hip fracture is discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for patients with hip fracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Surgery should not be delayed to allow the stomach to empty. Pain and opioid medications slow or stop gastric emptying; the fasting interval should be the time between last oral intake and the injury. Therefore, most patients with orthopedic trauma are at risk for aspiration during induction of anesthesia and should be managed with rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267713854\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL COORDINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative multidisciplinary communication among the anesthesia and surgery teams should be comprehensive and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The planned procedure or procedures, and sequence of procedures, including the early placement of continuous peripheral nerve blocks for pain control prior to definitive procedure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgency of surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative positioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected blood loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected duration of surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of tourniquet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432171082\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique (ie, general anesthesia, neuraxial anesthesia, or peripheral nerve block) depends on the planned procedures and patient factors, including comorbidities. As examples, neuraxial and regional anesthesia may be beneficial for patients with severe reactive airway disease in order to avoid airway manipulation for general anesthesia. In contrast, the sympathectomy that results from spinal anesthesia may cause severe hypotension for patients with aortic stenosis or unresuscitated hypovolemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia#H867269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Physiologic effects of neuraxial anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma#H115102450\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma&quot;, section on 'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a>.)</p><p>Regional anesthesia may be beneficial, even if it is not the primary surgical anesthetic, as part of a balanced anesthetic along with general anesthesia to reduce intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements.</p><p>Regional anesthesia for specific categories of injuries is discussed below and is shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3638349782\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for upper extremity trauma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H634761203\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for lower extremity trauma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3930437870\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic fracture'</a> below.) </p><p>General concerns related to the choice of anesthetic technique for orthopedic trauma include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple injuries</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>General anesthesia is used for most cases of emergent severe multitrauma and for surgery on more than one area of the body. If RA is employed, multiple sites of orthopedic injury may increase the risk of a wrong-sided block. Generally, the use of continuous RA to control pain in a single extremity is inappropriate when high-dose opioids are required for other injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient cooperation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients who are intoxicated, under the influence of illicit drugs, or in severe pain may be unable to cooperate with placement of neuraxial or regional anesthetic blocks. If deep sedation is required either to perform regional anesthesia or during surgery, the risk of aspiration may be high; general endotracheal anesthesia may be preferred for such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positioning</strong> &ndash; Pain or potential for aggravating an injury may make positioning for block placement impossible or inadvisable. However, peripheral nerve block may be used for pain relief to allow positioning for neuraxial anesthesia (eg, femoral block to allow positioning for spinal anesthesia for hip or femur fracture).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, the position for surgery may be uncomfortable and may require deep sedation or general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypovolemia</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Preoperative hypovolemia or the expectation of significant intraoperative blood loss may preclude the use of neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial techniques cause a sympathectomy that can result in severe hypotension, especially in hypovolemic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520191777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamic management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Neuraxial anesthesia and some regional anesthesia techniques are relatively contraindicated for patients with coagulopathy, which can be the result of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, medical disorders, or coagulation abnormalities related to their injuries. Patients may be coagulopathic because of hypothermia or hemodilution from initial trauma resuscitative measures, or due to aggressive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in these high-risk patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-acute-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with acute traumatic brain injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The plan for postoperative anticoagulation should be coordinated with the surgeon when regional anesthesia is considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postoperative pain control</strong> &ndash; RA may be placed for postoperative pain control, even if general anesthesia is used for the primary surgery. Single-injection nerve block can provide pain control for positioning or for the immediate postoperative period, but generally, continuous techniques with epidural or peripheral nerve block catheters are indicated. Patients with a single site of severe pain may benefit from continuous RA techniques while awaiting surgery, to improve mobility and reduce the sympathetic response to pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma-related nerve injury</strong> &ndash; Orthopedic trauma may cause nerve injury, which should be documented preoperatively. If regional anesthesia is considered, the potential for masking trauma-related nerve injury or intraoperative nerve injury due to surgery should be discussed with the patient and the surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tourniquet pain</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Tourniquet pain is a potent stimulus that increases over time and can break through otherwise adequate sensory peripheral nerve block or neuraxial anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Beyond 90 minutes of tourniquet time, supplementation with systemic opioid or general anesthesia may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraoperative monitoring </strong>&ndash; The use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may help guide fluid therapy and can be used to monitor for embolic phenomena associated with the fracture itself, debris from placement of a prosthesis or intramedullary rod, and air embolism from open venous sinuses. General anesthesia is required for the use of TEE.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3638349782\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA FOR UPPER EXTREMITY TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper extremity injury may include trauma from the clavicle to the wrist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713072465\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal upper extremity fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal upper extremity orthopedic injuries include clavicle fractures, acromioclavicular joint injuries, shoulder dislocations, and proximal humerus fracture.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Choice of anesthetic technique</strong> &ndash; For proximal upper extremity surgery, general anesthesia is usually required. The distal clavicle and the anterior superior shoulder are innervated by both the cervical plexus and the brachial plexus. Therefore, two separate nerve blocks are required for analgesia for these procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques#H520467260\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve blocks of the scalp, neck, and trunk: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Cervical plexus blocks'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H320231953\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Upper extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Brachial plexus blocks'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Associated injuries</strong> &ndash; Some proximal upper extremity injuries are associated with specific nerve damage, which should be documented preoperatively. Trauma of the clavicle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> first rib may be associated with brachial plexus injury. Severe acromioclavicular joint separation can result in mechanical stretch injury of the brachial plexus, and humeral neck fractures are associated with axillary nerve trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clavicle fracture is also associated with injury of the subclavian artery. Screws used for plating of the proximal clavicle may be placed near the subclavian artery. Significant hemorrhage may occur intraoperatively, either during fracture manipulation or hardware placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shoulder dislocation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Immediate relocation of a shoulder should be performed with a brief general anesthetic using muscle relaxant. Prolonged dense regional block is not advised, as the dislocation may recur with the muscle relaxation associated with the block and prolonged pain relief is not required. Once the shoulder is relocated, pain dissipates quickly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4059330700\"><span class=\"h2\">Midhumerus fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most proximal and midshaft humerus fractures are nondisplaced and are treated conservatively. However, there are a number of indications for surgery for these injuries, including open fractures, neurovascular compromise, and excessive angulation.

Intraoperative hypotension with either technique was associated with an increase in mortality.</p><p>Many of the randomized trials comparing anesthetic techniques for hip fracture are small, have methodologic flaws, and include a wide variety of techniques that do not reflect current anesthetic or surgical practice. This is illustrated in a metaanalysis that included data from 28 randomized trials published between 1977 and 2013 comparing different methods of anesthesia for hip fracture surgery in 2976 patients; the overall quality of data was poor, and estimates of effect had wide confidence intervals, suggesting that further study is needed to determine which approach is superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There was no difference identified between regional and general anesthesia in mortality at one month, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, confusional state, or the risk of DVT when prophylaxis was used.

(See <a href=\"#H432171082\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Regional <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthesia/analgesia</span> techniques are rarely indicated for pelvic fracture for a variety of reasons, including associated spinal injuries and the potential for massive bleeding and coagulopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venous access</strong> &ndash; Large-bore intravenous (IV) catheters (eg, 14- or 16-gauge), rapid infusion catheters, or central venous catheters should be placed for pelvic fracture repair to facilitate resuscitation. A fluid warmer should be placed in line to help maintain normothermia with large fluid administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>In addition to standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors (ie, blood pressure [BP], electrocardiogram [ECG], pulse oximetry, oxygen analyzer, end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>], temperature), we place an arterial catheter for patients with pelvic fracture for continuous BP monitoring and to facilitate blood sampling. Repeated measurement of hemoglobin, coagulation parameters, platelet count, electrolytes, blood gases, and lactate is often indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We place other monitors (eg, transesophageal echocardiogram [TEE], intracranial pressure monitor, pulmonary artery catheter) when appropriate, based on clinical factors and comorbidities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluid management and transfusion</strong> &ndash; Volume resuscitation for patients with severe trauma, including pelvic fracture, starts in the field or emergency department (ED), but may continue into the operating room. For severe pelvic trauma, large volume resuscitation with IV crystalloid and blood products may be required. If a massive transfusion protocol is in place, it should be activated for the presence or likelihood of severe hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H2226562376\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Intravenous fluid resuscitation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal goal for hemoglobin in these patients is unclear and depends on comorbidities, associated injuries, and ongoing blood loss. Large-volume blood transfusion in the critically ill, hemodynamically unstable patient cannot be guided by hemoglobin levels alone and often cannot await interval measurements of hemoglobin. We typically maintain a hemoglobin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> during initial resuscitation and ongoing blood loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H607228\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Trauma/massive transfusion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with severe trauma and hemorrhage are at risk for trauma or transfusion-related coagulopathy. We follow a damage control approach to these patients and transfuse fresh frozen plasma (in units), red blood cells (in units), and platelets (in units) in a 1:1:1 ratio. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> in this patient population have not been firmly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Administration of tranexamic acid is indicated in the presence of fibrinolysis and massive hemorrhage, but routine use has not been shown to reduce red cell transfusion requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management of postoperative pain</strong> &ndash; Regional anesthesia techniques for postoperative pain are not usually practical for patients with pelvic fracture, at least during initial stabilization. We follow a multimodal approach to intraoperative and postoperative pain management for these patients including nonopioid and opioid medications, avoiding nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) because of their antiplatelet effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H85613\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postoperative disposition</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Many patients with severe pelvic fracture require intensive care after surgery because of hemodynamic instability, coagulation abnormalities, ongoing transfusion requirement, or for airway management. The decision to extubate these patients at the end of anesthesia must be individualized based on clinical factors, including the risk of airway edema related to massive volume resuscitation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1612937550\"><span class=\"h1\">FAT EMBOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subclinical fat embolism occurs in the majority of patients with long bone fractures. Fat embolism syndrome occurs in approximately 0.5 percent of these patients and is more common with bilateral fractures, during reaming for femoral intramedullary nailing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and with delayed surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-orthopedic-trauma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Fat embolism syndrome is also associated with pelvic fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-embolism-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fat embolism syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Signs and symptoms of fat embolism are nonspecific. Fat embolism should be suspected with sudden intraoperative hypoxia and tachycardia and with neurologic symptoms in awake patients (eg, headache or confusion). Treatment is supportive; rarely, fat embolism syndrome progresses to adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19373642\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia may be required for orthopedic injuries ranging from isolated, relatively minor damage to multitrauma with life-threatening hemorrhage or associated injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on the planned procedures and patient factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H432171082\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>General anesthesia is usually preferred for uncooperative patients, those with emergent severe multitrauma, those requiring procedures on multiple body areas, and when there is a contraindication to neuraxial or peripheral nerve block (eg, coagulopathy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Most patients with orthopedic trauma are nonfasting and therefore at risk for aspiration during induction of general anesthesia; such patients should be managed with rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peripheral nerve blocks can be used for surgical anesthesia and for postoperative pain management, and as a supplement to general anesthesia, for upper extremity and lower extremity surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3638349782\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for upper extremity trauma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H634761203\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for lower extremity trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal, epidural, or combined spinal&ndash;epidural [CSE]) can be used for hip and other lower extremity surgery. (See <a href=\"#H634761203\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for lower extremity trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tourniquet pain may break through otherwise adequate regional anesthesia and may require administration of systemic opioid or general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H432171082\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some orthopedic injuries are associated with specific complications in the perioperative period, as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fat embolism occurs with many long bone and pelvic fractures; most are subclinical, but fat embolism syndrome can occur and is most common with bilateral femur fracture, during reaming for intramedullary rodding, and with delayed surgery. Fat embolism should be suspected with sudden onset of intraoperative hypoxia and tachycardia and with neurologic symptoms in awake patients. (See <a href=\"#H1612937550\" class=\"local\">'Fat embolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compartment syndrome can occur with fractures of the tibia and fibula and, more rarely, with distal radius and ankle fractures. When continuous nerve block is performed for postoperative pain, dilute local anesthetic (LA) solutions should be administered for at-risk patients to facilitate evaluation for compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H2490812968\" class=\"local\">'Fracture distal to the elbow'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2179924081\" class=\"local\">'Knee and lower leg fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fractures are associated with preoperative and surgical injury of nerves near the fracture site. Neurologic deficits should be documented preoperatively and discussed when peripheral nerve block is planned. (See <a href=\"#H4059330700\" class=\"local\">'Midhumerus fracture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1713072465\" class=\"local\">'Proximal upper extremity fractures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2490812968\" class=\"local\">'Fracture distal to the elbow'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hip fracture are often older, with comorbidities. The choice of anesthetic technique for these patients should be based on the planned procedure and patient factors. The benefits of regional anesthesia compared with general anesthesia are controversial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients in whom either general or neuraxial anesthesia would be appropriate for hip fracture surgery, we suggest neuraxial anesthesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We usually prefer continuous spinal anesthesia and perform epidural anesthesia if we plan to use the epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia. (See <a href=\"#H821548315\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique for hip fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic fractures are often associated with other traumatic injuries and may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. General anesthesia is usually preferred for damage control surgery (eg, external fixation or preperitoneal packing), arterial embolization, or open internal fixation. Massive transfusion may be required.
