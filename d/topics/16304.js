The spleen is an organ in the upper left part of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61816 \">figure 1</a>). It is part of the body's infection-fighting system, or &quot;immune system.&quot; The spleen also filters the blood. It makes blood cells that help you fight infection. It removes things that could cause problems, including bacteria and damaged red blood cells.</p><p>Doctors might do a splenectomy to treat problems such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to the spleen &ndash; If your spleen gets injured, it can cause serious internal bleeding. This most often happens because a person is hit in the belly area, for example, in an accident or while playing a contact sport. If the spleen gets badly injured, it might have to be removed, especially if you have other serious injuries, too.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spleen that is much larger than usual &ndash; Doctors call this &quot;splenomegaly.&quot; Certain cancers or non-cancerous tumors or cysts can sometimes cause this. If it leads to symptoms, such as pain, you might need to have your spleen removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain disorders that affect blood cells &ndash; Examples include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immune thrombocytopenia or &quot;ITP,&quot; a disorder in which a person's own immune system destroys their platelets (a type of blood cell)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which the red blood cells are destroyed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta thalassemia major (a condition some people are born with), in which the body does not make enough red blood cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Usually, doctors try other treatments for these problems before they consider doing a splenectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2742895206\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for a splenectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible, you will need to get vaccines before your surgery. The spleen helps protect the body from infections, so you will be more likely to get infections after your spleen is removed. Vaccines help prevent this. They work by teaching your body how to fight the germs that cause infections. The vaccines you'll need include those that protect against certain bacterial infections, called pneumococcus, meningococcus, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (or &quot;Hib&quot;). You should also get the usual vaccines that doctors recommend for everyone, such as the flu vaccine. </p><p>The vaccines you get will depend on which ones you've already had, and when you got them. Ideally, you will get your vaccines at least 2 weeks before your surgery. This might not be possible if your spleen needs to be removed right away.</p><p>Your doctor will tell how long before the surgery you should stop eating and drinking. He or she will also tell you if you need to stop taking any of your medicines or start any new medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1572771292\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a splenectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the surgery starts, you will get medicines (through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;) to make you sleep. You will not be awake for the surgery.</p><p>There are 2 different ways your doctor can do a splenectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgery &ndash; During open surgery, your doctor will make a cut, often in the middle of your belly, then take out your spleen. He or she will close the cut with special staples or stitches. If your spleen is very large or has been badly injured, you will most likely need open surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery &ndash; During laparoscopic surgery, your doctor will make a few very small cuts in your belly. Then he or she will insert long, thin tools through the cuts. One of the tools (called a &quot;laparoscope&quot;) has a camera on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen. Your doctor can look at the screen to know where to cut and what to remove. Then he or she uses the long tools to do the surgery through the small cuts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2532836357\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on which type of surgery you had. If you had open surgery, you will need to stay in the hospital for a few days. If you had laparoscopic surgery, you might be able to go home the same day or the next day.</p><p>If you didn't get all your vaccines before your surgery, you will get them a few weeks afterwards. You might also get antibiotics to help your body prevent infections, since you no longer have a spleen to do this. Some people, especially children, need to take antibiotics every day for a few years, sometimes even longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2239122984\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen after a splenectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people can go back to their daily lives once they recover. But it is important to be aware of certain problems that can happen. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; The spleen helps protect the body from infections. After your spleen has been removed, your body has a harder time fighting off certain infections. Also, without a spleen, even minor infections are more likely to turn into a serious problem called &quot;sepsis.&quot; Sepsis is a serious illness that happens when an infection travels through the whole body. If it is not treated right away, it can lead to death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Getting all the vaccines your doctor recommends helps prevent many infections. But it's still possible to get an infection if you've had your vaccines. Your doctor or nurse will work with you to make a plan for what to do if you notice any signs of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because any infection could lead to sepsis, you will probably get antibiotics to keep at home. This way, you can start taking them at the first sign that you might have an infection. Signs of infection can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chills or shivering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Earache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stuffy nose or sinus pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling sleepy or confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling dizzy, or like you might pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A fast heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small purple-red dots on the skin, or unexplained bruises</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you have any of the above, your doctor might tell you to take a dose of your antibiotic right away, then <strong>go straight to the nearest urgent care clinic or emergency room</strong>. Do this even if you do not feel very sick. At the clinic or doctor's office, they can check you for infection and decide if you need more or different treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots &ndash; The risk of blood clots also goes up after splenectomy. If a blood clot happens, it is most often in the legs (called a &quot;deep vein thrombosis&quot; or &quot;DVT&quot;) or the lungs (called a &quot;pulmonary embolism&quot; or &quot;PE&quot;). Symptoms of DVT can include swelling, pain, or warmth and redness in the leg. Symptoms of PE can include trouble breathing, chest pain when you breathe in, or coughing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You can help lower your risk of blood clots by not sitting still for too long. For example, if you are sitting at a desk all day or taking a long airplane flight, you can get up and walk around every hour or so. You can also shift your position and move your legs and feet often. On a long car trip, move your legs around or stop often to get out and walk around.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H914051056\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hairy-cell-leukemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hairy cell leukemia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-thalassemia-major-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Beta thalassemia major (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mononucleosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mononucleosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fasting-before-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fasting before surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endovascular surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=questions-to-ask-if-you-are-having-surgery-or-a-procedure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Questions to ask if you are having surgery or a procedure (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-severe-infection-after-splenectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing severe infection after splenectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
