This topic discusses the benefit of taking a preprocedure antibiotic, who should take antibiotics, and provides an explanation of when antibiotics are usually recommended.</p><p>Certain procedures, such as a root canal or tooth extraction (as discussed below), may allow bacteria from the mouth to enter the bloodstream. Rarely, these bacteria can infect the heart valves and lining of the heart, causing them to become inflamed. This inflammation is called infective endocarditis (IE). IE has the potential to cause catastrophic medical problems, including heart failure and leakage of the heart valves.</p><p>When taken before a procedure, antibiotics may prevent bacteria from being released into the bloodstream. This is known as antibiotic prophylaxis.</p><p>The guidelines provided below may not apply to every situation. There may be instances in which a person has a high or moderate risk of IE and antibiotics are not recommended. In such cases, it is important to understand the risks and benefits of taking versus not taking preventive antibiotics. You should discuss these issues with your healthcare provider before the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the lining of heart chambers or valves with bacteria, fungi, or other organisms. IE occurs most commonly in people who have abnormal heart valves or had previous heart surgery; less commonly, it can occur in otherwise healthy people who have do not have heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>IE develops following a sequence of events:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria circulate in the bloodstream and stick to the lining or valves of the heart, usually at a site of previous injury or surface irregularity or abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bacteria then grow on the valve surface, forming a small mass (called a vegetation) on the heart valves or lining. The valve or surface that is infected may then become secondarily damaged.</p><p/><p>IE can develop in a very small percentage of people who undergo dental or other medical procedures that can cause bacteria to be transiently released into the bloodstream. Antibiotics are commonly given to people undergoing dental procedures who have preexisting heart murmurs or known problems with their heart valves, although the evidence that these antibiotics are always necessary or effective is not conclusive. Some studies show that antibiotics can help to prevent IE, while others show no benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, American Heart Association guidelines recommended that most patients with a heart murmur receive antibiotics prior to almost any dental procedure, even minor ones. However, these guidelines have changed considerably over time as more information has become available about the actual risk of dental procedures for patients with heart conditions. Review of studies performed between 1950 and 2006, which included thousands of patients, has shown that there was no benefit of using preventive antibiotics, except in the highest risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-before-procedures-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Highest risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with the following conditions are considered to be at the highest risk of developing IE.

However, active dental infections in patients with prosthetic joints should be treated promptly, and good oral hygiene should be maintained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380762914\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with breast implants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data to support administration of prophylactic antibiotics to women with prosthetic breast implants prior to dental procedures, and we do not recommend it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women who are at highest risk for IE (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Highest risk'</a> above) should take an antibiotic before certain dental, oral, or upper respiratory tract procedures.</p><p>A pregnant woman who has a high risk of IE does <strong>NOT</strong> usually need antibiotic prophylaxis before a normal vaginal delivery or cesarean section.
