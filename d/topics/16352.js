Biliary sphincterotomy refers to the cutting of the biliary sphincter and is typically carried out during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The principal indications for sphincterotomy include removal of common bile duct stones, treatment of papillary stenosis, and facilitation of endotherapy (ie, stent placement, tissue sampling, and stricture dilation).</p><p>Sphincterotomy is a technically complex procedure that is performed under visual and fluoroscopic guidance. Deep cannulation of the bile duct is followed by electrocautery to incise the sphincter of Oddi. This topic review will focus on the technique of endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy. Its clinical applications and complications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: Indications, patient preparation, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SPHINCTEROTOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sphincterotomes (also known as papillotomes) are available with a number of different configurations, which can be broadly categorized as pull, push, and needle-knife. Several modifications are available within each category that are designed for specific clinical settings or anatomic variations. This topic review will focus on the most commonly used sphincterotome (the Erlangen or pull-type version), which consists of a wire-loop partially enclosed in a Teflon catheter. The wire exits the catheter about 3 cm before its distal end and reenters the catheter about 3 mm from its tip. The portion of the catheter distal to the reentry point is referred to as the &quot;nose.&quot; When the wire is tightened, the tip of the catheter is bowed so that the exposed wire is brought away from the catheter. There are also sphincterotomes available that can rotate (Autotome Rx, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) and may facilitate better sphincterotome and cutting wire orientation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nose length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pull-type sphincterotomes are available with long and short noses. Compared with the long-nosed devices, the short-nosed devices are more responsive to bowing, provide more control during sphincterotomy, and often do not require deep cannulation before the cutting wire exits the endoscope. However, they are more likely to become inadvertently dislodged from the bile duct. With the widespread (nearly universal) use of multilumen sphincterotomes and over the wire sphincterotomies, the long-nose devices are now rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diathermy wire</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another variable distinguishing sphincterotomes is the length of the exposed wire, which ranges from 15 to 40 mm. Devices with longer wires follow the natural curve of the endoscope and elevator, and are more likely to enter the papilla in the correct orientation. However, the longer length of wire may not always be an advantage since the ideal transfer of energy occurs when a short segment of cutting wire is applied to sphincter tissue. The most commonly used cutting wires are 25 and 30 mm long. To limit contact of the cutting wire with the endoscope channel, one sphincterotome has insulation covering the proximal one-half (CleverCut, Olympus).</p><p>The diathermy wire can be either braided or monofilament. Most endoscopists prefer the monofilament wire, since it provides a cleaner incision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of lumens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of multi-lumen sphincterotomes has been a major advance; double and triple lumen sphincterotomes are available. In the case of the former, contrast can be injected via the second lumen, which can also be used for guidewire placement. With the triple lumen variety, contrast can be injected without removing the guidewire. A cannulation catheter can be exchanged for a sphincterotome over a guidewire with duct access maintained throughout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDEWIRES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidewires used for sphincterotomy must be electrically nonconductive. Teflon-sheathed, rather than Teflon-coated, guidewires are preferred since they may be less likely to short-circuit as a result of surface imperfections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, a theoretical concern about most metal-core guidewires is that they have the potential to produce unacceptably high current levels when damaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite this concern, there has been no convincing evidence that non-wire guided sphincterotomy is safer than wire-guided sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Wires commonly used for sphincterotomy include the regular, inexpensive Teflon-coated guidewire, the basic Teflon-sheathed wire (glide wire), and other more expensive Teflon-sheathed wires (eg, Jaguar, Dream, Visi-Glide, and Metro) that are easier to use for stent placement compared with the glide wire because of their stiffness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROSURGICAL GENERATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrical current is applied to the diathermy wire via a standard electrosurgical cautery generator. Sphincterotomes are usually monopolar, thereby requiring grounding pads to complete the electrical circuit. High frequency electrical current can be applied either as pure-cut, pure-coagulation, or a blend of the two. Pure-coagulation current during sphincterotomy may increase the risk of pancreatitis, while pure-cut current appears to be associated with a higher rate of bleeding. As a result, most endoscopists blend cutting with coagulation current. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High frequency current is required for sphincterotomy. It is typically delivered by conventional generators (electrosurgical units; ESUs) that use constant wattage (eg, Valleylab, Olympus). A potential problem with these devices may occur from variations in voltage, which cause changes in thermal effects. As the wire coagulates the tissue, the tissue resistance rises. It is important to appreciate that voltage is the primary determinant of thermal damage. From Ohm's law:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; P = V x C (power = voltage x current)</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; C = <span class=\"nowrap\">V/r</span> (current = <span class=\"nowrap\">voltage/resistance)</span></p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Thus P = V x <span class=\"nowrap\">V/r</span> or r x P = V(2)</p></div></div><p>These equations illustrate that with conventional (constant power) ESUs, as resistance rises, so does voltage. These units deliver low voltage at low resistance (such as during the start of the cut or open-air activation), and high voltage at high resistance. This explains how a &quot;zipper cut&quot; may occur. Resistance continues to rise at a local point in contact with the wire. The ESU delivers higher amounts of voltage while tension is applied to the diathermy wire by bowing the sphincterotome. When the wire breaks through, there is a very short period when the wire is cutting through low resistance tissue at high voltage, potentially leading to a runaway cut.</p><p>These principles also illustrate how excessive thermal injury may occur. As mentioned above, current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance, so resistance is inversely proportional to current while voltage is directly proportional. If voltage is constant (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'ERBE generators'</a> below), then as resistance rises, current falls off. The current level must be high at the start of the cut to establish the electrical arcs needed to cut tissue. As the cut proceeds, the current should decrease. However, with conventional units, the voltage variation that accompanies these factors can cause excessive coagulation (thermal injury). A greater degree of thermal injury occurs at higher voltages with conventional units.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Author's setting preferences for conventional generators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A randomized prospective study found that a pure-cut current was associated with a lower frequency of pancreatitis compared with a blended current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. No difference in the relative risk of bleeding was reported, possibly because of an insufficient number of patients studied.</p><p>We perform the first third of the sphincterotomy with the generator in the &quot;cut&quot; setting, the middle third with blended current, and the final third using coagulation current. The rationale for the above is as follows: The risk of causing pancreatitis may be highest during the initial portion of the sphincterotomy, whereas the risk of causing bleeding may be highest near the apex of the sphincterotomy (because of the proximity of the pancreatic orifice and blood vessels, respectively). The cut setting is used initially to rapidly (and presumably with minimal thermal injury) cut away from the pancreatic orifice. Blended current is used for the middle portion of the cut since, at this point, the risks of pancreatitis and bleeding may be lowest. The sphincterotomy is completed with coagulation current because at this point, the risk of bleeding is highest. The above recommendations are based upon our experience. Many experts perform the entire sphincterotomy using the blended current setting only. In addition, many endoscopy units (including the author's) now perform sphincterotomy solely using the ERBE generator instead of standard ESUs. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'ERBE generators'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">ERBE generators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ERBE generator (ERBE USA Inc, Atlanta, GA) accomplishes its tasks by using constant voltage rather than constant wattage. Unlike conventional electrosurgical generators, it does not permit voltage to build and wane in response to changes in tissue impedance. The wattage is adjusted up to 1100 times per second. Since voltage is the principal determinant of thermal injury during sphincterotomy, the ERBE delivers more predictable and reproducible cutting effects and less overall thermal injury.</p><p>The &quot;endocut&quot; mode delivers energy with fractionated, intermittent pulses of current, resulting in cutting with hemostasis. The generator automatically turns on and off so that the cut takes place in short stages. It has been hypothesized that the continuous, controlled interchange between precise cutting and coagulation may decrease the incidence of bleeding, since overly rapid cutting does not take place. Some experts believe that the incidence of pancreatitis and perforation may be decreased since excessive coagulation is avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although a similar process can be achieved by intermittently pressing the foot pedal, this method provides relatively little control over the length and effectiveness of cutting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest a possible advantage of the ERBE generator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] over conventional generators. A randomized study involving 100 patients found the risk of bleeding was less with ERBE than with a conventional unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There was no difference in incision length or pancreatitis. However, abrupt opening of the papillary roof was more frequently observed with the conventional generator than with ERBE. In a large study of 2711 consecutive sphincterotomies (1218 using the Valleylab generator and 1091 the ERBE generator), there was an increase in endoscopically observed bleeding with the Valleylab generator. No significant differences were noted in terms of clinically evident bleeding or pancreatitis between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In a meta-analysis of four prospective randomized trials comparing pure current with mixed current (endocut or blended), there was no difference in the rate of pancreatitis, but there was significantly more bleeding in the pure current than in the mixed current group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPIC TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340759449\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep cannulation is a prerequisite prior to sphincterotomy, though in some cases a precut papillotomy may be required to gain access to the biliary tree. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-access-papillotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut (access) papillotomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut sphincterotomy: Another perspective on indications and techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Care should be taken not to overfill the biliary tree because of the risk of sepsis if bile is infected. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glucagon</a> rather than air insufflation should be used to diminish duodenal motility.</p><p>Sphincterotomy is commonly performed with the endoscope in the short-position, although the long-position is preferred by some. Bowing of the sphincterotome is usually required to force the wire upward toward the roof of the papilla. This maneuver can be facilitated by using the elevator and the up-down deflecting knobs. However, the short scope position together with the tendency of sphincterotomes to twist in a clockwise direction while bowing may result in unsafe conditions. Ampullary distortion may result in increased area exposure and excessive coagulation. The position of the papilla combined with the clockwise rotation of the wire tends to send the cut in the pancreatic direction, &quot;the 2 o'clock position.&quot; This can be corrected by adjusting the <span class=\"nowrap\">left/right</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(L/R)</span> knobs and twisting or torquing the scope to the left, but it is most effectively corrected by assuming a semi-long scope position. In this position, minimal bowing is necessary and the incision can be observed from above.</p><p>A sphincterotomy should be created between the 11 and 1 o'clock position. Following deep cannulation, the endoscopist can withdraw the sphincterotome, tailoring it to the incision length. Generally, about one-half to two-thirds of the wire should be visible in the duodenum. It is important that the sphincterotomy be performed without too much wire in the papilla to prevent an uncontrolled &quot;zipper cut&quot; and resulting retroperitoneal perforation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Electrosurgical generators'</a> above.)</p><p>The sphincterotomy length should be tailored to the indication and to duct size and local anatomy. The incision should be directed along the longitudinal axis of the intramural segment of the common bile duct and should never be continued beyond the junction of the intramural segment of the bile duct and the duodenal wall. This landmark is identified by locating where the superior margin of the bulging impression of the intramural bile duct meets the duodenal wall. Relying on the horizontal fold to denote this landmark may be inaccurate, and these folds can often be transected without consequence. A 75 percent bowed sphincterotome or an inflated stone balloon can be used to assess sphincterotomy size. Both of these devices should be able to move easily in and out of the orifice if an adequate sphincterotomy has been created.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Billroth II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sphincterotomy in patients who have undergone a partial gastrectomy with Billroth II anastomosis poses a special challenge. However, in experienced hands, it is usually successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Since the papilla is upside down, the bile duct is cannulated by orienting the catheter downwards in the six o'clock position. There are two major techniques for performing sphincterotomy in this situation. The first involves stenting the bile duct and then using a needle-knife to cut over the stent. The incision is continued along the stent towards the junction of the intramural segment and the duodenal wall (in the six o'clock position). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after Billroth II reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A reverse sphincterotome can also be used. These sigmoid loop sphincterotomes are designed so that the diathermy wire is oriented towards the six rather than the 12 o'clock position. However, in practice, reverse sphincterotomes often do not orient correctly. Thus, we prefer the freehand technique described above. In addition, some endoscopists report success using the rotatable sphincterotome. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sphincterotomes'</a> above.)</p><p>In difficult cannulations, a needle-knife fistulotomy can be created with subsequent antegrade passage of a guidewire across the ampulla. The fistulotomy can then be extended using a wire guided sphincterotome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Periampullary diverticulum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sphincterotomy may be more difficult in presence of a periampullary diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-biliary-sphincterotomy-technique-the-cutting-edge/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incision can usually be continued to the edge of the diverticulum. However, the size of the sphincterotomy may need to be limited since it is sometimes difficult to visualize the incision. When the papilla and bile duct are located within the partition (ie, a pantaloon diverticulum), it is usually possible to visualize the whole papilla during sphincterotomy, permitting a larger incision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340759396\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary sphincterotomy refers to the cutting of the biliary sphincter and is typically carried out during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
