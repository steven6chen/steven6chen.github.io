He or she will compare your child's blood pressure to the blood pressure of other children of the same age, sex, and height. If your child's blood pressure is much greater than the blood pressure of other children of the same age, sex, and height, your doctor or nurse will check it again on one or more other days.</p><p>Children have high blood pressure if their blood pressure is much greater than that of other children on 3 or more different days. Another word for high blood pressure is &quot;hypertension.&quot;</p><p>Some children have a condition called &quot;elevated blood pressure.&quot; These children have blood pressure that is somewhat higher than normal, but is not yet hypertension. Doctors used to call this &quot;prehypertension.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240667270\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High blood pressure does not usually cause any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240667277\"><span class=\"h1\">Why does my child have high blood pressure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, high blood pressure is caused by a medical condition. Other times, there is no known cause. High blood pressure can run in families.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will want to figure out if a medical condition is causing your child's high blood pressure. He or she will talk with you and do an exam. During the exam, he or she will check the blood pressure in your child's arms and legs. Your doctor or nurse might also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasounds of the kidneys, or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240667284\"><span class=\"h1\">Why does high blood pressure need to be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High blood pressure needs to be treated, because it can lead to future problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with high blood pressure can have high blood pressure as adults. Adults with high blood pressure have a greater chance of having a heart attack or stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A few children with very high blood pressure can have seizures or heart failure. Heart failure is a type of heart problem in which the heart cannot pump normally.</p><p/><p>The goal of treatment is to reduce your child's high blood pressure until it is at a normal level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240667291\"><span class=\"h1\">How is high blood pressure treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, doctors treat any medical conditions that might be causing the high blood pressure.</p><p>But treating the cause does not always reduce high blood pressure. Or there might not be a known cause. In these cases, high blood pressure is treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240667298\"><span class=\"h1\">What lifestyle changes might be part of treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lifestyle changes that might be part of treatment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight (if your child is overweight) &ndash; Your doctor or nurse might recommend that you work with a &quot;nutritionist.&quot; A nutritionist is an expert on food and eating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet changes, such as eating healthier foods or reducing the amount of salt in your child's food. Healthy foods include fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting regular exercise &ndash; Most children should get &quot;aerobic&quot; exercise for 20 to 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. Aerobic exercise includes activities such as walking, running, swimming, or biking. The doctor or nurse will tell you if there are activities your child should not do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not spending a lot of time sitting, watching TV, or playing computer games</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoking or drinking alcohol &ndash; Doctors also recommend that family members not smoke.
