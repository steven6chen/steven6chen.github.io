The pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of a related or unrelated donor. Umbilical cord blood (UCB), the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of an infant, has emerged as an established alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic HCT.</p><p>Engraftment and survival rates following HCT are optimized when the donor and recipient are genetically compatible. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors are generally the preferred donor source for an allogeneic HCT. Unfortunately, finding an HLA-matched sibling is not always possible. Each full sibling potential donor has only a 25 percent chance of being fully HLA-matched with a sibling requiring a transplant. Therefore, most patients do not have an HLA-identical relative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Matched sibling donors'</a>.)</p><p>When a suitable related donor is not available, a search is conducted to identify a potential unrelated HLA-matched donor. Finding an appropriate donor through a national registry is a lengthy process that is not always successful, especially for individuals who are not of Northern European descent. Haploidentical donors have also emerged as an alternative source. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Unrelated donors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In comparison, the relative ease of procurement and the lower than anticipated risk of severe acute graft-versus-host disease has made unrelated UCB transplantation a possible alternative to unrelated donor bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant. The increased representation of ethnic minorities and the ability to use partially HLA-matched UCB units significantly expands the donor pool. In addition, the use of reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative preparative regimens to allow engraftment of UCB broadens the scope of patients who may benefit from allogeneic HCT, including elderly and medically infirm patients without an HLA-matched sibling donor.</p><p>The advantages and limitations of UCB and the selection of an umbilical cord blood graft are discussed here. Other issues related to UCB are discussed separately, including the use of UCB transplantation in adults using myeloablative and non-myeloablative preparative regimens, and the collection, storage, and ethical issues regarding the use of UCB for HCT.

Likewise, the storage of UCB avoids the risk of donor attrition. Together, these characteristics result in a considerably faster time to UCBT than that seen with an unrelated BM or PBPC graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In addition, there is a reduced likelihood of transmitting infections (eg, cytomegalovirus) from the donor to the recipient.</p><p/><p>The main limitations of UCB as a hematopoietic stem cell source are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased risk of graft failure &ndash; UCB contains limited numbers of hematopoietic progenitors and outcomes after transplant correlate with cell dose as a function of the recipient&rsquo;s body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As such, single UCB samples frequently do not contain sufficient hematopoietic progenitor cells to allow for the reconstitution of the bone marrow of a large child or adult. (See <a href=\"#H61604500\" class=\"local\">'Cell dose'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed immune reconstitution &ndash; Infectious complications are common after UCBT, largely due to a delay in the time to neutrophil recovery and delayed acquired immune reconstitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When compared with transplants of unrelated donor bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells, UCBT is associated with a longer median duration of neutropenia (approximately 30 versus 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

A retrospective analysis of 778 patients who received UCBT between 1992 and 2008 reported cumulative incidence rates of autoimmune disease of 5 and 7 percent at one and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The most common autoimmune disorders were autoimmune hemolytic anemia (20 patients), immune thrombocytopenia (11 patients), and Evans Syndrome (9 patients). The incidence was higher among patients transplanted for non-malignant diseases.</p><p/><p>UCBT from a related or unrelated donor is a well-accepted hematopoietic source in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies, marrow failure, or metabolic syndromes; but in adults, there remain concerns about engraftment and immune reconstitution. The known limited numbers of hematopoietic progenitors and the correlation of cell dose with outcome make its use in adults more problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Furthermore, the majority of reported UCBT involved the use of myeloablative preparative regimens that are known to be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Despite having suitable UCB donors, many older patients and patients with co-morbidities will be precluded from receiving UCBT because of the unacceptable toxicities from the standard conditioning regimens. Methods to overcome these two concerns led to the studies of combined cord blood units and the use of non-myeloablative preparative regimens described in more detail below. In addition, initial studies suggest that expansion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicotinamide-niacinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicotinamide</a> or ex vivo fucosylation of cord blood cells can accelerate the engraftment of neutrophils and platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Outside the setting of a clinical trial, an acceptable approach is to choose UCB units with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The closest HLA match &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;4/6</span> HLA match (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1) or <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;4/8</span> match (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1) (see <a href=\"#H61604493\" class=\"local\">'HLA type'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate cell dose &ndash; &ge;3 x 10<sup>7</sup> nucleated <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> or &ge;2 x 10<sup>5</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> (see <a href=\"#H61604500\" class=\"local\">'Cell dose'</a> below)</p><p/><p>If there<sup> </sup>is no single unit with<sup> </sup>these characteristics then two units<sup> </sup>with a combined total<sup> </sup>dose of &ge;3 x 10<sup>7</sup> nucleated <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> and, if possible, not<sup> </sup>more than one HLA difference<sup> </sup>between the two units and the patient may be acceptable. Many centers preferentially use double cord units for transplantation. Each unit used for double UCBT should have a cell dose &gt;2 x 10<sup>7</sup> nucleated <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span>. In patients without malignant disease, the cell doses should be higher or the HLA incompatibility lower. (See <a href=\"#H61604507\" class=\"local\">'Combined cord blood units'</a> below.)</p><p>Some centers identify and reserve a &quot;backup graft&quot; to be used in the case of unexpected problems with the selected UCB unit when it thaws or if it fails to engraft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In such settings, a unit is reserved at the UCB bank (but not shipped) until the patient has engrafted. After engraftment, the reservation is cancelled and the &quot;backup graft&quot; can be reserved for another patient. Although controversial, the collection of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells as a &quot;backup graft&quot; for patients at higher risk of graft failure does not appear to be necessary, especially in patients with a 6 of 6 HLA-match who are undergoing myeloablative UCB transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61604493\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Matching donor and recipient for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (-A, -B, and -C) and class II (-DRB1 and -DQ) haplotypes is a key part of successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Among patients undergoing unrelated donor bone marrow (BM) or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) HCT, there is a progressive decrease in post-HCT survival with each HLA allele mismatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this setting, molecular typing of 10 HLA alleles is preferred by most centers and acceptable donors are generally limited to no more than a single HLA mismatch. Initial studies suggested that the relative immaturity of the immune system in UCB samples allows for the crossing of immunologic barriers that would otherwise be prohibitive. Even so, HLA-matching is one of the most important factors in UCB unit selection and the best HLA-matched unit(s) is preferred. The importance of matching for KIR ligand status and HLA matching between UCB units in the setting of double UCB transplant is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike in the setting of unrelated donor BM or PBPC HCT, most UCB banks evaluate UCB samples using serologic testing for HLA-A and HLA-B and molecular typing for HLA-DRB1. Using this method, units that are matched at 4, 5, or 6 of 6 HLA alleles are potentially acceptable sources. UCB units with HLA-disparities equal to 3 of 6 or fewer are <strong>not</strong> acceptable since transplantation of such units results in high treatment related mortality (TRM) and low rates of disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22</a>]. When available, additional matching for HLA-C improves patient outcomes.</p><p>The importance of HLA-matching of UCB was best demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of 803 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who received an unrelated UCBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of TRM was increased for patients mismatched at two (hazard ratio [HR] 3.27, 95% CI 1.42-7.54), three (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.4-7.71), or four (HR 3.51, 95% CI 1.44-8.58) loci when compared with patients who were fully matched at 8 loci.

They also suggest that increased UCB cell dose may partially compensate for the negative impact of increasing HLA-disparity. Similar results were noted in a retrospective study of 1525 adults who underwent HCT for acute leukemia, 165 of whom received UCBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients who received 4, 5, or 6 of 6 HLA-matched UCB had similar LFS rates to those who received 8 of 8 HLA-matched BM or PBPCs. Although treatment related mortality was higher among those receiving an UCBT, rates of acute and chronic GVHD were lower than after BM or PBPC transplantation. </p><p>The direction of the HLA allele mismatch also appears to affect the rate of engraftment and the strength of a graft-versus-tumor effect. A retrospective analysis of 1202 recipients of a single cord blood unit transplant analyzed the outcomes among 98 <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> pairs that had unidirectional mismatches only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The 58 patients with unidirectional mismatches in the graft-versus-host direction had significantly faster rates of engraftment. Patients in this subset who had hematologic malignancies also demonstrated rates of treatment failure, transplant-related mortality, and overall mortality that were similar to those seen with matched cord blood units. In contrast, patients with unidirectional mismatches in the host-versus-graft direction had slower engraftment, higher rates of graft failure, and higher relapse rates. Another study demonstrated increased rates of graft failure, treatment-related mortality, and inferior survival among patients receiving double UCB with mismatches in the host-versus-graft direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, a third study demonstrated that transplant recipients who have donor specific anti-HLA antibodies prior to reduced intensity conditioning and transplantation have a higher rate of graft failure and a trend towards decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>When evaluating potential UCB units for selection, efforts should be made to choose the unit(s) with the greatest similarity in HLA haplotype to the recipient. If an 8 of 8 HLA matched unit is not available, an at least 4 of 8 HLA-matched unit is an acceptable alternative. Priority is given to unidirectional mismatches in the graft-versus-host direction and mismatches in the host-versus-graft direction are avoided, if possible. Other issues related to HLA matching of UCB include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-C haplotype &ndash; Initial studies of UCB did not consider the HLA-C haplotype in the selection of UCB due to initial studies that suggested no impact of HLA-C matching on outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The importance of typing at HLA-C was further demonstrated in an analysis of 1568 recipients of single UCB units that showed the lowest transplant-related mortality in those with allele level matching at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 and increased transplant-related mortality and decreased neutrophil recovery with increased HLA disparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Units with normal hemoglobin analysis and those with AF are acceptable. If other UCB units are not available for an individual, the use of UCB units that are heterozygous for either sickle cell trait or thalassemia (but not both) may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of stored unit &ndash; There are limited published data regarding the effect of storage duration on outcomes after UCB transplantation, although older stored cord blood units appear to function equally well.

(See <a href=\"#H61604472\" class=\"local\">'Demand for cord blood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unrelated UCB offers many practical advantages over unrelated donor bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells as a source of hematopoietic stem cells including an expanded donor pool, ease of procurement and lack of donor attrition, and decreased graft-versus-host disease. (See <a href=\"#H61604479\" class=\"local\">'Advantages and limitations of cord blood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations to UCB include an increased risk of graft failure, delayed immune reconstitution, and unavailability of the donor for additional donations (ie, donor lymphocyte infusions). (See <a href=\"#H61604479\" class=\"local\">'Advantages and limitations of cord blood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main criteria for selecting UCB unit(s) for transplantation are the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype and the cryopreserved total nucleated cell dose per kilogram recipient body weight. Outside the setting of a clinical trial, an acceptable approach is to choose UCB units with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The closest HLA match &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;4/6</span> HLA match (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1) or <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;4/8</span> match (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1) (see <a href=\"#H61604493\" class=\"local\">'HLA type'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adequate cell dose &ndash; &ge;3 x 10<sup>7</sup> nucleated <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> or &ge;2 x 10<sup>5</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> (see <a href=\"#H61604500\" class=\"local\">'Cell dose'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is no single unit with these characteristics then two units with a combined total dose of &ge;3 x 10<sup>7</sup> nucleated <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> and, if possible, not more than one HLA difference between the two units and the patient may be acceptable. In patients without malignant disease, the cell doses should be higher or the HLA incompatibility lower. (See <a href=\"#H61604507\" class=\"local\">'Combined cord blood units'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors that may influence UCB unit selection include the bank of origin, the red blood cell content, age of the stored unit, and screening for infectious and hematologic diseases.
