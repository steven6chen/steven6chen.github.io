FL virtually always has a growth pattern that is partially follicular, giving it a nodular appearance both grossly and microscopically. It is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs, defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of FL will be reviewed here. The pathobiology and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately.

FL occurs in all races and all geographic locations, but the exact worldwide incidence of FL is not known, as epidemiologic data are limited in some countries by a lack of resources that are needed for case ascertainment and accurate diagnosis. As a consequence, most epidemiologic data come from retrospective analyses of patients treated at major centers in the United States and Europe.</p><p>In the United States as a whole, FL accounts for approximately 35 percent of NHLs and has an estimated incidence of 3.18 cases per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The estimated incidence in Europe is 2.18 cases per 100,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence is stable over time, but varies by ethnicity, with the incidence in Whites being more than twice that in Black and Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. FL appears to be less common in Central and South America, where it accounts for approximately 20 percent of NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is no strong sex predilection. The incidence increases with age; FL most frequently presents in middle-aged individuals and the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Rarely, FL arises in children or adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> below.)</p><p>While numerous potential risk factors have been proposed, most have not been validated in independent studies. As such, there is a lack of consensus regarding risk factors for the development of FL. A small number of cases appear to be familial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. While the risk of developing FL is slightly increased among relatives of persons with FL, the absolute risk remains low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Approximately 85 percent of patients with FL have t(14;18), which results in the overexpression of B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (<em>BCL2</em>), an oncogene that blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis), leading to prolonged cell survival. However, it is clear that multiple genetic events are required for the development of FL since the t(14;18) translocation can be identified in a small subset of B cells in reactive lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood in a sizable fraction of normal individuals, few of whom will go on to develop FL. The pathogenesis of FL is discussed in more detail separately.

The adenopathy commonly waxes and wanes spontaneously, but does not altogether disappear. While hilar and mediastinal nodes are often involved, large mediastinal masses are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some patients present with relatively asymptomatic large abdominal masses with or without evidence of gastrointestinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary tract obstruction. Staging studies usually demonstrate widely disseminated disease with overt involvement of the spleen, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow in approximately 40, 50, and 60 to 80 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Despite the presence of widespread disease at diagnosis, most patients are asymptomatic other than for lymph node enlargement. Only approximately 20 percent presents with B symptoms (ie, fevers, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There are no characteristic laboratory abnormalities specifically associated with FL and, despite the large tumor burden, fewer than 25 percent of patients present with an increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or cytopenias in the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Staging of lymphoma and the definitions of systemic symptoms associated with lymphoma are presented separately.

Central nervous system involvement is rare, but peripheral nerve compression and epidural tumor masses causing cord compression may develop. Other patients have disease localized to the small intestine, most commonly the second portion of the duodenum, frequently identified as an incidental finding during endoscopy performed for other reasons. The morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic features of such &quot;primary intestinal follicular lymphomas&quot; are similar to those of nodal FL.

Unlike normal lymph nodes, the nodules in FL are typically closely packed and vary in size and shape. There is often artifactual cracking around the nodules in tissue sections, presumably because the follicles lack the normal stromal elements that surround and support reactive follicles. When necessary, staining for follicular dendritic cells (eg, CD21, CD23) can aid in the identification of follicular growth patterns. </p><p>The neoplastic follicles may be present throughout the tumor tissue, or only a portion, with a diffuse component occupying the rest of the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79473\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79473 \">picture 3</a>). Similar to normal germinal centers, T cells and tightly organized meshworks of follicular dendritic cells are present within the malignant follicles; however, unlike in normal follicles, so-called tingible body macrophages (cells laden with the remnants of B cells that have died by apoptosis) are typically absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Neoplastic follicles also lack polarization into centroblast-rich dark zones and centrocyte-rich light zones, which is a feature of normal reactive germinal centers.</p><p>The interfollicular areas of FLs, although compressed, also resemble normal lymph nodes in that large numbers of normal T cells are often located there, mixed with variable numbers of neoplastic cells. The Ki-67+ fraction, a marker of proliferation, is generally lower in neoplastic follicles than it is in reactive follicles. The number of Ki-67+ cells and mitotic figures increases with grade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85889\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85889 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85887 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>Rarely, biopsy of involved tissue demonstrates a diffuse infiltration of tumor cells without a nodular growth pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most of these cases are thought to represent a sampling error in which a small biopsy misses areas of nodular growth. A diagnosis of FL may be made in these cases if other criteria for the diagnosis are present, including a classic immunophenotype (ie, germinal center cell phenotype) and genetic features (ie, 14;18 translocation) associated with FL. A minority will represent the provisional entity &ldquo;predominantly diffuse FL with 1p36 deletion,&rdquo; which lacks BCL2 rearrangement and often presents with a localized inguinal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor is composed of follicle center cells, usually a mixture of centrocytes and centroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63064 \">picture 8B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centrocytes (cleaved follicle center cells) are small to medium sized cells with elongated or cleaved nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant pale cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74837 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centroblasts (noncleaved follicle center cells) are large cells with round or oval nuclei, vesicular chromatin, often multiple peripheral nucleoli and a narrow rim of basophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74413 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p>Centrocytes typically predominate in FL; centroblasts are usually in the minority, but by definition are always present.

Bone marrow examination is an important component of staging, but is not a reliable means of primary diagnosis.</p><p>In classic cases, the histologic appearance of FL is so characteristic that it is one of the few forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that pathologists can diagnose based on morphology alone. Typically, the tumor has a distinctly nodular growth pattern and is comprised of a mixture of centrocytes and centroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85888\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85888 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85890\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85890 \">picture 8A</a>).

Also, on rare occasions, FL has an entirely diffuse growth pattern. In these situations, the diagnosis is based on a combination of morphologic and immunophenotypic findings. The diagnosis can also be made by fine needle aspiration of involved lymph nodes, with the caveat that it does not allow for assessment of growth pattern, and that grading is problematic. With this modality, immunophenotypic analysis (generally carried out by flow cytometry) plays a central role in establishing the diagnosis.</p><p>Characteristically, the tumor cells express monotypic immunoglobulin light chain, CD19, CD20, CD10, and BCL-6, and are negative for CD5 and CD23. The vast majority (&gt;85 percent) of tumors express BCL-2 as a result of a t(14;18), which can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrafollicular neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrafollicular <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/&quot;in</span> situ&quot; follicular neoplasia is a pathologic diagnosis used to describe the identification of follicles, typically several in number, that have a high content of <em>BCL2</em>-rearrangement-positive B cells within a lymph node that otherwise lacks the diagnostic features of FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26</a>].

There are no foci of diffuse involvement. Rearrangements of <em>BCL2</em>, <em>BCL6</em>, and <em>MYC</em> are absent. By contrast, these tumors are often associated with activating mutations involving <em>MAP2K1</em> (a <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinase) and <em>TNFRSF14</em>, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/24,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,74,75</a>]. </p><p>Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma should be distinguished from the more aggressive provisional entity &ldquo;large B-cell lymphoma with <em>IRF4</em> rearrangement&rdquo; which can also present in children and young adults with a follicular growth pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The latter is particularly relevant with unusual FL variants that exhibit plasmacytic or &quot;monocytoid B cell&quot; differentiation. In addition the identification of histologic transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma is extremely important. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of peripheral adenopathy in adults is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of patients presenting with primary intestinal FL includes benign and malignant growths of the gastrointestinal tract.

As such, it can be difficult to distinguish these two entities morphologically. However, subtle differences may be noted. In reactive follicular hyperplasia, histology shows discrete follicles of varying sizes and shapes that are separated from one another by interfollicular regions rich in T cells within the lymph node cortex. By contrast, the neoplastic follicles of FL tend to show little variation in size and shape, and are typically found back-to-back with little interfollicular tissue, throughout the node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69885\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69885 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>In both reactive follicular hyperplasia and FL, T cells and follicular dendritic cells are present; however, tingible body (debris-laden) macrophages are not typically observed in FL but are prominent in reactive follicular hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A further clue is that neoplastic follicles do not exhibit polarization, whereas reactive follicles are typically polarized into centroblast-rich dark zones and centrocyte-rich light zones. In addition, the Ki-67+ fraction is generally lower in FL than in reactive follicles.</p><p>Perhaps the most useful differentiating characteristic is that cytoplasmic staining for BCL-2 protein is strongly positive in almost all grade <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> FL tumors, but universally negative in reactive follicular hyperplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64808\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64808 \">picture 12</a>). However, a high fraction of cutaneous FL, childhood FL, and systemic grade 3 FL tumors do not express BCL-2. As such, the presence of cytoplasmic BCL-2 rules out reactive follicular hyperplasia, but its absence is not as straightforward to interpret.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with FL often present with painless peripheral adenopathy. Extralymphatic tissues can be involved secondarily. In contrast, primary cutaneous lymphomas present in the skin and do not involve other tissues. Primary cutaneous lymphomas of germinal center B cell origin are classified separately as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma. Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphomas typically lack <em>BCL2</em> rearrangements and BCL2 protein expression, which can help to discriminate these tumors from systemic FL. Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma is discussed in more detail separately.

Rarely, FL has an entirely diffuse pattern of growth with cell morphology that resembles MCL. In such cases, immunophenotyping is needed to confirm the diagnosis of FL and exclude MCL and chronic lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/small</span> lymphocytic lymphoma. MCLs with a predominantly mantle zone growth pattern may also take on a nodular appearance, but in contrast to FL, MCL tumor cells express cyclin D1 and CD5, and do not express BCL-6 or CD10.

This is the so-called T cell or histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma. Upon initial evaluation, the infiltrating T cells may resemble the small tumor cells of FL, in which the neoplastic B cells are fewer in number and resemble large centroblasts. Once the T cell origin of the small cells is identified, such cases are best classified as T cell rich large B cell lymphoma, a variant of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

As such, careful examination of the sampled lymph node is key to determining whether a component of DLBCL is present. Discordant histologic features suggest histologic transformation of a previously undiagnosed indolent lymphoma. As an example, a small B cell proliferation may be identified in the bone marrow in a patient with large B cell involvement in a lymph node. The detection of areas of DLBCL within the lymph node denotes transformation to an aggressive phase of disease. This subject is discussed in detail separately.

Response to prior therapies can predict outcome with subsequent therapies. As an example, a patient relapsing five years after initial treatment with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> has a better prognosis than a patient relapsing within two years of receiving multiagent chemotherapy (eg, R-CHOP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

Future models will likely build upon this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor grade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FL tumors are graded on a scale from 1 to 3, and this grade appears to have some prognostic value. There has been poor consensus among pathologists on the determination of the grade of FL. However, the most commonly used grading system is presented above. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Grade'</a> above.)</p><p>The minor differences in clinical behavior and response to treatment have not supported a different treatment approach toward grade 1 versus grade 2 FL. Thus, although the grading system remains in place, for clinical decision making, grade 1 and 2 FL should be approached similarly and considered to be clinically indolent lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In contrast to lower grade FLs, this histologic variant has a lesser tendency to involve the bone marrow or peripheral blood and often presents with larger lymphoid masses. Although the follicular architecture is preserved, the clinical presentation, behavior, and outcome with treatment more closely approximates that of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/93,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,95,96</a>].

It most frequently presents in middle-aged Caucasians. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with FL usually present with painless peripheral adenopathy, often with a long history of waxing and waning lymph node enlargement. Widespread disseminated disease is usually present at baseline, but patients are typically asymptomatic aside from their lymphadenopathy. There are no characteristic laboratory abnormalities and, despite the large tumor burden, the majority has a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, FL arises in children or adolescents. A substantial proportion of these tumors appear to be biologically distinct from typical adult FL. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On histology, a nodular growth pattern and cell morphology consisting of a mixture of centrocytes and centroblasts is characteristic. The proportion of centroblasts found in the sample determines the tumor grade, which has therapeutic implications. Involvement of the bone marrow and peripheral blood is often seen but may not be prominent. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Morphologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tumor cells express monotypic immunoglobulin light chain, CD20 (or CD19), CD10, and BCL-6 and are negative for CD5 and CD23. The vast majority (&gt;85 percent) of tumors express BCL-2. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular genetics can confirm the presence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and the t(14;18) involving <em>BCL2</em>, which is not specific for FL. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Molecular genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of FL is primarily made based upon the evaluation of a lymph node biopsy in a patient who has had a history of waxing and waning lymphadenopathy. In classic cases, the histologic appearance of FL is so characteristic that it is one of the few forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that pathologists can diagnose based on morphology alone. Typically, the tumor has a distinctly nodular growth pattern and is comprised of a mixture of centrocytes and centroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85888\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85888 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85890\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85890 \">picture 8A</a>). However, FL has many less common morphologic variants, and sometimes lymph nodes are only partially involved. In these situations, the diagnosis is based on a combination of morphologic and immunophenotypic findings. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for FL is comprised of other malignant and non-malignant diseases that result in lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86190 \">table 1</a>).

The two best measures of outcome are the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55987 \">table 2</a>) and tumor grade.
