It can be dangerous for both the mother and her baby.</p><p>The placenta is the organ that forms between the mother and her baby during pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>). It brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste. Placental abruption happens when the placenta separates from the mother's uterus before delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15589008\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes placental abruption?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors don't know why some women have a placental abruption.

You should also call if you are in a car accident, fall on your belly, or get hit hard in the belly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15589053\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for placental abruption?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most of the time, your doctor or midwife will be able to tell if you have it by asking about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>But you will likely need an ultrasound. An ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to take pictures of the baby and placenta inside your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15589070\"><span class=\"h1\">How is placental abruption treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the hospital, your doctor or nurse will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take some blood from your arm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the baby's heart rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See if you are having contractions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a small tube, called an &quot;IV,&quot; in a vein so you can get fluids and blood, if you need it.</p><p/><p>Depending on how much of the placenta is affected and how long you have been pregnant, your doctor or nurse might want to deliver the baby as soon as possible. You might deliver through the vagina, or the doctor might do surgery to get the baby out (called a &quot;c-section&quot; or &quot;cesarean delivery.&quot;)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15589085\"><span class=\"h1\">Can placental abruption be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of having placental abruption by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not using illegal drugs, such as cocaine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding situations that might result in a fall or getting hit in the belly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15589100\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have had a placental abruption have a higher-than-normal chance of having a placental abruption in future pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15589115\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
