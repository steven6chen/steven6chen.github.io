When a patient presents with massive hemoptysis, the initial steps are to correctly position the patient, establish a patent airway, insure adequate gas exchange and cardiovascular function, and control the bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These steps are reviewed here. Other aspects of massive hemoptysis (ie, definition, etiologies, diagnostic evaluation, and definitive treatment) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-massive-hemoptysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of massive hemoptysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4655275\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFY WHICH SIDE IS BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial steps in managing a patient with massive hemoptysis are to ensure adequate oxygenation and to determine if the bleeding is coming primarily from one lung and, if so, which side is the primary source. This determination may be difficult. Occasionally, there is a history of lung disease on the bleeding side or there may be a gurgling sound that can be auscultated, or an abnormal sensation on that side. However, many signs are misleading because they occur away from the actual bleeding site. As an example, upper lobe hemorrhage may manifest wheezing, rhonchi, or air space disease in the lower lobe, due to the accumulation of blood in the lower lobe with gravitational pooling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4655266\"><span class=\"h1\">POSITION THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with massive hemoptysis should be immediately placed into a position in which the presumed bleeding lung is in the dependent position. A patient whose right lung is bleeding should be placed in the right-side down decubitus position, whereas a patient whose left lung is bleeding should be placed in the left-side down decubitus position. The purpose of these positions is to protect the nonbleeding lung, since spillage of blood into the nonbleeding lung may prevent gas exchange by blocking the airway with clot or filling the alveoli with blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4655170\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISH A PATENT AIRWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with massive hemoptysis who have significant shortness of breath, poor gas exchange, hemodynamic instability, or rapid ongoing hemoptysis should be intubated with a large bore endotracheal tube (size 8 or greater, if possible). In addition, this should be done early in patients with very little cardiopulmonary reserve. The purpose of the large lumen size is to facilitate interventional and diagnostic bronchoscopy.</p><p>When the bleeding is coming from one lung, it may be possible to protect the nonbleeding lung from spillage by using one of the following techniques for intubation and mechanical ventilation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral lung ventilation is performed by selectively inserting a typical, single lumen endotracheal tube into the mainstem bronchus of the nonbleeding lung. The goal is for the inflated cuff of the endotracheal tube to protect the nonbleeding lung from the spillage of blood. Thus, a patient whose right lung is bleeding should have his or her left mainstem bronchus intubated, whereas a patient whose left lung is bleeding should have his or her right mainstem bronchus intubated. A potential problem with right mainstem bronchial intubation is that the right upper lobe bronchus may become blocked. It may be more difficult to selectively intubate the left mainstem bronchus compared to the right. Unilateral lung ventilation is typically done in the setting of a localizing bronchoscopic exam, since it is essential that the bleeding lung be correctly identified. Unilateral lung ventilation may be combined with use of a bronchial blocker or balloon tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double-lumen endotracheal tubes have two separate passageways and lumens with differing lengths to the bronchial and tracheal orifices and two cuffs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Generally, a left-sided double-lumen tube is preferred over the right-sided tube, as it is technically easier to insert and avoids possible obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus when the bronchial balloon cuff is inflated. With the left-sided tube, the longer (bronchial) lumen terminates within the left main bronchus, while the shorter (tracheal) lumen terminates in the distal trachea. After insertion, the bronchial cuff is inflated within the left main bronchus to prevent blood or secretions passing from one side to the other. A separate cuff is inflated within the trachea, just cephalad to the orifice of the shorter (tracheal) lumen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ideally, correct placement is ascertained by bronchoscopy through the tracheal lumen, using a pediatric bronchoscope. The main carina dividing the right and left main bronchi should be visualized approximately 2 cm distal to the tracheal lumen orifice. The bronchial cuff should be about 5 mm distal to the main carina without herniation across the carina. When the bronchoscope is passed through the longer (bronchial) lumen, the carina between the left upper and lower bronchi should be visible. A chest radiograph is subsequently obtained to assess correct positioning by identifying the radio-opaque strip on the double-lumen tube. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mechanical ventilation using a double-lumen endotracheal tube permits ventilation of both lungs, while preventing the aspiration of blood from one lung to the other. However, the tubes are difficult to insert, especially when patients are bleeding rapidly. Even if the tube is successfully inserted, maintaining its proper position is difficult. Patients typically need to be paralyzed or not moved unless absolutely necessary because the tube easily may shift position if the patient moves, potentially leading to blood spillage or bronchial obstruction. In addition, each lumen is relatively small, which predisposes the tube to becoming obstructed by clots. Often the small lumen does not allow passage of a bronchoscope with an effective suction channel and often necessitates changing to an endotracheal tube with a lumen large enough for diagnostic procedures. Due to these practical limitations, double-lumen endotracheal tubes are usually recommended only for patients who are exsanguinating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asphyxiating from their bleeding and when no other approaches are possible. Personnel need to be experienced in placement and maintenance of double-lumen tubes for safe utilization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4655178\"><span class=\"h1\">ENSURE ADEQUATE GAS EXCHANGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with massive hemoptysis may become hypoxemic, hypercapnic, or both. There are no unique ventilatory strategies for patients with massive hemoptysis. In our clinical practice, we generally deliver volume-targeted breaths using assist control ventilation. However, alternative modes of mechanical ventilation are also acceptable. An approach to establishing initial ventilator settings is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Initiation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4655222\"><span class=\"h1\">ENSURE ADEQUATE CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with massive hemoptysis are typically tachycardic and may become hypotensive. Such patients should be managed with volume resuscitation. Crystalloid intravenous fluids are generally administered first because they are readily available. However, blood products are an appropriate alternative in patients who are coagulopathic, anemic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding rapidly. Patients with massive hemoptysis may also have arrhythmias that are probably a consequence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Arrhythmias are best managed by optimizing gas exchange as described above and then using direct therapy if they persist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4655186\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROL THE BLEEDING AND CORRECT COAGULOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many strategies to control pulmonary hemorrhage. Such approaches may be categorized as nonsurgical or surgical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7235390\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsurgical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsurgical approaches to controlling the bleeding include blood product infusion, bronchoscopy, and arteriography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7235375\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with massive hemoptysis should have all known or suspected coagulation abnormalities rapidly reversed. Those who are receiving an anticoagulant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>) or have an elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or international normalized ratio should receive fresh frozen plasma. Those who are thrombocytopenic should receive a platelet transfusion. Patients who are uremic or taking an antiplatelet agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) may also benefit from transfused platelets. Finally, the administration of recombinant factor VIIa may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of blood products in the critically ill&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recombinant factor VIIa: Clinical uses, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary hemorrhage'</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of bronchoscopic techniques that may control pulmonary hemorrhage, but none have been indisputably proven to be of benefit. They include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, topical medications, laser therapy, and electrocautery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balloon tamponade &ndash; Balloon tamponade involves placement of a 4 Fr 100 cm Fogarty balloon catheter or an alternative device (eg, the Arndt endobronchial blocker) into the segmental or subsegmental bronchus that leads to the bleeding site. The balloon is kept inflated for 24 to 48 hours and then deflated. Once the balloon is deflated, the patient is observed for rebleeding for several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If there is no evidence of rebleeding, the balloon catheter is removed. There are theoretical risks of ischemic mucosal injury and postobstructive pneumonia due to balloon tamponade, but these complications have not been reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iced saline lavage &ndash; To perform iced saline lavage, approximately 1L of saline (eg, twenty 50 mL syringes) should be cooled in ice while the above described goals (ie, patent airway, adequate gas exchange, and adequate cardiovascular function) are being achieved and the bronchoscopy equipment is being set up. Once the saline has cooled, bronchoscopy is performed and the source of bleeding is localized. The bleeding source is then lavaged using 50 mL aliquots of cold saline. In one case series, the average volume of saline used was 500 mL per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is believed that iced saline lavage works by causing local vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow, and promoting hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are no controlled data showing benefit and we use this only very rarely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical medications &ndash; A topical vasoconstrictive agent (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [1:20,000] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>) or a topical coagulant (eg, thrombin or a fibrinogen-thrombin combination) can be infused through a bronchoscope and directly onto the bleeding source to slow or stop the bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These methods have not been compared in trials; however, our clinical experience suggests that topical epinephrine is as effective as or more effective than the alternative topical medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, or cryotherapy may be able to stop the bleeding if bronchoscopy identifies a bleeding mucosal lesion. These techniques can be implemented through a flexible or rigid bronchoscope; however, rigid bronchoscopy is preferable because it has better suction capability and excellent visualization of the bleeding lesion is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoscopic laser in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-electrocautery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial electrocautery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The diagnostic aspects of bronchoscopy in massive hemoptysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-massive-hemoptysis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of massive hemoptysis&quot;, section on 'Bronchoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Arteriography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arteriographic embolization can localize potential bleeding sites and treat the bleeding by embolization. It is generally employed when there is persistent brisk hemoptysis despite correction of coagulopathy and after bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Arteriographic embolization is performed in a radiological suite by an interventional or vascular radiologist. It can be performed in intubated, critically ill patients and, therefore, is useful for patients with a greater severity of illness. Typically abnormal vascular structure is identified. Sometimes dye may collect within a regional airway, but observation of actual bleeding (contrast extravasation) from a specific vessel into the airway is very rare.</p><p>Arteriographic embolization involves focally injecting intravenous contrast material to define the intended arterial circulation (bronchial, pulmonary, or systemic), identifying the potential bleeding site, and then inserting occlusive material into either the bleeding vessel itself or the proximal vessels that supply the bleeding vessel. Routine post-embolization thoracic aortography is sometimes performed to improve the detection of bleeding from the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The bronchial arteries should be the first vessels studied in most patients with massive hemoptysis because they are the most common source of bleeding. Bronchial arteriography has the following limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior spinal artery arises from a bronchial artery in approximately 5 percent of the population. As a result, cannulation or proximal embolization of the bronchial artery may block flow to the anterior spinal cord, resulting in spinal cord ischemia or infarction with paraplegia. Bronchial arteriography should only be performed by experienced operators because the risk of paraplegia is less than 1 percent in experienced hands. Patients should be counseled about this risk as part of the informed consent for the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant amount of anatomic variability in the number and location of the bronchial arteries is common. Most individuals have one or two bronchial arteries on each side and a total of three or four arteries. Bronchial arteries usually arise from the aorta, but sometimes they originate from the intercostal arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is rare for the bleeding rate to be sufficient (ie, &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> for the extravasation of contrast to be visualized by arteriography. Arteriography may demonstrate a focal, tortuous, hypervascularized site, but such findings do not strictly prove that this is the bleeding site. Many chronic inflammatory lung lesions are jointly supplied by hypertrophied bronchial arteries and by collateral systemic arteries arising from the subclavian, axillary, intercostal, phrenic, or other arteries. Bleeding that arises from the systemic arteries will not be visualized by bronchial arteriography.</p><p/><p>The pulmonary arteries are generally studied only if bronchial arteriography does not identify a bleeding source or if there is a high suspicion for arteriovenous malformation (AVMs) or pulmonary embolism. Overall, the pulmonary arteries are the bleeding source in fewer than 10 percent of patients with massive hemoptysis. The usual conditions that cause pulmonary arterial bleeding are pulmonary AVMs, Rasmussen's aneurysms, iatrogenic pulmonary artery tears (eg, perforation from a Swan-Ganz catheter), or rarely pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">embolism/infarction</span> with coagulopathy. The only indication for performing pulmonary arteriography prior to bronchial arteriography is the suspicion of one of these conditions.</p><p>It is uncertain when potential systemic arterial supplies should be evaluated; examining each potential systemic arterial source can be a long and painstaking task that can increase the dye load substantially. Generally speaking, we believe that patients with massive hemoptysis who do not have a bleeding site identified by the combination of bronchoscopy, bronchial arteriography, and pulmonary arteriography should have their relevant systemic arteries examined. In addition, the systemic arteries should be evaluated when there is recurrence of massive hemoptysis, especially if it occurs early after therapeutic embolization. The systemic circulation is involved in as many as 5 to 10 percent of cases of ongoing hemoptysis.</p><p>Arteriographic embolization successfully stops the pulmonary hemorrhage in more than 85 percent of attempted embolizations, especially if the bronchial, pulmonary, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic arterial circulations are well defined during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Early technical failures occur in 5 to 10 percent of attempted embolizations. Examples include the inability to cannulate the bronchial artery and failure to identify <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> embolize all of the collateral systemic feeder vessels (collateral systemic feeder vessels may arise from the gastric, intercostal, internal mammary, renal, or hepatic arteries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/14,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-20</a>]. Rebleeding over the following 6 to 12 months occurs in a significant minority of patients who have undergone embolization (at least 10 to 20 percent); this may be due to incomplete embolization, revascularization, or recanalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/15,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21-24</a>].</p><p>Complications of arteriographic embolization include bronchial wall necrosis and ischemic myelopathy (including paraplegia) due to inadvertent embolization of a spinal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Such complications are uncommon when experienced operators perform the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with unilateral, uncontrollable bleeding should be evaluated by a thoracic surgeon early. The purpose is to expedite surgical intervention later if the bleeding remains brisk despite measures to control it. Patients with massive hemoptysis are generally too ill for routine preoperative physiologic testing (eg, pulmonary function tests); thus, historical data (if available) must be used to estimate the patient's ability to undergo lung resection. Relative contraindications to surgery include severe underlying pulmonary disease, active tuberculosis, diffuse underlying lung disease (eg, cystic fibrosis, multiple AVMs, multifocal bronchiectasis), and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.</p><p>The morbidity and mortality of emergent surgery for persistent massive bleeding are greater than the morbidity and mortality of elective surgery in a nonbleeding patient. In most series of emergent therapy for massive hemoptysis, surgical mortality was approximately 20 percent and surgical morbidity was 25 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, most of these series were reported several decades ago. Data from China and other countries suggest somewhat lower morbidity and mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Common complications of surgery for massive hemoptysis include empyema, bronchopleural fistula, postoperative pulmonary hemorrhage, lung infarction, respiratory insufficiency, wound infection, and hemothorax. Empyema and bronchopleural fistula are especially frequent after emergent surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sequelae-and-complications-of-pneumonectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sequelae and complications of pneumonectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several retrospective cohort studies have compared non-surgical interventions to surgery in patients with massive hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Older studies suggest that surgery has lower mortality, but those studies may have been biased because the highest risk patients were not surgical candidates and were managed with non-surgical interventions. Higher quality studies from the 1980s onward suggest that the mortality associated with non-surgical therapies and surgery are similar among patients who qualified as surgical candidates. However, patients managed non-surgically probably have a higher risk of rebleeding within the first six months.</p><p>Massive hemoptysis is present in a small percentage of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, but since the disease is common, this is not a rare situation. One retrospective review reported outcomes in 125 patients with massive hemoptysis due to non-small cell lung cancer, 87 percent of whom had non-surgical therapy (ie, interventional radiographic embolization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-initial-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In-hospital and one-year survival rates were 69 and 30 percent, respectively. Poor performance status and advanced stage were independent predictors of mortality. Additional indicators included mechanical ventilation and the presence of cavitation or necrosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial steps in managing massive hemoptysis are to ensure adequate gas exchange and to determine which lung is likely bleeding. Patients should be immediately placed into a position in which the lung that is presumed to be bleeding is in the dependent position. (See <a href=\"#H4655275\" class=\"local\">'Identify which side is bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4655266\" class=\"local\">'Position the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with massive hemoptysis who have severe shortness of breath, poor gas exchange, hemodynamic instability, or rapid ongoing hemoptysis, should be intubated, preferably with a large bore endotracheal tube is appropriate. If bleeding is unilateral, it may be possible to protect the nonbleeding lung from spillage by using of one of the following techniques for intubation and mechanical ventilation: unilateral lung ventilation using a standard, single-lumen endotracheal tube advanced into the right or left mainstem bronchus or independent lung ventilation using a double-lumen endotracheal tube. (See <a href=\"#H4655170\" class=\"local\">'Establish a patent airway'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no ventilatory strategies or resuscitation strategies that are unique to patients with massive hemoptysis. (See <a href=\"#H4655178\" class=\"local\">'Ensure adequate gas exchange'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4655222\" class=\"local\">'Ensure adequate cardiovascular function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with massive hemoptysis should have known or suspected coagulation abnormalities rapidly reversed. (See <a href=\"#H7235375\" class=\"local\">'Blood products'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with massive hemoptysis, we suggest flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside as the initial intervention to assess and attempt to control the bleeding, rather than arteriographic embolization or surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Bronchoscopic strategies to control pulmonary hemorrhage include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, administration of a topical vasoconstrictor or a topical coagulant, laser therapy, and electrocautery. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with massive hemoptysis who continue to bleed despite a flexible bronchoscopic intervention and are stable enough to leave the intensive care unit for a procedure, we suggest arteriographic embolization rather than surgery during active bleeding episodes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Arteriography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who continue to bleed despite both a flexible bronchoscopic intervention and arteriographic embolization may benefit from another attempt at bronchoscopic bleeding control via rigid bronchoscopy. If the bleeding cannot be controlled via rigid bronchoscopy, surgery may be the best option. Similarly, patients who continue to bleed despite a flexible bronchoscopic intervention and are too unstable to go to the radiographic suite for a procedure may benefit from this approach.
