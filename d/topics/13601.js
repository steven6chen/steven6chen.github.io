Tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla are termed pheochromocytomas, and secrete catecholamines. Tumors with extra-adrenal origins are called paragangliomas, and either secrete catecholamines or are nonfunctional. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of pheochromocytomas and catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas in children. Given the limited experience with pheochromocytomas in children and the similarity in clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment among children and adults, the following discussion includes some data derived from the adult literature. Detailed reviews of these tumors in adults are presented separately.

Among hypertensive children, the incidence of surgically confirmed pheochromocytoma or catecholamine-secreting paraganglioma ranges from 0.8 to 1.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Approximately 80 percent of catecholamine-secreting tumors are pheochromocytomas and 20 percent are paragangliomas, in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because these tumors are uncommon, most pediatric case series are small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

Patients are also at risk for postoperative hypotension due to chronic vasoconstriction and volume contraction. Medical preparation for surgery is designed to prevent these events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/51,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,72</a>]. Antihypertensive treatment (typically with adrenergic blockade) is recommended for all patients, regardless of whether they have hypertension preoperatively. In a large case series of patients who underwent intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma resection, intraoperative hemodynamic variability was greater with higher preoperative levels of adrenergic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, substantial variability was observed even in patients with adrenergic activity levels within the normal range. Patients with large tumors are particularly at risk for a volatile hemodynamic course and more severe postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha-adrenergic blockade method</strong> &ndash; Although no method of preparation for surgery in children with pheochromocytomas is universally accepted, a common approach is to initiate alpha-adrenergic blockade, followed by beta-adrenergic blockade if needed: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alpha-adrenergic blockade &ndash; In our practice we generally use alpha-adrenergic blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenoxybenzamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenoxybenzamine</a> (Dibenzyline) unless contraindicated because of cardiopulmonary concerns. The starting dose of phenoxybenzamine in children is 0.25 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day or 10 mg once daily; the dose is increased every few days until the patient's symptoms and blood pressure are controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Due to the high cost of phenoxybenzamine, some clinicians may choose to a selective alpha-1 antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">doxazosin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terazosin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">terazosin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prazosin</a>). Typically, alpha-adrenergic blockade is started 7 to 14 days before surgery. Treatment targets include resolution of paroxysmal symptoms and a systolic blood pressure that is in the lower end of the normal range for age. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Volume expansion &ndash; On the second or third day of alpha-adrenergic blockade, patients are encouraged to start a diet high in sodium content because of the catecholamine-induced volume contraction and the orthostasis associated with alpha-adrenergic blockade. This causes intravascular volume expansion, which may be contraindicated in patients with heart failure or renal insufficiency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta-adrenergic blockade &ndash; After adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, which typically occurs two to three days preoperatively, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated if needed to control tachycardia. The beta-adrenergic blocker should <strong>never</strong> be started first because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a further elevation in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The clinician should exercise caution if the patient is asthmatic or has heart failure. Chronic catecholamine excess can produce a cardiomyopathy that may become evident with the initiation of beta-adrenergic blockade, resulting in acute pulmonary edema. Therefore, when the beta-adrenergic blocker is administered, it should be used cautiously and at a low dose. The dose is then increased as necessary to control the tachycardia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In most cases, the patient is ready for surgery in 10 to 14 days after starting the alpha-adrenergic blockade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other methods</strong> &ndash; Although perioperative alpha blockade is widely recommended, a second regimen that has been utilized in adults at the Cleveland Clinic and in France involves the administration of a calcium channel blocker for blood pressure control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. In a review of 113 adult patients who underwent removal of pheochromocytomas, fewer perioperative complications were observed in those not given alpha-adrenergic antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcium channel blockers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A third approach is to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrosine</a> (alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis by blocking the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Metyrosine should be used with caution and only when other agents have been ineffective or if significant tumor manipulation is anticipated. Although some centers have used this agent routinely, most clinicians reserve metyrosine primarily for patients who cannot be treated with the combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade protocol because of intolerance or cardiopulmonary concerns. The starting dose of metyrosine in children is 125 mg (250-mg capsules can be reduced to 125 mg capsules by a pharmacist) once or twice daily, with an increase in dose as required or based on a target decline in fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines (unpublished personal experience). The use of metyrosine is also limited by its high cost.

With removal of all tumor tissue, catecholamine secretion and the blood pressure should fall to normal levels within one week.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery may be performed in patients with unilateral or bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-81</a>]. Paragangliomas usually require an open surgical approach. </p><p>When bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas are present, as sometimes occurs in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115289\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115289 \">image 1</a>), bilateral total laparoscopic adrenalectomy should be considered in patients with MEN2; whereas bilateral cortical sparing adrenalectomy can be considered in non-MEN2 patients. The intent of cortical-sparing adrenalectomy is to leave enough cortex intact to avoid permanent adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/82-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-87</a>]. However, it is important for clinicians and the parents to understand that in the setting of MEN2, the medullary involvement is diffuse and that it is impossible to preserve cortex without also preserving adrenal medulla. In the setting of MEN2 treated with cortical-sparing surgery, diseased medulla is purposely being left behind and over time it may grow large enough to necessitate a second operation. Thus, the risk of cortical-sparing adrenalectomy in patients with MEN2 is recurrent pheochromocytoma, which occurred in 3 of 14 patients (21 percent) in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

In a series of 272 patients (primarily adults) with metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, metastases were present at initial diagnosis in 35 percent (synchronous disease), and the remainder developed during the follow-up period at a median of 5.5 years (range 0.3 to 53.4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Median overall and disease-specific survivals were 24.6 and 33.7 years, respectively. Rapid disease progression was associated with male sex, older age at diagnosis, synchronous metastases, larger tumor size, elevated dopamine, and not undergoing resection of the primary tumor. In children with malignant <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma,</span> the 5-year survival rate is estimated at 78 percent, and the 10-year survival rate is estimated at 31 percent, with mean survival of 157 &plusmn; 32 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Because of the variable clinical course of patients with metastatic disease, an individualized approach is warranted.

Those originating from the adrenal medulla are defined as pheochromocytomas, and non-adrenal tumors are paragangliomas. (See <a href=\"#H1562141623\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1218009649\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presenting symptoms of these tumors in children are paroxysmal or sustained hypertension (60 to 90 percent), episodic sweating, tachycardia or palpitations (50 to 60 percent), headache (50 to 80 percent), and effects related to the abdominal mass; the &quot;classic triad&quot; of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia is an unusual presentation, particularly in children. (See <a href=\"#H77565338\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with adults, these tumors in children are more likely to be familial, multicentric, or malignant. (See <a href=\"#H77565338\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 80 percent of these tumors in children are familial, associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or familial paraganglioma. (See <a href=\"#H2136977427\" class=\"local\">'Familial disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among apparently sporadic (non-familial) tumors, up to 56 percent will have unsuspected germline mutations of the genes involved in the above familial syndromes. Thus, genetic testing is appropriate for any child presenting with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. (See <a href=\"#H2347428061\" class=\"local\">'Sporadic tumors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H98151943\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma is suspected because of suggestive signs or symptoms, or because of a family history in a patient with familial disease. The diagnosis is confirmed by biochemical testing for 24-hour fractionated urinary metanephrines and catecholamines (or plasma fractionated metanephrines), followed by radiographic localization of the tumor with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H2009173079\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H559758555\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3106761337\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients with known mutations for familial pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, annual biochemical screening for the development of pheochromocytoma should begin in early childhood. The optimal screening test for this scenario is plasma fractionated metanephrines.

Typical members of the multidisciplinary team include: pediatricians and internists with expertise with very rare neoplasms, endocrine surgeons, radiologists, geneticists, and anesthesiologists. (See <a href=\"#H1155791937\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection is the primary treatment.

Performing surgery without this medical preparation may provoke hypertensive crises or malignant arrhythmias, which can be fatal. We suggest using the combination of alpha-adrenergic blockade followed by beta-adrenergic blockade, if necessary, rather than another regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
