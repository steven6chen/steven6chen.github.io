However, many people with arthritis do not exercise, often because of joint or muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, or joint swelling. This can lead to loss of joint motion, stiffness, and muscle weakness and tightness. These problems can worsen fatigue and can cause joints to become unstable.</p><p>However, exercise can decrease pain and can enhance quality of life. Exercise is most beneficial if it is done on a regular basis. Most people can find a way to exercise without increasing their symptoms.</p><p>This topic describes the benefits of exercise for people with arthritis, including disease-specific exercise recommendations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SUCCESS WITH EXERCISE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Stick with it</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors can improve the chances of sticking with an exercise program long-term, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following a simple regimen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting attainable goals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding the importance and benefits of exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interacting with others while exercising (ie, with exercise groups)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following up regularly with a health care provider, such as a physical therapist or personal trainer, to provide encouragement and make adjustments to the regimen</p><p/><p>Exercise in a supervised setting may improve the chances of continuing long term, compared with unsupervised, home-based programs. However, people who are self-motivated and exercise at home may enjoy the benefits of equal effectiveness, lower costs, and more convenience.</p><p>Information on general exercise can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits of daily activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people are not interested in a formal exercise program but are able to perform daily activities such as light housework, shopping, gardening, clearing walks and driveways, caring for a child or grandchild, caring for an older person, leisure walking, or exercising in a pool. There are health benefits (largely cardiovascular) from these activities.</p><p>Exercise can be broken up into three or four 10-minute sessions per day; it does not need to be continuous to produce health benefits. Moderate intensity exercise is most effective if it is performed on most days of the week. However, exercising only one or two days per week is better than not exercising at all.</p><p>Benefits of exercise include decreased pain and increased strength, mobility, and fitness, leading to an improved ability to perform daily functions. Exercise can also help to reduce depression and anxiety in people with arthritis and other conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW CAN I PREPARE TO EXERCISE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All people, especially those with arthritis, benefit from a balanced program of flexibility, strengthening, and endurance or aerobic exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Talk to your doctor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with arthritis can successfully exercise on their own. Before beginning an exercise program, contact your doctor or other health care provider to be sure it is safe. Specific questions to ask include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there specific exercises or movements that should be avoided? For example, after hip replacement, patients often have hip movement restrictions early in the recovery; patients with inflamed joints may be told to do range-of-motion exercises only.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there specific exercises that should be included to maintain optimal health? For example, people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) benefit from regular hand and wrist exercises to maintain range of motion and function. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific exercise suggestions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do I need to be evaluated by a physical or occupational therapist before starting to exercise? If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to the questions below, an evaluation may be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do stiffness, limited motion, or joint deformities make it difficult or painful to move?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have past exercise attempts been unsuccessful due to pain that does not go away with rest or a reduced exercise program?</p><p/><p>Pain, stiffness, and fatigue are barriers to exercise success for many people with arthritis. Preparing for exercise can minimize these issues. Some people benefit from a warm shower prior to exercise. Cardiovascular warm-ups and cool-downs are recommended for all exercisers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Warm up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of the warm-up is to improve circulation and to increase the temperature of muscles and joint structures so that the body is less stiff, movement is easier, and risk of injury is decreased. If you are successful, your body will feel slightly warmer than when you started. Stretching is best done after your exercise session as part of your cool down. Some people like to stretch after their warm-up.</p><p>People with arthritis may need a longer warm-up and cool-down. A three- to five-minute warm-up is recommended for the general population, while 10 to 15 minutes is optimal for people with arthritis. However, if you are walking slowly or exercising less than 10 minutes, you do not need a separate warm-up and cool-down.</p><p>Sample warm-up activities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walk or bike at half normal speed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sit and perform range of motion <span class=\"nowrap\">exercises/flexibility</span> exercises starting at the head and neck and progressing to the feet and ankles (ideally using the same muscles that will be involved in the exercise)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>March in place</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cool down</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of the cool-down is to return your heart rate to a few beats above normal. This prevents a sudden drop in blood pressure, feelings of nausea, fainting, and dizziness.</p><p>Sample cool-down activities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowing down your walking, biking, etc gradually</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifting light weights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretching exercises</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Stretching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stretching returns muscles to their full length and reduces soreness after exercise. People with arthritis need to be more cautious if they have lax joints (extra mobility or hyper-flexibility) or malaligned joints (eg, hand deformities, bowlegged). Flexibility exercises can include modified yoga and tai chi (a Chinese martial art that involves slow, gentle movements), as well as stretches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHRITIS EXERCISES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercises to improve muscle strength and build endurance are important components of an arthritis treatment program. Aquatic and land-based exercises are effective at improving strength, function, and physical fitness. Tai chi and yoga should be considered as possible components of an exercise program when performed carefully and should be supervised initially to make needed modifications and to prevent injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Strengthening exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strengthening exercises can help to improve joint stability and decrease pain. Examples of exercises that build strength include the use of free weights, weight machines, or body weight (eg, modified squats to build knee strength).</p><p>People with lax or malaligned knees should use caution with certain strengthening exercises because improving quadriceps strength (the muscles in the thighs) may speed the progression of preexisting arthritis. A physical therapist who specializes in treating arthritis-related knee problems can provide specific advice and can recommend exercises to balance strength building. Treatment may include modified exercises and appropriate bracing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Tips for success</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Movements should be smooth, not jerky.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care should be taken to avoid gripping the weight or exercise machine handle too tightly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The weight should be light enough that the movement can be performed 8 to 10 times (one set) without pain or excessive fatigue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid fatigue and joint stress, alternate one set of arm exercises with one set of leg exercises (eg, one set of biceps curls, one set of quadriceps curls, one set of triceps curls, one set of hamstrings curls, then repeat the circuit).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The weight can be increased when 10 repetitions can be performed with ease and when the increased weight does not increase joint pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with inflammatory arthritis should err on the side of caution, and they should start with a lighter weight and increase slowly. For example, arm exercises can start with as little as 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Endurance exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endurance exercises work to increase the heart and breathing rates, which can improve heart health, lower blood pressure, and improve fitness. Exercise does not need to be strenuous; during moderate-intensity endurance exercises, you should be able to carry on a conversation.</p><p>The type and amount of endurance exercise recommended depends upon a person's current fitness level. A person who has avoided exercise due to pain or lack of success might need to begin with just five minutes of slow walking. Low-impact exercises are preferable to minimize stress on the joints. Swimming and biking are low- or no-impact forms of endurance exercise that can be safely performed by most people with arthritis.</p><p>Aquatic exercises are of particular benefit for those with severe disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a low fitness level, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The buoyancy provided by water decreases pressure on joints and allows a person to exercise without the constraints imposed by body weight. Aquatic exercise programs often include group exercises in the water or walking in water. If you like to swim but have shoulder or neck issues that make it difficult to turn the head, you may need to consult with a therapist to design a successful swimming program. Some people can successfully reduce neck movement by using a snorkel and mask.</p><p>In general, exercise should start at a low intensity and for a short time. It is normal to feel some joint or muscle soreness after exercising, although soreness should not last more than two hours. If pain or fatigue lasts into the next day, the exercise was probably too long or too vigorous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Protect the joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with arthritis need to take a few extra precautions to protect their joints while exercising. The following tips are recommended.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walk on flat, level surfaces, especially if prone to hip, knee, foot, or ankle problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear supportive footwear, such as athletic shoes, and use a shoe insert that supports the arches and provides cushioning (eg, Spenco) to reduce impact on hips, knees, and feet. The shoe's original liner may be fine, although an insert with additional cushioning is often helpful for people with foot or knee pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid jarring movements and high-impact activities such as running.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect pain, do not ignore it, and monitor for pain during exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start slow and increase activity gradually.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pay attention to posture and alignment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not take excess pain medication prior to exercise; this can mask pain and cause you to over-exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caution is recommended after a knee or hip replacement. High-impact sports such as running, football, baseball, basketball, and soccer are not recommended. However, participation in low- or no-impact sports such as swimming, cycling, or walking is encouraged.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific exercise instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instructions for specific exercises for people with arthritis are available from the following resources:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/exercise-physical-activity-your-everyday-guide-national-institute-aging-1&amp;token=N2wZD0ipQ2GEs4yBdVG+AI/7NQmfkRrih1E0ZCJgvCPcDpDyqkuttuYjFz+YGTyKH49Dlj1GIxU3rTPpiKGOH3fauXub04u4NQuwD3AIpOHzO/KURbOW2Tp4WlrhSrs1rhgHscqDJ81pqPABqREWDg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=506\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Everyday guide to exercise and physical activity</a>, available on the website of the National Institute on Aging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Arthritis Helpbook by K.

For example, if the knees are affected, bend and extend the knees as far as comfortably possible several times per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have knee OA, knee-strengthening exercises can reduce pain and make it easier to walk, get up and down from a chair, and climb stairs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69481 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64474\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64474 \">picture 10</a>). Be sure to keep the joints in line by avoiding twisting motions or moving at an angle. You can do strengthening exercises even if your OA is severe; they can help you to function better with less pain and with an improved quality of life. Some people with knee OA find that doing Tai chi helps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise helps decrease pain and prevent disability in people with OA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerobic exercise also helps to prevent depression in people with OA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip-strengthening exercises are especially helpful for reducing pain and improving function in knee OA, although they are unlikely to slow the progression of the arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-impact activities (biking, swimming, tai chi) are recommended when knees, hips, and spine are affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee braces or other supports (eg, a Neoprene sleeve) may be helpful if there is pain while walking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher activity levels promote better function, and people with OA benefit from being as active as they are able.</p><p/><p>However, some knee braces are of little value for people who have active arthritis, significant joint instability, malaligned knees (bow-legged), or knees that &ldquo;give out&rdquo; as a result of arthritis. With a clinician's referral, an orthotist can provide an appropriate brace for these conditions and can provide instructions for wearing the brace correctly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia are fatigue; tender points around the shoulders, back, hips, and knees; and generalized aching and stiffness. Joints do not become swollen as a result of fibromyalgia alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise, especially endurance exercises and gentle strengthening, is key to managing this condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid very prolonged or vigorous exercise, as this may worsen symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When supervised by professionals, people with fibromyalgia benefit from moderate resistance training. Resistance exercises help to reduce the number of tender points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being physically fit seems to help lower pain levels, and helps people with fibromyalgia feel more confident that they can do things.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=506\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
