Although there have been many advances in conservative renal replacement therapy, renal transplantation is the best treatment for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This was shown in a study from Australia and New Zealand, in which the risk for death was more than four times higher with dialysis than with renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over the last several years, renal allograft and patient survival have increased due to improvements in the care of young patients and advances in immunosuppressive therapy, thereby resulting in reduced frequency and severity of acute rejection.

It has been reported to be as high as 14.8 cases per million children in the United States and as low as four cases per million children below the age of 19 in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In Europe, the incidence of renal replacement therapy varies greatly among countries, with a reported average incidence based on population-based studies of 5.5 cases per million children aged 0 to 14 years and 8.3 cases in children aged 0 to 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The higher incidence in the United States may be explained by an earlier start on renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The renal diseases responsible for CKD in children are different from those observed in adult patients. For example, diabetic nephropathy and hypertension are rare causes of CKD in children but common in adults, whereas congenital renal and urologic anomalies are the most common cause of CKD in children.</p><p>The incidence and etiology of CKD are discussed in greater detail separately.

An analysis of data 12 months after implementation showed transplants for pediatric patients (aged 0 to 17) declined slightly from 4.2 to 3.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the pediatric candidates continue to receive priority that provides them greater access to more timely transplants and kidneys that are expected to function longer than adult candidates. There has been no significant difference in pediatric patient or allograft survival under the new system. </p><p>Other countries have also implemented policy changes to prioritize allocation of allografts from deceased donors to pediatric recipients. As an example, such a policy has been in place in France since 1995.</p><p>In the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborate Studies (NAPRTCS) registry, more male children (approximately 60 percent) receive kidney transplants than female, primarily due to the higher numbers of males with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) that progress to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

For example, CAKUT is the primary cause of ESRD in 40 percent of children less than six years of age, whereas it is the etiology in only 20 percent of those between 11 and 17 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17417151\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES OF RENAL TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient survival is superior among children with a kidney allograft compared with those who remain on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].

As a result, renal transplantation is the preferred renal replacement therapy for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The quality of life is much better after renal transplantation.

Preemptive transplants occur more frequently in children than adults because of the parents&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; desire to avoid dialysis when a living donor is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When performed, this procedure most commonly involves a living donor who is related to the recipient. Children can also be listed for a preemptive deceased donor transplant.</p><p>In the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborate Studies (NAPRTCS) registry, the rate of preemptive transplant in children is approximately 25 percent. The rate of preemptive transplantation differs significantly between recipients of living (34 percent) and deceased donor (14 percent) allografts; and across races with whites having the highest rates (31 percent), followed by Hispanics (17 percent) and blacks (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Data from the NAPRTCS registry and a study from a single tertiary center have shown improved allograft <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient survival with preemptive transplantation in patients with primary renal transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In a retrospective study of nearly 40,000 primary renal transplants in both children and adults from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), preemptive transplantation compared with transplantation while undergoing dialysis was associated with a reduced risk of both allograft failure and death for deceased donor transplants (relative risk [RR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.84, and RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.99), and for living donor transplants (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.83, and RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this study, preemptive transplantation was associated with racial minorities, patients with less education, and those who relied on Medicare for primary payment.</p><p>Other studies have found that allograft and patient survival, and the incidence of rejection were similar in patients transplanted preemptively versus those transplanted while already undergoing dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The largest of these studies was a multicenter European study that included 1113 first renal transplants in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Preemptive transplantation was associated with a lower rate of rejections in the first three years following transplantation (48 versus 63 percent). There was no statistical difference in allograft survival at six-year follow-up, although there was a trend that favored preemptive transplantation (82 versus 69 percent).</p><p>There are some circumstances in which preemptive transplants cannot be performed or are not recommended.

In addition, it is associated with better growth and developmental outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H17417151\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of renal transplantation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes of renal transplantation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of ESRD in children who undergo transplantation is congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract (40 percent), followed by glomerular disorders (25 percent) and <span class=\"nowrap\">hereditary/genetic</span> renal diseases (15 percent), particularly focal glomerulosclerosis in black patients. (See <a href=\"#H5913726\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although it remains uncertain whether preemptive renal transplantation is associated with better long-term outcome compared with transplantation while undergoing dialysis, children frequently undergo <strong>preemptive</strong> transplantation, in which transplantation is the first mode of treatment for ESRD. This procedure most commonly involves a living donor who is related to the recipient. It occurs more frequently in children than adults because of the parents&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; desire to avoid dialysis when a living donor is available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our approach is to offer preemptive renal transplantation to suitable transplant candidates if there is a readily available living donor. If there is not an available living donor, we place the patient on the active deceased donor waitlist in the chance that they may receive a transplant before needing dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H17417513\" class=\"local\">'Preemptive transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few contraindications for renal transplantation as the modality of choice for renal replacement therapy in children with ESRD. They include sepsis, uncontrolled extra-renal malignancies, irreversible multiorgan failure, severe cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction not corrected by organ transplant, underlying life-threatening disorder not corrected by renal transplant, elevated levels of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, and a recent history of nonadherence to medical care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft survival is superior with a living donor versus a deceased donor allograft. (See <a href=\"#H5913747\" class=\"local\">'Donor choice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretransplant evaluation and preparation are key components for a successful transplant in the pediatric recipient.
