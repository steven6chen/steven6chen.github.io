It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are monoclonal in origin.</p><p>CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease at different stages) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), one of the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the bone marrow and blood, while the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal. While there are some differences in the treatment of early stage CLL and SLL, the treatment of advanced stage disease is the same. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of CLL is extremely variable. While many cases follow an indolent course that is well controlled with standard therapy, others progress rapidly and die within two to three years after diagnosis from complications or causes directly related to CLL. The initial treatment of symptomatic CLL primarily consists of an immunotherapy-based chemotherapy regimen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus chemotherapy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in CLL is an emerging therapy for selected patients and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials. Autologous HCT is not curative, but may result in prolonged remissions and has a low treatment-related mortality rate. In comparison, allogeneic HCT may cure a percentage of patients with CLL, but is associated with higher treatment-related mortality. The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)&quot; will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of HCT in CLL is reviewed below. Other treatment options are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351650637\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CLL are generally elderly and, due to the relatively benign course of the disease in the majority of patients, only a selected subset is considered for aggressive treatments such as HCT. The determination of transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions and depends upon the type of transplantation (ie, allogeneic versus autologous) and the conditioning regimen (eg, myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative).</p><p>In most centers in the United States, patients are considered eligible for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT if they are less than 75 years of age, with normal cardiac, liver, and renal function, and have a good performance status (ECOG performance status 0 or 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>). For myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, eligibility is more restrictive in that patients should typically be less than 55 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, age is not considered to be a strict inclusion or exclusion criterion for autologous HCT. In most centers in the United States, patients with one or more of the following factors are <strong>not</strong> considered eligible for autologous HCT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct bilirubin &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (34.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/liter)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/liter)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3 or 4 unless due to bone pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New York Heart Association functional status Class III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351650834\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF TRANSPLANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal timing of HCT in CLL depends upon a number of factors, and transplants should be carried out in the context of a clinical trial whenever possible. Such trials may be appropriate for young patients with clinically aggressive relapsed or refractory CLL. HCT may also be considered for patients with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma#H1318920966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>The following sections describe the use of HCT for the treatment of previously untreated CLL, relapsed or refractory CLL, and transformed disease. Interpretation of the trials that have investigated the relative value of HCT versus combination chemotherapy alone for patients with CLL is complicated by subsequent changes in the standard care of CLL. Since these trials were performed, the routine incorporation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> into the standard treatment of CLL has improved survival rates among patients who do not undergo HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5622415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1138003\"><span class=\"h2\">Previously untreated disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic CLL are treated with immunotherapy (ie, monoclonal antibody directed against CD20) plus combination chemotherapy. This approach is well tolerated and produces prolonged responses in the majority of patients. Allogeneic HCT is not recommended in this setting due to its higher morbidity and mortality rates. In contrast, several retrospective analyses and a single multicenter prospective randomized trial have examined the use of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT in the treatment of newly diagnosed CLL. While some studies have demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival, none has shown an overall survival benefit. As such, immunotherapy plus chemotherapy remains the standard therapy for most patients with previously untreated CLL. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autologous HCT'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5622415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351650955\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapsed or refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients treated for CLL will have an initial response to therapy, but virtually all of these patients will ultimately develop progressive disease requiring subsequent treatment. While relapsed disease is typically sensitive to additional therapy, the duration of remission becomes shorter with each subsequent regimen. While progression is not always accompanied by a change in histology, a subset of patients will transform to a more aggressive histology. The use of either autologous or allogeneic HCT in relapsed CLL is an emerging option for some patients and the subject of numerous ongoing clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic HCT'</a> below.)</p><p>Autologous HCT, myeloablative HCT, and nonmyeloablative HCT have not been directly compared for the treatment of relapsed CLL in a randomized fashion. As such, judgement of these treatment modalities must keep in mind selection biases that inevitably hinder comparisons of retrospective analyses and uncontrolled prospective case series. The use of each of these modalities is described in more detail in the following sections.</p><p>The decision to perform a HCT in an eligible patient with relapsed CLL depends upon the aggressiveness of disease and prior therapies. While limited, our best measure of disease aggressiveness is the length and quality of initial (and subsequent) remission(s). Patients with an initial remission duration significantly less than the median progression-free survival (PFS) for an individual treatment regimen are more likely to have a short subsequent remission duration. </p><p>While younger, fit patients may be considered for allogeneic HCT at the time to relapse, observational studies suggest that patients in complete response at the time of HCT will have a better prognosis. As such, even patients who plan to undergo HCT should be initially treated at the time of relapse to achieve a remission prior to transplant. Young patients with a good performance status and few comorbidities may be considered for HCT performed as part of a clinical trial. Details regarding the choice of therapy in these patient populations are presented separately.

Histologic transformation from an indolent to an aggressive histology has been associated with a poor prognosis. The use of allogeneic HCT for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive transformed CLL is supported by small retrospective analyses. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma#H1318920966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351651079\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE OF TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no clear consensus among experts as to whether HCT should be performed in patients with CLL and regarding the ideal type of HCT for patients with CLL. Patients with early relapse or refractory CLL who respond to second-line chemotherapy may be candidates for HCT, administered within the context of a clinical trial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myeloablative allogeneic HCT has a treatment-related mortality rate that approaches 50 percent, but may be curative in a highly select cohort of patients. Side effects include graft-versus-host disease, secondary malignancies, chronic immunosuppression, and cardiac and pulmonary toxicity. These types of transplants are rarely performed currently due to less toxic alternatives. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Myeloablative preparative regimens'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT appear to have a lower treatment-related mortality (approximately 5 to 25 percent), with a significant proportion of patients achieving durable responses. Side effects are much less than those of myeloablative regimens, and these approaches are better tolerated in older individuals.

Patients who undergo autologous HCT appear to have an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, perhaps as a result of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy administered before or during preparative regimen. As a result, autologous HCT is also relatively rarely performed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autologous HCT'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Myeloablative HCT has not been directly compared with nonmyeloablative or autologous HCT or with combination chemotherapy in a prospective manner, and it is unlikely that such trials will be attempted due to the advanced age of the majority of patients with CLL.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study compared results in 14 patients with CLL and unmutated Vh genes treated with myeloablative allogeneic HCT with results in 20 patients with CLL and unmutated Vh genes who had undergone myeloablative autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The five-year risk of disease relapse was significantly less for those undergoing allogeneic HCT than autologous HCT (17 versus 66 percent, respectively). There was no difference in overall survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of 162 patients with high-risk CLL who underwent myeloablative allogeneic (25 patients) or autologous (137 patients) HCT at a single institution reported no difference in overall survival between these two groups at a median follow-up of 6.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional nonrandomized studies of each of these treatment modalities are presented in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Allogeneic HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic HCT is the only treatment option for patients with CLL with the potential for cure.

Nonmyeloablative approaches have been better tolerated in this patient population that tends to be older and often has other co-morbid medical conditions. A major difficulty with both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT is the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Intensive research is underway in an attempt to dissociate GVL from GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of relapse following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of uncontrolled studies have evaluated the efficacy of both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in CLL. They are all limited by small size, absence of long-term follow-up, and treatment-related mortality. Evaluation of the results is also limited by issues related to patient selection, since variable criteria have been used to determine appropriate candidates for HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Myeloablative HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) takes advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia effect to eradicate remaining disease and may cure a subset of patients with untransformed CLL. Several nonrandomized prospective trials and retrospective analyses have demonstrated the potential efficacy of myeloablative allogeneic HCT in CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2,6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-14</a>]. This approach has been associated with treatment-related mortality rates as high as 50 percent, which is unacceptably high.</p><p>Given the high rate of treatment-related morbidity and mortality, myeloablative HCT cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial for the treatment of CLL. Nonmyeloablative HCT or occasionally autologous HCT may be considered, as part of a clinical trial, for high risk patients who have failed fludarabine-based chemotherapy.

Aggressive treatment of the patient prior to the planned HCT is generally considered an important component of therapy. Reduced intensity and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT are considered investigational and should be considered as part of a clinical trial for such patients. Patient-related features such as short duration of first remission, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, and certain genetic risk factors including 11q22 and 17p13 abnormalities predict for poor outcome with standard therapies and should be considered for reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autologous HCT may prolong progression-free survival, but not overall survival, in a subset of patients who are in complete remission or have minimal disease at the time of HCT.

However, this approach uses more intensive chemotherapy regimens and the impact on quality of life is not known. The best data regarding the use of autologous HCT come from two randomized trials performed prior to the incorporation of immunotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) into the initial treatment of CLL. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT can produce a CR, but is not curative. The lack of a survival benefit seen with autologous HCT suggests that patients relapsing after standard chemotherapy could be successfully treated with second or third line therapies.

Patients who relapse after autologous HCT may be candidates for allogeneic HCT. For patients who relapse after allogeneic HCT, treatments include reduction of immunosuppression and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in addition to other therapies used for relapsed or refractory CLL. Reduction of immunosuppression and DLI should be incorporated into the initial management of all patients with relapse unless concerns regarding graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or myelosuppression make this approach unfeasible.</p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy of these treatment options.

The determination of transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H351650637\" class=\"local\">'Determining transplant eligibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal timing of HCT in CLL is unknown and transplants should be carried out in the context of a clinical trial whenever possible. Such trials may be appropriate for young patients with clinically aggressive relapsed or refractory CLL or those with high risk genetic factors including 11q22 and 17p13 abnormalities. HCT may also be considered for patients with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See <a href=\"#H351650834\" class=\"local\">'Timing of transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear consensus among experts regarding the ideal type of HCT for patients with CLL, although with the development and wider use of non-myeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT, this approach has emerged as the preferred choice by most centers. Transplantation based treatments have not been directly compared with combination chemotherapy in a prospective manner. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nonmyeloablative HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic CLL, we recommend treatment with combination chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) rather than autologous HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) or allogeneic HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). An exception could be patients with p53 mutations who have very high risk disease and could be considered for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT at first complete or partial remission. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autologous HCT'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5622415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with disease that has relapsed more than one year after an initial response, we suggest retreatment with the same therapy that provided that initial response or use of a second-line chemotherapy regimen rather than upfront HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Following response, non-myeloablative allogeneic HCT is a reasonable option depending upon other factors such as age, comorbid medical conditions, risk factors and patient preference.
