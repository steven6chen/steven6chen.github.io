The association between red to brown urine (quickly recognized as hemoglobinuria) being passed following exposure to cold was established by 1872. The recognition that this syndrome was often seen in patients with syphilis soon followed and the demonstration of an antibody as the cause came in 1904, from the studies of Donath and Landsteiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the major features of PCH. The more common cold agglutinin syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Cold agglutinin disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-agglutinin-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold agglutinin disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antibody in PCH is a cold-reacting IgG. It is always polyclonal. Unlike cold-reacting IgM, it does not cause red cell agglutination but, similar to cold-reacting IgM, it is able to fix complement readily. The maximum temperature at which these antibodies are able to interact (ie, their thermal amplitude) varies greatly from patient to patient, as is also the case with the IgM cold agglutinins.</p><p>The mechanism of hemolysis in PCH is similar to that in cold agglutinin disease (CAD). As the blood circulates to the periphery, it cools, and the antibody and the first two components of complement are fixed to the RBC surface. The complement cascade is completed only when the RBC are subsequently warmed to 37&deg;C. For reasons that are not clearly understood, perhaps because the antigen is located on the RBC membrane surface, these antibodies are quite efficient in bringing about direct lysis by complement; this results in intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and hemosiderinuria. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibody specificity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult#H2897147055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;, section on 'Intravascular hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antigen with which the antibody in PCH interacts is the P antigen, a polysaccharide that is usually affixed to a ceramide moiety on the surface of the red cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This antibody will cause hemolysis in almost all subjects, since only rare individuals have red cells lacking the P antigen (the pp or Tj(a) - phenotype). Of interest, the P antigen structure is also a binding site for parvovirus, one strain of which (B19) causes transient pure red aplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H1033389332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'Lewis, P1P(K), GLOB, and I blood group systems'</a>.)</p><p>Occasional antibodies in patients with PCH have anti-i or anti-Pr specificity such as that seen in CAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated illnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, PCH was primarily a disease of patients with secondary or tertiary syphilis. This relationship may have been due to a syphilis antigen that generated a cross-reacting antibody causative of the syndrome. Post-infectious or autoimmune settings are now the most common causes of PCH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17640177\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-infectious</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, PCH most often follows a viral infection, often varicella. Other viral infections that have been implicated include measles, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>PCH may also follow other infections, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, and visceral leishmaniasis in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It has also been seen following vaccination for measles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17640184\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoimmune</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, and occasionally in children, PCH is an autoimmune disorder. It may occur in the context of other immune abnormalities and rarely in lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]. The adult form of PCH is usually chronic, lasting several years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical scenario for PCH is quite similar to that seen in both warm-antibody hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children in that the antibody appears approximately 7 to 10 days after the onset of the febrile illness and persists for 6 to 12 weeks afterward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The peak antibody titer is reached rapidly and may cause severe hemolytic anemia and even death if not properly controlled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F103370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The typical manifestation of PCH is the passage of darkly colored urine (hemoglobinuria), beginning a few minutes to several hours after exposure to cold, a manifestation of intravascular hemolysis. The reason for this delay in some patients is not known. The onset of hemolysis is otherwise rapid but does not persist if cold exposure is ended. Constitutional symptoms, such as back or leg pains, abdominal cramping, chills, and fever may be present. Other symptoms that can occur include the Raynaud phenomenon, caused by arteriolar constriction, and urticaria.</p><p>Acute renal failure, a rare presentation, has been described in two children with PCH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H395799\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with PCH exhibit hemoglobinuria, but the vast majority have evidence of intravascular hemolysis, often with clinical jaundice, reticulocytosis, hemosiderinuria, increased concentrations of indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, reduced concentration of haptoglobin, and depressed levels of serum complement. Spherocytes and erythrophagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes, sometimes striking, may occasionally be found on examination of the peripheral smear during the acute attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult#H2897147055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;, section on 'Intravascular hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p>The degree of anemia is variable and depends upon the titer of the antibody, its thermal amplitude (ie, the highest temperature at which the antibody can react with the antigen), the exposure to cold ambient temperatures, and patient age. In acute PCH of childhood, the anemia may be severe and has been reported as a common cause of death in this age group. Most adults have a moderate degree of anemia that is seasonally worsened by the onset of cold weather.</p><p>The direct Coombs test is positive using anti-C3 and negative for IgG during a hemolytic episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69817 \">table 2</a>) but may be negative between crises. Neutropenia can occur during severe hemolytic crises, although its cause is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCH is an acquired hemolytic anemia caused by a cold-reacting IgG antibody that fixes complement to the red cells in the cold and causes intravascular hemolysis on rewarming. The diagnosis of PCH requires all of the following to be present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of intravascular hemolysis, typically occurring on rewarming after a cold exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro demonstration of an IgG antibody that reacts with the red cell at reduced temperature but not at 37&deg;C and causes hemolysis on rewarming (see <a href=\"#H24127183\" class=\"local\">'Testing for the Donath-Landsteiner antibody'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Coombs test that is positive for complement but negative for IgG during a hemolytic episode</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24127183\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing for the Donath-Landsteiner antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donath and Landsteiner used a hemolytic assay in which the patient's serum was incubated with normal red cells and pooled normal human serum as a source of complement at 4&deg;C for a period of time (during which antibody and the early components of complement were fixed) and then incubated at 37&deg;C in order to allow the later components of complement to be activated. Hemolysis occurred if antibody was present but did not occur if the reaction mixture was continuously maintained at 37&deg;C.</p><p>This diagnostic test is not very sensitive, as normal red cells are hemolyzed only with difficulty by human complement; thus, many patients with PCH of mild to moderate severity remain undiagnosed. A variation of the test includes papain during the incubation at 37&deg;C to increase access to the P antigens. To demonstrate the P-specificity of the Donath-Landsteiner antibody, ABO-compatible, P-negative cells can be used as an additional negative control. A few more sensitive tests exist, although they are not generally available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity of this test can be increased by the use of red cells from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which are much more susceptible to lysis by complement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If red cells from a patient with PNH are not available, &quot;artificial&quot; PNH cells can be made from normal red cells by treatment with aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET) or other mercaptide-bearing compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests using radiolabeled monoclonal anti-IgG are the most sensitive. In these tests, the patient's serum and normal red cells are incubated at 4&deg;C, washed with cold buffer, and incubated again at 4&deg;C with the anti-IgG reagent. The cells are then centrifuged through cold medium that separates them from the unreacted reagent and the amount of radioactivity remaining on the cells is calculated; this will be elevated if the antibody is present. The control experiment is conducted at 37&deg;C throughout. Although the endpoint of this test is not in vitro hemolysis, it is able to detect PCH antibodies that are not found even with the more sensitive hemolytic assays.</p><p/><p>A survey of Canadian reference laboratories demonstrated large variability in interpretation of Donath-Landsteiner antibody testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The study recommended that this test be performed only in the presence of hemoglobinemia (with or without hemoglobinuria), a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT; positive for C3), a negative antibody screen (with the only exception being positivity due to alloimmunization from prior transfusion), and no evidence of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA), cold agglutinin disease (CAD), drug-induced hemolytic anemia (DIHA), PNH, or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR).</p><p>In unpublished data (from the laboratory of Dr. Wendell Rosse at Duke University), the serum of 14 patients with PCH was examined; four were positive in the Donath-Landsteiner test using normal cells, Twelve were positive using PNH cells, and all 14 were positive using the radiolabeled antibody; AET-treated cells were not tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24127175\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p>The differential diagnosis for a patient who has developed hemolytic anemia following exposure to cold is limited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F103370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103370 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cold agglutinin disease (CAD)</strong> &ndash; In CAD there is a high titer of cold agglutinins of the IgM type. The typical patient with CAD has a titer in excess of 1 in 10,000 and the test for Donath-Landsteiner antibodies is negative. In PCH, the cold agglutinin titer is, at most, only moderately elevated (ie, &lt;1:160).
