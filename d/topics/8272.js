It can travel in dust specks that you can breathe in. Most people who get histoplasmosis get better without treatment.</p><p>The fungus that causes histoplasmosis is found in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midwestern and central states in the United States, along the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some states along the east coast of the United States</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mexico and Central and South America</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parts of eastern and southern Europe, Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia</p><p/><p>Most people living in areas where the histoplasmosis fungus is found never get sick. But infections can happen in people who have trouble fighting infection and in people who are exposed to a large amount of the fungus, such as farm or construction workers or people who visit caves (called &quot;spelunkers&quot;). Histoplasmosis tends to affect the lungs. In rare cases, the infection can spread throughout the body, especially in people whose immune system is not working well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629377828\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of histoplasmosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often histoplasmosis causes no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can happen weeks to months after you are exposed to the fungus. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain when taking a deep breath </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aching joints (sometimes with a skin rash)</p><p>If you have these symptoms, your doctor might do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. The X-ray can give your doctor an idea of whether you are likely to have histoplasmosis or something else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629377843\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for histoplasmosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have histoplasmosis, he or she might do tests to look for signs of the infection. These can include blood or urine tests and tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up. There is also a test that involves putting a tube into your lungs to get a sample of fluid or tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629377858\"><span class=\"h1\">How is histoplasmosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histoplasmosis does not always need to be treated. If you are fairly healthy, your doctor or nurse might want to wait and see if you can fight off the infection on your own. He or she will want to see you a few times to make sure you are getting better.</p><p>For people who do need to be treated, there are medicines called &ldquo;anti-fungals&rdquo; that can kill the fungus that causes histoplasmosis. Some people must take them for months or even years. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with HIV infection (or AIDS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had an organ transplant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with cancers of the blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who take medicines called &ldquo;steroids&rdquo; or other medicines that partly &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; the immune system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629377873\"><span class=\"h1\">Can histoplasmosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you live in an area where histoplasmosis occurs, you can reduce your chances of getting the infection by doing the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not disturb the soil in areas where birds roost</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not visit areas where buildings have been demolished</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not explore caves</p><p/></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
