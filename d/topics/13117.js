Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Europe, where it accounts for 90 percent of all bladder cancers. In other areas of the world, non-urothelial carcinomas are more frequent. Much less commonly, urothelial cancers can arise from other sites in the urinary tract, including the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The pathology of bladder neoplasms will be reviewed here. Clinical aspects of these different tumor types are discussed separately.

The system proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1972 distinguished papillomas from grade I, II, and III papillary transitional cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In 1998, WHO and the International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) published a consensus classification system for urothelial (transitional cell) neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinical significance of this schema was validated by subsequent studies, and in 2004, it was accepted as the standard classification schema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 2016 WHO system used the same classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>According to this system, urothelial carcinoma is classified as low grade and high grade based upon the degree of nuclear anaplasia and architectural abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51333 \">figure 1</a>). With rare exceptions (eg, nested or tubular variants), invasive urothelial carcinoma is high grade in its cytological features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wall of the bladder consists of four layers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55649 \">picture 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urothelium &ndash; The urothelium is the innermost epithelial lining of the bladder.

Wispy fascicles of smooth muscle can be found within the mid lamina propria, either isolated or forming a complete or incomplete muscularis mucosae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscularis propria &ndash; The muscularis propria (detrusor muscle) surrounds the lamina propria and consists of thick, irregularly arranged muscle bundles. In small biopsies, fascicles of muscle mucosae in the lamina propria may be confused with the larger smooth muscle bundles of the muscularis propria, potentially resulting in an error in tumor staging. Adipose tissue also can be present within the lamina propria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscularis propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The depth of invasion is incorporated into the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification schema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>). The staging of the primary bladder tumor (pT) in the eighth edition AJCC has not changed from the seventh edition. This information has major implications for both prognosis and treatment.</p><p>Most pT1 tumors are high-grade papillary urothelial carcinomas, although low-grade tumors have rarely been diagnosed. More deeply invasive pT2 to pT4 urothelial carcinomas are high grade. Several studies showed that pT1 tumors have a less favorable prognosis than pTa neoplasms. However, pTa and pT1 neoplasms are grouped together as &quot;non-muscle invasive&quot; tumors because both pTa and pT1 lesions are managed conservatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Lamina propria invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recognition of lamina propria invasion by urothelial carcinoma can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Biopsy specimens are often poorly oriented, fragmented, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cauterized. In pT1 disease, foci of invasion are characterized by urothelial nests, clusters, or single cells within the papillary cores <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lamina propria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73869\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73869 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p>The invasive nests can induce a desmoplastic stromal response that mimics a malignant spindle cell component, a feature known as pseudosarcomatous stromal reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73869\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73869 \">picture 2</a>). In addition, foci of invasive tumor may be associated with retraction artifact, mimicking vascular invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73869\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73869 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Although the WHO classification does not substage pT1 tumors according to the depth of lamina propria invasion, some studies have demonstrated prognostic differences in tumors with invasion above and below the muscularis mucosae. The maximum size of the invasive focus seems to confer additional prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Therefore, pathologists should provide the extent of lamina propria invasion if such assessment is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscularis propria invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In more advanced stages, urothelial carcinoma infiltrates the muscularis propria (pT2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74142 \">picture 3</a>), or perivesical adipose tissue and adjacent organs (pT3 and pT4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76177\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76177 \">picture 4</a>). Muscularis propria invasion is diagnosed when urothelial carcinoma infiltrates between thick, distinct fascicles of muscle bundles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74142 \">picture 3</a>). Muscle invasion by urothelial carcinoma may or may not elicit a desmoplastic stromal response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Uncertainty about the depth of invasion should be explicitly stated in the pathology report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Even in cases of noninvasive disease, the pathologist should note whether muscularis propria was present in the biopsy specimen to provide information regarding the adequacy of resection.</p><p>Adipose tissue is often present between detrusor muscle bundles. Thus, the mere presence of tumor in fat in a biopsy does not necessarily equate with involvement of perivesical fat.</p><p>Bladder cancer may invade the prostate gland. Involvement of the prostate gland may occur in several different patterns. Tumors (flat carcinoma in situ, papillary or invasive carcinoma) can first spread along the prostatic urethral mucosa and prostate glands, and subsequently invade prostatic stroma (transurethral mucosal route). Tumors may also invade through the bladder wall and the base of the prostate directly into the prostate gland. Tumors can also invade into extravesical fat and then extend back into the prostate gland. The last two routes are considered direct transmural invasion. </p><p>The AJCC eighth edition staging manual defines direct transmural extension of urinary bladder cancer into the prostate gland as T4 disease and excludes transurethral, mucosal, prostatic stroma invasion from the pT4a staging status. However, there are limited data on the best methodology to stage urothelial carcinoma that concurrently involves the urinary bladder and the prostatic urethra. In patients who have a large urinary bladder carcinoma that has invaded through the full thickness of the bladder wall and, thereby, secondarily involves the prostatic stroma, a T4 stage should be assigned to urinary bladder staging. In other circumstances in which involvement by urothelial carcinoma is seen in both sites, separate urinary bladder and prostatic urethral staging should be assigned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular invasion is associated with adverse pathological features and upstaging at radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and is therefore important to recognize. Establishing the presence of vascular invasion is difficult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55403 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Urothelial carcinomas are commonly associated with a stromal retraction artifact that mimics vascular invasion. Caution is warranted, and rigid criteria should be applied. Immunostains for endothelial markers may be used in difficult and ambiguous cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINVASIVE UROTHELIAL NEOPLASMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal urothelial mucosa is flat and consists of a layer of three to seven cells, although the thickness depends upon the extent of bladder distension at the time of biopsy. Normal urothelial cells are approximately two to three times the size of stromal lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80375\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80375 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Noninvasive urothelial lesions are divided into flat and papillary subgroups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Flat lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flat noninvasive lesions of the urothelium include dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysplasia/atypia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplasia (low-grade intraurothelial neoplasia) is diagnosed when atypical dysplastic changes in urothelial cells do not meet the criteria for CIS. Some urologic pathologists combine &quot;dysplasia&quot; with the category of &quot;urothelial atypia cannot exclude dysplasia&quot; due to their similar clinical management strategy and the known reproducibility problems in diagnosing definitive flat neoplasia that fall short of the threshold for CIS. Areas of dysplasia are commonly associated with higher-grade bladder neoplasia, and the incidence of dysplasia approaches 100 percent in patients with invasive urothelial carcinoma. Primary (de novo) dysplasia without CIS or invasive urothelial carcinoma is seen predominantly in middle-aged men, who present with symptoms of bladder irritation with or without hematuria.</p><p>Dysplastic lesions show a variable loss of cell polarity with nuclear crowding and cytologic atypia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60337%7EONC%2F69993%7EONC%2F81871\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60337 graphicRef69993 graphicRef81871 \">picture 7A-C</a>). The cells may have slightly enlarged nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and rare mitoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60337\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60337 \">picture 7A</a>). The degree of atypia is comparable to that seen within noninvasive, low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (LGPUC). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'LGPUC'</a> below.)</p><p>The thickness of the urothelium in dysplastic lesions is usually normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60337%7EONC%2F69993%7EONC%2F81871\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60337 graphicRef69993 graphicRef81871 \">picture 7A-C</a>), although it may be increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69993\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69993 \">picture 7B</a>) or decreased. Urothelial dysplasia may involve von Brunn nests. Comparison with normal-appearing urothelium may help assess nucleomegaly and loss of polarity. The presence of pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, and increased numbers of mitoses suggests a diagnosis of CIS.</p><p>The finding of dysplasia in patients with noninvasive papillary neoplasms indicates urothelial instability and is a marker for potential progression or recurrence. De novo dysplasia progresses to CIS or invasive carcinoma in between 5 and 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Papillary lesions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Carcinoma in situ</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIS is a flat lesion in which the surface epithelium contains cells that are cytologically malignant. CIS is synonymous with high-grade intraurothelial neoplasia.</p><p>De novo (primary) CIS accounts for less than 1 to 3 percent of urothelial neoplasms. Areas of CIS are also identified in 45 to 65 percent of patients with invasive urothelial carcinomas. Patients with primary CIS are typically in their 40s or 50s, and may be asymptomatic or have dysuria, frequency, urgency, or hematuria. Multifocal involvement of the urinary tract with CIS is common and may be synchronous or metachronous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65140\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65140 \">picture 8</a>). Endoscopically, CIS is characterized by irregularly hyperemic mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76927\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76927 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p>Severe cytologic atypia is required to diagnose CIS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58125%7EONC%2F69860%7EONC%2F75477%7EONC%2F55750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58125 graphicRef69860 graphicRef75477 graphicRef55750 \">picture 10A-D</a>). The degree of nuclear anaplasia is identical to high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (HGPUC), although a spectrum of severity may exist. There may be complete loss of polarity, marked crowding, and pleomorphism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69860%7EONC%2F75477%7EONC%2F55750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69860 graphicRef75477 graphicRef55750 \">picture 10B-D</a>). The nuclei are enlarged, frequently hyperchromatic, and have coarse or condensed chromatin. Most nuclei in CIS are at least four to five times the size of adjacent stromal lymphocytes. Large nucleoli may be present. Mitoses are common, may be atypical, and can extend into the upper cell layers.</p><p>The neoplastic changes may or may not involve the entire thickness of the epithelial layer, and umbrella cells may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The urothelium may be denuded, diminished in thickness, of normal thickness, or even hyperplastic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58125%7EONC%2F69860\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58125 graphicRef69860 \">picture 10A-B</a>).</p><p>Different cytologic and architectural patterns are recognized in CIS. These include lesions characterized by pleomorphic large cells, nonpleomorphic large cells, small cells, clinging, and pagetoid features. Cystitis cystica and von Brunn nests may be completely or partially replaced by cytologically malignant cells, often after intravesical treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75477%7EONC%2F55750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75477 graphicRef55750 \">picture 10C-D</a>). Loss of intracellular cohesion may result in a denuded surface (denuding cystitis), and shedding of malignant cells into urine and positive urine cytology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67528%7EONC%2F82071\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67528 graphicRef82071 \">picture 11A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Data suggest that de novo CIS is less likely to progress to invasive urothelial carcinoma than secondary CIS. Patients with CIS and concomitant invasive tumors have a higher mortality than patients with CIS and concomitant noninvasive tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Papillary lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive papillary lesions of the bladder can be benign (urothelial papilloma, inverted papilloma), have malignant potential (papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential [PUNLMP]), or contain noninvasive LGPUC or HGPUC. PUNLMP, LGPUC, and HGPUC typically present with hematuria and are more common in men, with a mean age at diagnosis in the 60s.</p><p>Grade heterogeneity is not uncommonly encountered in papillary urothelial neoplasms. The 1998 World Health Organization (WHO) and International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) system assigns the grade of heterogeneous tumors based on the highest grade present in a tumor (of note, this system was republished in 2004 without major changes and was adopted in 2016 by WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite this, there is no widely accepted definition or criteria to provide a quantitative estimate of size of the smallest focus required to &quot;upgrade&quot; a lesion. Arbitrary criteria used include the presence of high-grade histology in at least 5 percent being sufficient to upstage an otherwise low-grade lesion. However, the prognostic impact of lesions that do not meet these criteria is unknown. In addition, low-quality data suggest that pure high-grade papillary carcinoma has a different biologic behavior, including a higher risk of disease progression, than mixed high-grade and low-grade tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additional studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the prognostic impact of heterogenous lesions and to inform a consensus definition of the allowable extent or percentage cutoff when a high-grade focus is identified within a heterogeneous papillary urothelial neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Urothelial papilloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urothelial papillomas are benign exophytic lesions characterized by simple nonbranching papillary fronds lined by normal-appearing urothelium lacking atypia. Urothelial papillomas account for 1 to 4 percent of bladder tumors; the male to female ratio is 1.9:1. Papillomas tend to occur in young patients and can be seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The typical presenting symptom is hematuria.</p><p>Most urothelial papillomas are located on the posterior or lateral walls of the bladder, close to the ureteral orifices or in the urethra. The lesions are usually relatively small and single, although multifocal tumors can be present. The cystoscopic appearance is identical to other low-grade papillary urothelial neoplasms.</p><p>Most papillomas have slender fibrovascular stalks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58742\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58742 \">picture 12</a>). Superficial umbrella cells are often prominent. Eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent vacuolization are common findings.

Hematuria or irritative symptoms are typical, although occasionally, these tumors produce symptoms of obstruction. Most inverted papillomas are solitary and can vary in size up to 8 cm. Approximately 70 percent occur in the bladder, typically in the trigone. Inverted papillomas can also occur in the ureter, renal pelvis, and urethra. Cystoscopically, these are sessile, pedunculated, or rarely, polypoid lesions with a smooth surface.</p><p>Inverted papillomas are characterized by anastomosing islands and cords of normal urothelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58322\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58322 \">picture 13</a>). The base of the lesion is well circumscribed. Urothelial cells may invaginate extensively into the lamina propria but not into the muscular bladder wall. In contrast to other papillary urothelial neoplasms, the peripheral portion of the cords demonstrates palisading basal cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58322\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58322 \">picture 13</a>). The stromal component is minimal and lacks inflammation. Foci of nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia are often present.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small cell carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Small cell carcinomas sometimes present as an isolated polypoid or nodular mass, but they can extensively infiltrate the bladder wall. The dome and lateral walls of the bladder are the most frequent locations, although they arise in a bladder diverticulum in approximately 5 percent of cases.</p><p>The cells are small and uniform with scant cytoplasm, nuclear molding, and nuclei with finally stippled chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitoses may be frequent, and apoptosis is common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56613 \">picture 29</a>). Approximately one-half of small cell carcinomas are associated with areas of urothelial carcinoma, and they are associated less frequently squamous cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56613 \">picture 29</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Most small cell carcinomas express synaptophysin, neuronal-specific enolase (NSE), and CD56; chromogranin is seen in approximately one-third. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is frequently positive in bladder small cell carcinoma. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic small cell carcinoma from another site, malignant lymphoma, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, plasmacytoid carcinoma, and poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">METASTATIC CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary bladder may be involved by direct extension of tumors from adjacent sites (secondary involvement) or by metastases from a distant site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Secondary tumors account for approximately 15 percent of malignant bladder tumors. Cancers extending from the colon or rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78117 \">picture 30</a>), prostate, and uterine cervix are most common and are most frequently identified in the bladder neck and trigone. Metastatic lesions from melanomas and stomach, breast, and lung cancers are less frequent.</p><p>The lesions may mimic a primary urothelial carcinoma or may manifest as multiple submucosal nodules. Multifocality, prominent vascular involvement, absence of mucosal abnormality, and unusual morphology should raise suspicion of metastatic tumors. Tumors with less characteristic histologic features, such as poorly or undifferentiated high-grade tumors, require immunohistochemical workup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder tumors are classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 schema. Within the WHO system, urothelial cancer is classified as either low grade or high grade based upon the degree of nuclear anaplasia and architectural abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p>The most important element in the pathologic staging of urothelial cancer is the extent of invasion into deeper layers of the bladder and surrounding tissues. This information has major implications for both prognosis and treatment and is incorporated into the tumor, nodes, metastasis (TNM) staging system. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic tumor staging'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>The most common bladder tumor pathologies are urothelial, squamous cell, and adenocarcinoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive urothelial carcinoma, which formerly was called transitional cell carcinoma, is characterized by invasion beyond the basement membrane. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common form of bladder cancer in the United States and Europe. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Invasive urothelial carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell carcinomas of the bladder are derived from the urothelium and are characterized by a pure squamous cell phenotype. In North America and Europe, squamous cell carcinomas comprise less than 5 percent of bladder cancers. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Squamous cell carcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenocarcinoma of the bladder is characterized histologically by a pure glandular phenotype. These tumors, which constitute approximately 2 percent of bladder cancers, most often are derived from the urothelium of the bladder and less often arise from a remnant of the urachus. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Adenocarcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Histological typing of urinary tumors, Mostofi FK, Sobin LH, Torloni H (Eds), World Health Organization, Geneva 1973.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Epstein JI, Amin MB, Reuter VR, Mostofi FK.
