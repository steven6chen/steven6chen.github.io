The reported incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications ranges from 5 to 80 percent, depending upon the patient population and the criteria used to define a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence also varies across hospitals, with one study reporting lower rates of complications in hospitals with a high volume of patients than in hospitals with a lower volume following esophagectomy, pancreatectomy, and intact abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Traditional definitions of postoperative pulmonary complications include atelectasis, bronchospasm, pneumonia, and exacerbation of chronic lung disease. However, the list can be expanded to include acute upper airway obstruction, complications from obstructive sleep apnea, pleural effusions, chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia due to abdominal compartment syndrome, and tracheal laceration or rupture. Recognition and management of these postoperative pulmonary complications are reviewed here. Their prevention is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ATELECTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atelectasis is one of the most common postoperative pulmonary complications, particularly following abdominal and thoracoabdominal procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Measures to prevent atelectasis have become an integral part of routine postoperative care, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung expansion'</a>.) This section focuses on the management of postoperative atelectasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20358221\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative atelectasis can be asymptomatic or it may manifest as increased work of breathing and hypoxemia. The onset of hypoxemia due to postoperative atelectasis tends to occur after the patient has left the post-anesthesia care unit. It typically becomes most severe during the second postoperative night and continues through the fourth or fifth postoperative night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Hypoxemia that develops earlier (ie, in the post-anesthesia care unit) should prompt the consideration of postoperative complications other than atelectasis, such as hypoventilation due to residual anesthetic effects and upper airway obstruction due to airway tissue edema. The latter may be due to the accumulation of pharyngeal secretions, prolapse of the tongue posteriorly, or tongue edema due to either surgical manipulation or an allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative atelectasis is usually caused by decreased compliance of lung tissue, impaired regional ventilation, retained airway secretions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postoperative pain that interferes with spontaneous deep breathing and coughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These complications usually do not develop immediately following surgery, which explains why the onset of hypoxemia due to postoperative atelectasis tends to occur later, after the patient has left the post-anesthesia care unit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atelectasis: Types and pathogenesis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to managing postoperative atelectasis depends upon whether the patient has abundant secretions, which we define as frequent expectoration, the expectoration of large amounts of sputum, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prominent rhonchi on auscultation. For patients without abundant secretions, continuous positive airway pressure may be beneficial. For patients with abundant secretions, chest physiotherapy and suctioning are appropriate. Some patients with abundant secretions may also benefit from bronchoscopy; the absence of air bronchograms may help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from bronchoscopy, as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3776622\"><span class=\"h3\">Few respiratory secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be beneficial to patients who develop hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased respiratory effort due to postoperative atelectasis in the setting of few secretions. This was demonstrated by a multicenter trial in which 209 patients with hypoxemia (an arterial oxygen tension to inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio [PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>]</span> of &le;300 mmHg) due to postoperative atelectasis following elective major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to receive supplemental oxygen plus CPAP or supplemental oxygen alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. CPAP decreased the incidence of endotracheal intubation (1 versus 10 percent), pneumonia (2 versus 10 percent), infection (3 versus 10 percent), and sepsis (2 versus 9 percent). The study aimed to include only patients with hypoxemia due to postoperative atelectasis, by excluding patients who were more likely to have an alternative cause of postoperative hypoxemia (eg, patients with cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, or impaired consciousness). Important limitations to this evidence are that the trial was unblinded and terminated early due to benefit. </p><p>Although these findings have not been universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], we believe the potential benefits of a trial of CPAP outweigh the risks in most patients who have hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased respiratory effort due to postoperative atelectasis without abundant respiratory secretions. We monitor patients closely during the trial of CPAP so that intubation can be performed if it becomes clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Abundant respiratory secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with clinically significant postoperative atelectasis and abundant respiratory secretions should be suctioned frequently and receive chest physiotherapy (ie, postural drainage and percussion). Oral suctioning is appropriate for patients who are able to expectorate their secretions, but many patients are unable to expectorate their secretions and require nasotracheal suctioning. Suctioning and chest physiotherapy are relatively low risk, inexpensive interventions with important potential benefits. The notion that there are potential benefits is based upon clinical experience and indirect evidence from patients with lung diseases characterized by abundant secretions (eg, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis), since there is a lack of data among postoperative patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Chest physiotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>The role of flexible bronchoscopy is uncertain. We believe that flexible bronchoscopy should not be performed routinely prior to or instead of chest physiotherapy, but may have a role in cases that are unresponsive to suctioning and chest physiotherapy. This approach is supported by the following evidence.</p><p>Several studies evaluated the use of flexible bronchoscopy to extract secretions from patients with atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The results were variable, but overall, bronchoscopy had little benefit. These results may have been due to a true lack of effect (perhaps secretions reaccumulate, rendering the bronchoscopy ineffective) or due to the study design. With respect to the study design, many studies combined patients with and without air bronchograms (air bronchograms indicate airways that are free of secretions). Flexible bronchoscopy is least effective when air bronchograms exist and it is possible that the lack of effect among patients with air bronchograms could obscure a beneficial effect among patients without air bronchograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/14,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16-18</a>]. </p><p>An illustrative trial randomly assigned 31 patients with acute lobar atelectasis following thoracic or abdominal surgery to immediate bronchoscopy followed by chest physiotherapy or chest physiotherapy alone without the initial bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Chest physiotherapy was performed every four hours and consisted of five minutes of chest percussion, five minutes of postural drainage, deep breathing to total lung capacity for three minutes with an incentive spirometer (or multiple 1 to 2 liter inflations using an anesthesia bag if the patient was intubated), coughing (or tracheal suctioning if the patient was either intubated or had an ineffective cough), and inhalation of ten breaths of isoetharine (an inhaled bronchodilator):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When patients who underwent flexible bronchoscopy followed by chest physiotherapy were compared to those who received chest physiotherapy alone, the mean percentage of resolution of volume loss following bronchoscopy was nearly identical to that following the first chest physiotherapy session, suggesting that flexible bronchoscopy did not add any initial benefit to chest physiotherapy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When patients with air bronchograms were compared to patients without air bronchograms, those without air bronchograms had better resolution of volume loss at 24 hours regardless of which intervention they received. This suggests that air bronchograms predict slower spontaneous resolution of the atelectasis.</p><p/><p>CPAP and the mucolytic, N-acetylcysteine, do not have a role in the routine management of patients with abundant respiratory secretions. Regarding CPAP, the excess secretions are a contraindication to CPAP because the patient-device interface tends to impede suctioning. Regarding N-acetylcysteine, it has not been studied as a therapy for postoperative atelectasis, but it seems unlikely that it would be beneficial given its lack of effect in preventing postoperative atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H665782\"><span class=\"h1\">BRONCHOSPASM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchospasm is common during the postoperative period. Clinical manifestations include dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, tachypnea, small tidal volumes, a prolonged expiratory time, and hypercapnia. Postoperative bronchospasm can be caused by aspiration, histamine release incited by medications (eg, opiates, tubocurarine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a>), an allergic response to medications, or an exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary condition, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It can also be caused by reflex constriction of bronchial smooth muscles due to tracheal stimulation by secretions, suctioning, endotracheal intubation, or other surgical stimulation. Reflex bronchoconstriction is particularly common when the bronchodilatory effects of inhalational anesthetics wane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Treatment of postoperative bronchospasm consists of treating the underlying cause, removing potential contributors (eg, medications), and pharmacotherapy. Short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaproterenol-orciprenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metaproterenol</a>) are bronchodilators that are considered first-line pharmacotherapy. The short-acting inhaled anticholinergic agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide, is also a bronchodilator that may have an additive effect on the degree of bronchodilation. The decision about whether to use an inhaled beta-2-agonist alone or to add ipratropium bromide is made on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the severity of bronchospasm. Patients who do not improve after one or two doses of the inhaled bronchodilators may benefit from the addition of systemic glucocorticoids. </p><p>Methylxanthines (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminophylline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>) and systemic beta-2-agonists are generally not used for the management of postoperative bronchospasm because the inhaled agents provide comparable or greater bronchodilation with fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Generally speaking, the approach to managing postoperative bronchospasm is similar to management of an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are discussed in detail separately.

It may present with fever, leukocytosis, increased secretions, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs. Hypoxemia may develop, or the patient may require more supplemental oxygen to maintain the same oxyhemoglobin saturation. Respiratory distress, dyspnea, tachypnea, small tidal volumes, and hypercapnia may also occur. The minute ventilation often increases prior to the development of any blood gas abnormalities, a consequence of the patient becoming more catabolic due to the developing infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H666181\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal strategy to diagnose postoperative pneumonia is uncertain and controversial. However, it is important because diagnosis based upon clinical criteria alone may result in over-diagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic therapy (resulting in the selection of resistant organisms), whereas stringent diagnostic criteria may lead to under-diagnosis, inadequate antibiotic coverage, and a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Generally speaking, postoperative pneumonia should be suspected in any patient who has clinical signs of infection (eg, fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and worsening oxygenation) and a new radiographic infiltrate. Patients with suspected postoperative pneumonia may be evaluated using the same diagnostic approach that is used for patients with suspected VAP, which is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of postoperative pneumonia can be difficult because there are many other postoperative causes of fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary infiltrates, such as atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and acute lung injury. This was illustrated in a prospective cohort study of 129 consecutive surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients with abnormal chest radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

It usually manifests as stridor if the obstruction is incomplete or aphonia if the obstruction is complete. Patients also may develop respiratory distress with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. Causes of acute upper airway obstruction include laryngeal edema, iatrogenic vocal cord paralysis, laryngospasm, and obstruction from the tongue or other soft tissues. </p><p>Acute upper airway obstruction is a medical emergency that requires immediate evaluation by a clinician who is capable of performing endotracheal intubation. Ideally, the clinician should have significant experience in airway management, including the ability to intubate the patient using a fiberoptic laryngoscope. Inhaled bronchodilating medications or helium-oxygen mixtures may be beneficial to patients who do not require immediate intubation, while the cause of the acute upper airway obstruction is evaluated and treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-use-of-heliox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical use of heliox&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EXACERBATION OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by apneas and hypopneas due to repetitive complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. The repetitive upper airway collapse may lead to frequent awakenings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturation. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, natural history, and management of OSA are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>OSA can be exacerbated during the postoperative period, which manifests as more frequent, more severe, or more prolonged episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep. This is often accompanied by new or worse hypercapnia. The frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturation was demonstrated by a series of 438 patients with known or suspected OSA who underwent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation to less than 90 percent during sleep occurred in 16 percent of patients, while oxyhemoglobin desaturation to less than 80 percent during sleep occurred in 7 percent of patients. These episodes usually occurred within the first 24 to 48 hours after the surgical procedure. The propensity of patients with OSA to develop postoperative hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercapnia increases the likelihood of an adverse clinical outcome, such as reintubation, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypoxic encephalopathy, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>There are several factors that probably contribute to postoperative exacerbation of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Anesthetic agents, sedatives, and opioids promote relaxation of pharyngeal muscles during sleep, which may increase the frequency, severity, and duration of upper airway collapse. Anesthetic agents may also blunt the hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory centers, thereby compromising the protective arousal response. Finally, patients are often supine following surgery and this position may predispose some patients to worse OSA. </p><p>The postoperative management of patients with known or suspected OSA is reviewed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PLEURAL EFFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small pleural effusions are common during the immediate postoperative period following abdominal surgery. This was demonstrated by a series of 200 abdominal surgery patients who had posteroanterior, left lateral, and bilateral decubitus radiographs performed 48 to 72 hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Pleural effusions were found in 97 patients (49 percent). Among the pleural effusions, 52 percent were &lt;4 mm, 27 percent were 4 to 10 mm, and 22 percent were &gt;10 mm (on the decubitus radiographs). Most effusions were exudates. A pleural effusion was more common after upper abdominal surgery, among patients with postoperative atelectasis, and among patients with free abdominal fluid. All of the effusions resolved without specific therapy with the exception of one, in which the pleural fluid culture grew Staphylococcus aureus. </p><p>Most postoperative pleural effusions resolve spontaneously within a few days and, therefore, do not require intervention. However, atypical characteristics of either the pleural effusion or the patient&rsquo;s clinical course warrant diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions. Postoperative pleural effusions are evaluated in the same way that other pleural effusions are evaluated. The diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-a-pleural-effusion-in-adults-initial-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion in adults: Initial testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Subphrenic abscess is a complication of surgery that may induce pleural effusions; however, the effusions associated with a subphrenic abscess are distinct from the usual postoperative pleural effusion in that they usually become apparent about 10 days after surgery and are typically associated with signs and symptoms of systemic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Pleural effusions that develop following cardiac surgery are discussed separately.

The clinical features of chemical pneumonitis include the abrupt onset of dyspnea and tachycardia. Patients may also exhibit fever, bronchospasm, hypoxemia, cyanosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pink frothy sputum. Infiltrates may appear in one or both lower lobes, usually within the first 24 hours. In a series of more than 172,000 consecutive adults who underwent procedures involving general anesthesia, aspiration of gastric contents occurred in 1 of every 3216 procedures with an overall mortality of 1 in 71,829 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. While the incidence of aspiration is infrequent in healthy adults, aspiration is more common in pediatric and obstetric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Most aspirations occurred during tracheal extubation or laryngoscopy; a high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class and emergency surgery were each associated with greater risk of aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 1</a>). The increased risk for aspiration and chemical pneumonitis during the perioperative period is probably related to ineffective upper airway reflexes due to the induction of anesthesia and the use of muscle relaxants and central respiratory depressant medications. </p><p>The clinical course of chemical pneumonitis varies. Full recovery is the usual outcome. In the series above, patients who did not develop a cough, wheeze, &gt;10 percent oxyhemoglobin desaturation, or radiological abnormalities within two hours of aspiration or completion of the procedure, had no respiratory sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, some patients develop a secondary bacterial infection (ie, aspiration pneumonia) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In a series of more than 300,000 adult surgical patients, the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia was 0.8 percent, which varied among hospitals and by surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The following patient characteristics were independently associated with the development of aspiration pneumonia: male gender, nonwhite race, age &gt;60 years, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, malignancy, moderate-to-severe liver disease, and emergency department admission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Witnessed aspiration of gastric secretions in the pharynx should prompt the clinician to immediately turn the patient&rsquo;s head to the side (ie, lateral head positioning), assuming integrity of the cervical spine, and then to suction the patient&rsquo;s oropharynx. Endotracheal intubation should be considered if airway reflexes are absent or compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If there is suspicion of an unwitnessed intraoperative or postoperative aspiration event, the patient should be monitored closely over the ensuing 24 to 48 hours for the development of aspiration pneumonitis. Treatment is supportive, which may include supplemental oxygen, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or conventional mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic administration of corticosteroids or antibiotics is not indicated. However, if the clinical findings have not resolved after 48 hours, antibiotic therapy may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was identified by chest radiography and elevated pulmonary artery pressures, and then confirmed at autopsy.

Patients usually present with signs of acute upper airway obstruction following extubation and, upon relief of the obstruction, immediately develop dyspnea with pink frothy sputum and bilateral infiltrates on their chest radiograph.

Thus, it is important that patients who experience postanesthetic laryngospasm be monitored longer than usual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The recommended postanesthetic monitoring period in this patient population ranges from 2 to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Pulmonary hemorrhage and frank hemoptysis have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that negative pressure pulmonary edema follows 0.05 to 0.1 percent of all procedures involving intubation and general anesthesia, but is often attributed to other etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Patients with a predisposition to upper airway obstruction are at the greatest risk for negative pressure pulmonary edema; however, laryngospasm-induced pulmonary edema following extubation has also been reported in young, healthy, athletic adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>].

It also includes previous ear, nose, and throat surgery. In one case series, patients who were extubated during Stage 2 anesthesia (as opposed to being fully awake [Stage 1 anesthesia]) were at increased risk of laryngospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The etiology of negative pressure pulmonary edema is multifactorial, but appears to be related to the generation of markedly negative intrathoracic pressure due to forced inspiration against a closed glottis, referred to as a Mueller (or reverse Valsalva) maneuver. As the intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative, blood flow to the right heart increases. This causes the pulmonary vascular bed to dilate, the interstitial pressure around the capillaries to become more negative, and intravascular fluid to be drawn into the interstitial space. This worsens gas exchange and triggers a cascade of hypoxemia, catecholamine release, and systemic and pulmonary hypertension. The result is an acute increase in afterload, which worsens transcapillary fluid efflux and increases interstitial and alveolar edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Treatment of negative pressure pulmonary edema is supportive.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atelectasis is one of the most common postoperative pulmonary complications. It can be asymptomatic or manifest as increased work of breathing and hypoxemia. Postoperative atelectasis tends to develop after the patient has left the post-anesthesia care unit. The initial approach to managing postoperative atelectasis depends upon whether the patient has abundant secretions, which we define as frequent expectoration, the expectoration of large amounts of sputum, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prominent rhonchi on auscultation (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Atelectasis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without abundant respiratory secretions who have hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased respiratory effort due to postoperative atelectasis, we suggest a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with abundant respiratory secretions and clinically significant postoperative atelectasis, we suggest frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy (ie, postural drainage and percussion) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, we suggest that bronchoscopy NOT be routinely performed as a first-line intervention prior to suctioning and chest physiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Bronchoscopy should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to suctioning and chest physiotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchospasm is common during the postoperative period. Treatment involves treating the underlying cause, removing potential contributors (eg, medications), and pharmacotherapy. For patients with postoperative bronchospasm, we recommend short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaproterenol-orciprenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metaproterenol</a>) as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The addition of a short-acting inhaled anticholinergic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>, may be beneficial if the bronchospasm is severe. (See <a href=\"#H665782\" class=\"local\">'Bronchospasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative pneumonia tends to occur within five postoperative days. It has clinical manifestations and a diagnostic approach that is nearly identical to other types of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Postoperative pneumonia is frequently caused by resistant organisms, such as Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, or multiple organisms. The management of postoperative pneumonia involves collection of respiratory specimens for microbiological analysis, followed by the initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Once the microbiological data has been reported and the patient&rsquo;s response to empiric therapy assessed, the antimicrobial regimen should be tailored. (See <a href=\"#H666174\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute upper airway obstruction typically occurs during the immediate postoperative period. It usually manifests as stridor if the obstruction is incomplete or aphonia if the obstruction is complete. Acute upper airway obstruction is a medical emergency that requires immediate evaluation by a clinician who is capable of performing endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"#H226546\" class=\"local\">'Acute upper airway obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be exacerbated during the postoperative period, which manifests as more frequent, more severe, or more prolonged episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea'</a> above.) The postoperative management of patients with known or suspected OSA is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small pleural effusions are common during the immediate postoperative period following abdominal surgery. Most resolve spontaneously within a few days and, therefore, do not require intervention. However, atypical characteristics of either the pleural effusion or the patient&rsquo;s clinical course (eg, signs of infection [fevers, chest infiltrate, worsening productive cough]) warrant diagnostic evaluation of the effusion. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Pleural effusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional postoperative pulmonary complications include chemical pneumonitis due to aspiration, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, abdominal compartment syndrome, tracheal laceration or rupture, and respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Chemical pneumonitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary edema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6689607\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary embolism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H981566\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal compartment syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Tracheal laceration or rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11830141\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Michael Johnson, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lawrence VA, Cornell JE, Smetana GW, American College of Physicians.
