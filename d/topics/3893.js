The rarity of the disease and nonspecific clinical features can result in significant delays in diagnosis. The importance of a prompt and accurate diagnosis has increased as effective therapies have become available, and diagnostic testing has evolved significantly as the molecular basis of the disease and pathogenesis of hemolysis become better understood.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PNH. Detailed discussions of PNH pathogenesis, management, and prognosis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5537352\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNH is a rare disorder. Reported incidence of clinically significant disease is in the range of 1 to 10 cases per million population, although this may be an underestimate as a subset of patients are likely to remain undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>PNH is mostly a disease of adults, although childhood cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The median age of onset is in the thirties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>PNH affects males and females nearly equally despite being caused by mutation of a gene on the X chromosome. This is because PNH results from an acquired mutation in a somatic rather than a germline cell, and somatic cells, including hematopoietic stem cells, only use one X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria#H24327574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;, section on 'PIGA gene mutation'</a>.)</p><p>PNH has been reported from almost every country in the world; there is no known ethnic or geographic distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnic/geographic</span> factors do appear to modify the risks of thrombosis and bone marrow failure in individuals with PNH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21605523\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pancytopenia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5537487\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNH is associated with a wide range of clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. In general, the severity of clinical findings is thought to correlate with the size(s) of the PNH clone(s) in untreated patients; however, some patients may be relatively asymptomatic with a large PNH clone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Many patients present with unexplained hemolytic anemia and associated symptoms, including fatigue, jaundice, and <span class=\"nowrap\">red/pink/black</span> urine. Decreased bone marrow function in some individuals may further exacerbate anemia and cause other cytopenias.</p><p>Another presentation of PNH is with a thrombosis in an atypical location such as an abdominal or cerebral vein. This is thought to be due to a hypercoagulable state induced by complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], free hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and possibly other procoagulant mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients have more unusual presentations in which nonspecific symptoms predominate. Intravascular hemolysis releases free hemoglobin into the circulation, and the resulting depletion of nitric oxide (NO) may cause symptoms of increased smooth muscle tone including dysphagia, abdominal pain, or erectile dysfunction. Over time, hemoglobinemia may also cause renal insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension. </p><p>An example of the range of findings comes from an international PNH Registry that included 1610 patients; over 93 percent were symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Quality of life was poor in many patients in this series; 23 percent had been hospitalized and 17 percent were unable to work. A retrospective review of 220 patients with PNH reported other cytopenias besides anemia (eg, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) in approximately half of patients, with a cumulative incidence of pancytopenia in 15 percent at eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classical PNH is characterized by signs and symptoms of red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In general, the degree of hemolysis correlates with the size of the erythrocyte PNH clone; however, patients with a large percentage of type II RBCs (partial absence of GPI anchored proteins) often have less hemolysis than patients with all type III RBCs (complete absence of GPI anchored proteins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Symptoms of hemolysis include those directly attributable to anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RBC lysis, as well as findings caused indirectly by hemoglobin release, such as smooth muscle dystonia, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency, and hypercoagulability. </p><p>Patients typically are anemic, but those with an adequate reticulocyte response may have normal or borderline hemoglobin and hematocrit values despite hemolysis. There may be up to a 10-fold increase in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in classic PNH, along with a reticulocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5535001\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>Hemolysis typically occurs at a low baseline level with periods of increased RBC lysis. Paroxysms of hemolysis at night leading to hemoglobinuria give the disorder its name. Episodes of hemolysis may also be triggered by various infectious or inflammatory stimuli including infections, surgery, strenuous physical activity, blood transfusion, or alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Iron repletion in an iron deficient patient can cause hemolysis by facilitating production of a large population of PNH cells highly susceptible to complement lysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria#H24327588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;, section on 'Complement-mediated hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5537517\"><span class=\"h3\">Fatigue, jaundice, red urine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with PNH have a distressing level of fatigue that may seem out of proportion to the degree of anemia. Anemia as well as the systemic effects of nitric oxide (NO) depletion may contribute independently. </p><p>Episodes of jaundice and <span class=\"nowrap\">pink/red</span> urine from hemoglobinuria may also occur during periods of intravascular hemolysis. Hemoglobinuria may be nocturnal, as the disease name implies, or it may occur at other times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21605121\"><span class=\"h3\">Smooth muscle dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of smooth muscle dystonia are seen often in PNH. The mechanism is thought to involve depletion of nitric oxide (NO) by free hemoglobin released into the circulation during episodes of hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">dysphagia/odynophagia,</span> and erectile dysfunction have been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5537529\"><span class=\"h4\">Abdominal pain/dysphagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NO relaxes smooth muscle, and its depletion results in excessive smooth muscle contraction, including smooth muscle of visceral organs and the vasculature. In PNH, the gastrointestinal tract appears to be preferentially affected. The most common gastrointestinal manifestation is esophageal spasm. Many patients with PNH complain of pressure sensations in the chest and dysphagia concurrent with episodes of hemoglobinuria. When esophageal manometry is used to assess esophageal function, peristaltic waves of great intensity appear to be generated, thereby leading to symptoms. Patients may also experience cramping abdominal pain of short duration, often in association with a hemolytic episode. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5537593\"><span class=\"h4\">Erectile dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NO also appears to be required for vascular dilatation in the corpora cavernosa. Thus, erectile dysfunction may occur, particularly during hemolytic episodes.

In a cohort of 73 patients with PNH and severe hemolysis who were enrolled in a therapeutic trial of complement therapy, elevation in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, a marker of right ventricular dysfunction, occurred in almost half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another cohort of 29 patients, nearly half had elevated pulmonary artery pressure estimations from transthoracic Doppler echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It is relatively rare as a presenting symptom (5 percent incidence in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]) but eventually occurs in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thromboses typically involve the venous rather than the arterial system, but both venous and arterial events have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Before the era of terminal complement inhibition, a large PNH clone (&gt;50 percent PNH granulocytes) was associated with an increased risk for thrombosis. </p><p>Venous thrombosis often occurs in atypical locations such as hepatic, portal, mesenteric, dermal, and cerebral veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Reviews of patients with thrombosis reported intraabdominal sites most commonly (in approximately two-thirds of patients with thrombosis), followed by intracerebral sites (10 to 20 percent), and other locations (eg, skin, lower extremity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>]. A series of 40 patients with hepatic vein thrombosis reported an ultimate diagnosis of PNH in 5 (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The presentation of thrombosis can be insidious or abrupt; some clots are discovered incidentally. Patients can present with splenomegaly due to portal vein or splenic vein thrombosis. Necrotic skin lesions may occur from dermal vein thrombosis. Asymptomatic patients with incidentally discovered venous thrombosis often have evidence of ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis with elevated D-dimer.</p><p>The major risk factor for thrombosis appears to be the size of the PNH clone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the degree of intravascular hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Individuals with PNH granulocyte clones that make up more than 60 percent of white blood cells (WBCs) appear to be at highest risk. </p><p>There appears to be an <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnic/geographic</span> component to the increased thrombotic risk, with events more common in patients from the United States (US) and Europe than in patients from other regions. As an example, a review that compared clinical features in patients from the US and Japan reported thrombosis in 34 of 176 from the US (19 percent) and 13 of 209 from Japan (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other studies from have also reported higher rates of thrombosis in the US and Europe (range: 30 to 40 percent), and lower rates in Asia (&lt;10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/7,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28-30</a>]. The explanation for the increased thrombotic risk in patients from the US and Europe is not clear; larger PNH clones or more severe hemolysis may be at least partially responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27</a>].</p><p>A study from the US also reported an especially high incidence of thrombosis in African-American and Latin-American patients with PNH compared with patients of other backgrounds from the same institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thrombosis was seen in 8 of 11 African-Americans (73 percent), four of eight Latin-Americans (50 percent), and 16 of 45 of Caucasians and Asian-Americans (36 percent). </p><p>Findings associated with specific atypical sites of venous thrombosis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatic vein</strong> &ndash; Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) may occur insidiously or suddenly, the latter often in the setting of a hemolytic episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/26,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31,32</a>]. Hepatic vein thrombosis tends to recur, ultimately causing cirrhosis and rerouting of the blood from the portal circulation. The latter change can be exacerbated by thrombosis of the portal vein, which often occurs in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The major venous sinuses (eg, superior sagittal, lateral, cavernous, sigmoid) are most often involved; thrombosis may also occur in the veins covering the cerebrum, particularly the parietal lobe. In a series of 15 patients with PNH and cerebral vein thrombosis, 12 were women (80 percent) and six (40 percent) had hormonal risk factors for thrombosis such as pregnancy or oral contraceptive use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Cerebral vein thrombosis was the presenting finding of PNH in four patients (27 percent), and three patients (20 percent) had concomitant hepatic vein thrombosis. One patient died of the cerebral vein thrombosis, but 11 were discharged without neurologic disability, and all patients who survived were functioning independently at one year after diagnosis. Additional details regarding the presentation and diagnosis of cerebral vein thrombosis are presented separately.

These patients tend to have a hypocellular bone marrow, more severe pancytopenia, a low reticulocyte count, less intravascular hemolysis, and a smaller PNH clone. Over time, the bone marrow failure may improve (especially after immunosuppressive therapy) and the PNH clone may expand, leading to signs and symptoms of classic PNH. (See <a href=\"#H8739781\" class=\"local\">'Aplastic anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Myelodysplasia with refractory anemia'</a> below.) </p><p>The frequency of underlying bone marrow failure syndromes in patients with PNH varies depending on the population.

This is explained by the different population of cells in which the <em>PIGA</em> mutation arises in MDS versus acquired AA. In patients with MDS, <em>PIGA</em> mutations arise in hematopoietic colony forming cells rather than hematopoietic stem cells. <em>PIGA</em> mutations that arise in colony forming cells cannot cause disease because colony forming cells do not self-renew and can only survive for three to four months. <em>PIGA</em> mutations can be found in up to 25 percent of patients with MDS at a frequency of 0.1 to 5 percent of granulocytes. These small PNH populations in MDS appear to be clinically irrelevant in most cases because the <em>PIGA</em> mutations in colony-forming cells.

(See <a href=\"#H27454378\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria and classification'</a> below.)</p><p>Flow cytometry is performed by incubating the patient's peripheral blood cells with fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibodies that bind to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins, which are reduced or absent on blood cells in PNH. GPI-linked proteins that can be assayed include CD59 and CD55, as well as CD14, CD15, CD16, CD24, CD45, and CD64. Each laboratory uses a defined cocktail of antibodies; most also incorporate <strong>FL</strong>uorescent <strong>AER</strong>olysin (FLAER), a reagent derived from the bacterial toxin aerolysin, which binds directly to the GPI anchor; proaerolysin is the inactive precursor of aerolysin, which also binds to GPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/13,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,73</a>]. </p><p>Typical turnaround time for flow cytometry assays is one to two days when done within an institution, and up to one week when done as a send-out test. </p><p>Since different blood cell lineages display different combinations of GPI-linked proteins, and some proteins bind to cell surfaces via both GPI-linked and GPI-independent mechanisms, it is recommended that at least <strong>two independent flow cytometry reagents</strong> be used on <strong>at least two cell lineages</strong> (eg, RBCs and WBCs) to establish the diagnosis of PNH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is consistent with consensus guidelines for detecting GPI-anchor deficient blood cells that discuss the use of FLAER in combination with several monoclonal antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Leukocytes (usually granulocytes or monocytes) are the optimal cell type for assessing the size of the PNH clone. Patients with classic PNH typically have a large percentage (40 to 99 percent) of PNH granulocytes. Patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AA) usually have a relatively small percentage (0.1 to 10 percent) of PNH granulocytes. However, patients with AA may experience clonal expansion of the PNH cells leading to an overlap condition referred to as <span class=\"nowrap\">AA/PNH</span>. (See <a href=\"#H8739781\" class=\"local\">'Aplastic anemia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Assessment of red cells should also be performed to assess the severity of disease, but testing of red cells alone is not adequate for evaluating clone size, which can be underestimated due to the short life span of PNH red cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilution of the patients cells with transfused blood from unaffected donors. Monoclonal antibodies to CD59 and CD55 are commonly used to assess cell surface GPI anchors on red cells. Many laboratories will report the percentage of type III PNH erythrocytes (absence of cell surface GPI anchored proteins), type II PNH erythrocytes (partial expression of cell surface GPI anchored proteins), and type I PNH erythrocytes (normal cell surface GPI-anchor protein expression).

Meticulous molecular and statistical analysis reveals that unlike <em>PIGA</em> mutations in PNH, most if not all of these mutations appear to arise from colony forming cells and not multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. PNH clones of less than 0.01 percent should be viewed with caution, given this background rate of GPI-anchored protein-deficient cells in the blood of healthy individuals.

Unlike classic PNH, these other syndromes are associated with bone marrow hypoplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysplasia.

Reported incidence of clinically significant disease is in the range of 1 to 10 cases per million population, although this may be an underestimate. (See <a href=\"#H5537352\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings include unexplained hemolytic anemia, thrombosis in an atypical location, or nonspecific symptoms attributable to consequences of hemolysis. In general, the severity is thought to correlate with the size(s) of the PNH clone(s) in untreated patients; however, some patients may be relatively asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H5537487\" class=\"local\">'Overview of clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemolysis may cause symptoms directly attributable to anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> red blood cell (RBC) lysis, as well as findings caused indirectly by hemoglobin release, such as smooth muscle dystonia, pulmonary hypertension, and renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hemolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thrombosis is the leading cause of death in PNH. It is relatively rare as a presenting symptom but eventually occurs in up to 40 percent of patients. The presentation of thrombosis can be insidious or abrupt; some clots are discovered incidentally. (See <a href=\"#H21605523\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pancytopenia is seen in a proportion of patients who have an overlap syndrome with bone marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia (AA) or occasionally myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Other factors that may cause or exacerbate cytopenias include iron deficiency and hypersplenism. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pancytopenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory findings in PNH include typical findings of hemolytic anemia, loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, and findings associated with organ damage from hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H5535001\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bone marrow examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging for thromboses are not routinely performed or required for the diagnosis of PNH. However, bone marrow should be examined in patients with significant pancytopenia; and imaging for thrombosis should be performed in patients with intractable headache or severe abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"#H19065241\" class=\"local\">'Findings on bone marrow examination and imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for PNH is appropriate in patients with a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) negative hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, refractory anemia, or unexplained thrombosis in conjunction with cytopenias or hemolysis. The typical evaluation involves initial testing to determine that the patient has a hemolytic anemia; and to eliminate autoimmune, microangiopathic, and mechanical causes of hemolysis. Flow cytometry is then used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PNH. (See <a href=\"#H5534240\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of PNH includes other hemolytic anemias, other causes of venous thrombosis in atypical sites, and other bone marrow failure syndromes, which can also coexist with PNH. Hematuria and myoglobinuria may also be mistaken for hemoglobinuria. (See <a href=\"#H132693\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis and management of PNH are discussed in detail separately.
