In a multicenter surveillance study conducted in the United States between 2004 and 2008, 54 percent of 2019 bloodstream isolates represented non-albicans <em>Candida</em> spp and 46 percent represented <em>C. albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <em>C. glabrata</em> was responsible for 26 percent of all cases of candidemia, followed by <em>C. parapsilosis</em> (16 percent), <em>C. tropicalis</em> (8 percent), and <em>C. krusei</em> (3 percent). Other studies have shown a similar order of frequency, although the incidence of each species varies in different patient populations and geographic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults/abstract/16,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19-23</a>].

For many patients, candidemia is a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis, whereas for others it reflects colonization of an indwelling intravenous catheter. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidiasis is an increasingly important nosocomial infection in both adults and children, especially those who are cared for in intensive care units (ICUs). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the infecting strain is most often part of the host's endogenous flora, nosocomial acquisition of <em>Candida</em> species has been described. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There has been increased isolation of non-albicans species of <em>Candida</em> from bloodstream infections. Most prominent have been <em>C. glabrata</em> and <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, followed by <em>C. tropicalis</em> and <em>C. krusei</em>. All <em>C. krusei </em>are fluconazole-resistant, and an increasing proportion of <em>C. glabrata</em> are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> resistant. In addition, echinocandin resistance among <em>C. glabrata</em> isolates is being reported with increasing frequency from certain medical centers. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of Candida species'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health England issued warnings about the emergence of a multidrug-resistant <em>Candida</em> species, <em>C. auris. </em>It has been detected in over a dozen countries on five continents and has been associated with outbreaks at healthcare facilities. (See <a href=\"#H2316358869\" class=\"local\">'Emergence of C. auris'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in the ICU and those who are immunocompromised (eg, patients with hematologic malignancies, solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are most at risk for the development of candidemia. Host-specific polymorphisms in toll-like receptors and cytokine pathways likely play a role in determining development of infection with <em>Candida</em> species. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three major routes by which <em>Candida</em> gain access to the bloodstream: through the gastrointestinal tract mucosal barrier, via an intravascular catheter, and from a localized focus of infection, such as pyelonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetration through the gastrointestinal tract mucosa is probably the most common mechanism for <em>Candida</em> species to enter the bloodstream in both immunocompromised patients (eg, those receiving chemotherapy who are neutropenic) and in ICU patients. <em>Candida</em> species are part of the normal bowel microbiota; many factors lead to overgrowth of yeasts and subsequent egress out of the bowel into the blood. Chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt the intestinal mucosa play a major role in allowing <em>Candida</em> to escape from the bowel in patients with hematologic malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular catheters, especially central venous catheters, continue to be an important source for <em>Candida</em> bloodstream infection. <em>Candida</em> colonization of indwelling vascular devices, especially central catheters, can occur at either the insertion site or the hub and lead to subsequent candidemia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Intravascular catheters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonization with <em>Candida</em> species is almost always a necessary prerequisite for candidemia and invasive candidiasis. However, colonization alone does not predict which patients will develop fungemia. Other risk factors are needed in addition to colonization. Even with risk factors and colonization with <em>Candida</em> species, most patients do not become candidemic. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Colonization'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fridkin SK.
