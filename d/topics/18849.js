It is speculated that elevated BP in these patients without renal artery stenosis is a reflection of a physiological adaptation to abnormal vasculature even in the absence of renal artery or abdominal aorta stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/williams-beuren-syndrome-renal-manifestations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The arteriopathy is due to decreased arterial elasticity and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cell and increased media-to-intima thickness that are caused by defects in the elastin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/williams-beuren-syndrome-renal-manifestations/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].

As a result, this therapeutic approach is <strong>not</strong> recommended in infants and young children.

Serum creatinine levels should be routinely monitored; the frequency of testing is dependent upon whether there is evidence of renal impairment. In particular, patients with hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys should be followed for the progression of chronic kidney disease.

These findings suggest that a voiding history should be included in the evaluation of patients with WBS. Further diagnostic evaluation including voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urodynamic studies should be considered in symptomatic patients.

However, the results of surgical repair or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty are poor with either persistent hypertension or recurrence of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/williams-beuren-syndrome-renal-manifestations/abstract/26,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,32,33</a>]. As a result, some experts, including the author, recommend an initial trial of antihypertensive medications and reserve evaluation for renovascular causes for those patients resistant to pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/williams-beuren-syndrome-renal-manifestations/abstract/10,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32</a>], because a specific lesion is often not found and may not be responsive to subsequent interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/williams-beuren-syndrome-renal-manifestations/abstract/10,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32</a>]. However, other experts in the field would evaluate all patients with hypertension for an underlying renovascular etiology.</p><p>In patients with WBS, effective control of hypertension has been reported with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and beta blockers. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may also be effective, but should not be used if there is any suspicion of middle aortic syndrome or bilateral renal artery stenosis as they may compromise renal function due to a reduction in renal perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney&quot;, section on 'Medical therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we begin therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amlodipine</a> or sustained-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nifedipine</a> (dihydropyridine CCBs), in patients whose initial work-up for hypertension is negative or inconclusive. If blood pressure cannot be controlled with a single agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">labetalol</a> (or other beta-blocking drug) can be added. If hypertension remains difficult to control on both a CCB and a beta blocker, the choice of a third antihypertensive agent will depend on the unique situation of an individual patient. If reasonably confident that hypertension is not related to renal artery stenosis, ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be introduced with careful monitoring of renal function. Other third-line medications may include diuretics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">minoxidil</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>. Further evaluation is generally indicated for patients who are refractory to pharmacologic therapy with three agents.</p><p>Arteriography, an invasive procedure, is the gold standard to diagnose renovascular hypertension and is performed in patients with refractory hypertension. If available computed tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography can usually provide sufficient information to guide decision about further interventions.
