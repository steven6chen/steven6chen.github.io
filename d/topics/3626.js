More broadly, burns result from traumatic injuries to the skin or other tissues primarily caused by thermal or other acute exposures. Burns occur when some or all of the cells in the skin or other tissues are destroyed by heat, electrical discharge, friction, chemicals, or radiation. Burns are acute wounds caused by an isolated, non-recurring insult, and healing ideally progresses rapidly through an orderly series of steps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms that result in burns and their classification will be reviewed here. The clinical assessment and management of burns in adults and children are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minor-thermal-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minor thermal burns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of superficial burns requiring hospital admission&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of the severely burned patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BURN MECHANISMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The depth of the thermal injury is related to contact temperature, duration of contact of the external heat source, and the thickness of the skin. Because the thermal conductivity of skin is low, most thermal burns involve the epidermis and part of the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common thermal burns are associated with flames, hot liquids, hot solid objects, and steam. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961143777\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrical discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrical energy is transformed into heat as the current passes through poorly conducting body tissues. Electroporation (injury to cell membranes) disrupts membrane potential and function. The magnitude of the injury depends on the pathway of the current, the resistance to the current flow through the tissues, and the strength and duration of the current flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=environmental-and-weapon-related-electrical-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Environmental and weapon-related electrical injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1591803399\"><span class=\"h2\">Friction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury from friction can occur due to a combination of mechanical disruption of tissues as well as heat generated by friction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemicals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury is caused by a wide range of caustic reactions, including alteration of pH, disruption of cellular membranes, and direct toxic effects on metabolic processes. In addition to the duration of exposure, the nature of the agent will determine injury severity. Contact with acid causes coagulation necrosis of the tissue, while alkaline burns generate liquefaction necrosis. Systemic absorption of some chemicals is life-threatening, and local damage can include the full thickness of skin and underlying tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-chemical-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical chemical burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radio frequency energy or ionizing radiation can cause damage to skin and tissues. The most common type of radiation burn is the sunburn. Radiation burns are most commonly seen today following therapeutic radiation therapy and are also seen in patients who receive excessive radiation from diagnostic procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiation burns can be seen in individuals who work in the nuclear industry. Radiation burns are often associated with cancer due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage DNA. The clinical results of ionizing radiation depend on the dose, time of exposure, and type of particle that determines the depth of exposure. Depending on the photon energy, radiation can cause very deep internal burns. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION BY DEPTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous burns are classified according to the depth of tissue injury. The depth of the burn largely determines the healing potential and the need for surgical grafting. </p><p>The traditional classification of burns as first, second, third, or fourth degree was replaced by a system reflecting the need for surgical intervention. Current designations of burn depth are superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, and full-thickness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61540 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73309 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term fourth degree is still used to describe the most severe burns, burns that extend beyond the skin into the subcutaneous soft tissue and can involve underlying vessels, nerves, muscle, bone, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joints.</p><p>Burn wounds are not usually uniform in depth, and many have a mixture of deep and superficial components. A precise assessment of the depth of the burn wound may be difficult initially as burn wounds are dynamic and can progress as well as convert to deeper wounds, and as such may require several days for a final determination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Thin skin, particularly on the volar surfaces of the forearms, medial thighs, perineum, and ears, sustains deeper burn injuries than suggested by initial appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is best to assume there are no shallow burns in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Children under the age of five and adults over the age of 55 are also more susceptible to deeper burns because of thinner skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Appropriate burn wound care may necessitate multiple treatment modalities for different parts of a burn wound depending on the burn depth of each injured part.</p><p>The American Burn Association (ABA) has published an educational resource that reviewed the classification and management of the burn wound. The classification system below is largely in agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial or epidermal burns involve only the epidermal layer of skin. They do not blister but are painful, dry, red, and blanch with pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55928 \">picture 1</a>). Over the next two to three days the pain and erythema subside, and by approximately day 4, the injured epithelium peels away from the newly healed epidermis. Such injuries are generally healed in six days without scarring. This process is commonly seen with sunburns. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial-thickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial-thickness burns involve the epidermis and portions of the dermis. They are characterized as either superficial or deep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial partial thickness &ndash; These burns characteristically form blisters within 24 hours between the epidermis and dermis. They are painful, red, and weeping and blanch with pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75398\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75398 \">picture 2</a>). Burns that initially appear to be only epidermal in depth may be determined to be partial-thickness 12 to 24 hours later. These burns generally heal in 7 to 21 days; scarring is unusual, although pigment changes may occur. A layer of fibrinous exudates and necrotic debris may accumulate on the surface, which may predispose the burn wound to heavy bacterial colonization and delayed healing. These burns typically heal without functional impairment or hypertrophic scarring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep partial thickness &ndash; These burns extend into the deeper dermis and are characteristically different from superficial partial-thickness burns. Deep burns damage hair follicles and glandular tissue. They are painful to pressure only, almost always blister (easily unroofed), are wet or waxy dry, and have variable mottled colorization from patchy cheesy white to red (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57851 \">picture 3</a>). They do not blanch with pressure. If infection is prevented and wounds are allowed to heal spontaneously without grafting, they will heal in three to nine weeks. These burns invariably cause hypertrophic scarring. If they involve a joint, joint dysfunction is expected even with aggressive physical therapy. A deep partial-thickness burn that fails to heal in three weeks is functionally and cosmetically equivalent to a full-thickness burn. Differentiation from full-thickness burns is often difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Full-thickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These burns extend through and destroy all layers of the dermis and often injure the underlying subcutaneous tissue. Burn eschar, the dead and denatured dermis, is usually intact. The eschar can compromise the viability of a limb or torso if circumferential.</p><p>Full-thickness burns are usually anesthetic or hypo-aesthetic. Skin appearance can vary from waxy white to leathery gray to charred and black. The skin is dry and inelastic and does not blanch with pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61036\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61036 \">picture 4</a>). Hairs can easily be pulled from hair follicles. Vesicles and blisters do not develop.</p><p>Pale full-thickness burns may simulate normal skin except that the skin does not blanch with pressure. Features that differentiate partial-thickness from full-thickness burns may take some time to develop.</p><p>The eschar eventually separates from the underlying tissue and reveals an unhealed bed of granulation tissue. Without surgery, these wounds heal by wound contracture with epithelialization around the wound edges. Scarring is severe with contractures; complete spontaneous healing is not possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Extension to deep tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fourth-degree burns are deep and potentially life-threatening injuries that extend through the skin into underlying soft tissue and can involve muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENT OF BURN INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough and accurate estimation of burn size is essential to guide therapy and to determine when to transfer a patient to a burn center. Using one of the methods described below, the extent of burns is estimated and expressed as the total percentage of body surface area (ie, TBSA). Superficial (first-degree) burns are <strong>not</strong> included in percentage TBSA burn assessment. </p><p>The location of partial-thickness and full-thickness burned areas are recorded on a burn diagram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 2</a>). Burns with an appearance compatible with either deep partial-thickness or full-thickness are presumed to be full-thickness until accurate differentiation is possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H759874080\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods of estimation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two commonly used methods of assessing percentage TBSA in adults are the Lund-Browder chart and &quot;Rule of Nines.&quot; The Lund-Browder chart is the recommended method in children because it considers the relative percentage of body surface area affected by growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. If the burn is irregular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patchy, the palm method may be more useful. </p><p>Superficial (first-degree) burns are <strong>not</strong> included in percentage TBSA burn assessment. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lund-Browder &ndash; The Lund-Browder chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 2</a>) is the most accurate method for estimating TBSA for both adults and children. Children have proportionally larger heads and smaller lower extremities, so the percentage TBSA is more accurately estimated using the Lund-Browder chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50237\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50237 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rule of Nines &ndash; For adult assessment, the most expeditious method to estimate TBSA in adults is the &quot;Rule of Nines&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The head represents 9 percent TBSA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Each arm represents 9 percent TBSA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Each leg represents 18 percent TBSA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The anterior and posterior trunk each represent 18 percent TBSA</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palm method &ndash; Small or patchy burns can be approximated by using the surface area of the patient's palm. The palm of the patient's hand, excluding the fingers, is approximately 0.5 percent of total body surface area, and the entire palmar surface including fingers is 1 percent in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2639827899\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy of percentage TBSA estimates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several observational reports comparing the estimation of burn size at the referring hospital with the estimation at the receiving burn center, the size of larger burns was underestimated. This resulted in underresuscitation at the referring hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Early transfer to a burn center should be arranged when injuries meet the criteria for major burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial assessment and treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The percentage TBSA burned may be underestimated in women with large breasts who have burns of the anterior trunk. A table based on the cup size of a brassiere is intended to complement the Lund-Browder chart for burn estimation in adults. In a review of 60 volunteers to determine the difference in percentage TBSA of the anterior trunk between men and women, large-breasted women (cup size D and greater) were found to have a significantly greater amount of percentage TBSA on the anterior chest compared with men (16 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This additional percentage TBSA is concentrated on the pectoral region and represents 10 percent of TBSA as compared with 5 percent for men and 7 percent for women with smaller breasts. There was an equal distribution of anterior and posterior trunk TBSA in men but a 1.6:1 ratio in large-breasted women. For every increase in cup size, the TBSA of a woman's anterior trunk increases by a factor of 0.1, relative to the posterior trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59647\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59647 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>In addition, a study in obese patients suggested that both the Rule of Nines and Lund-Browder diagrams underestimate the extent of burns involving the torso and overestimate the percentage of burns involving the extremities in the obese patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-burn-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this study, the patient's primary shape (android versus gynecoid) was important for determining the percentage TBSA in comparison to body mass index (BMI) and gender. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3068589719\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC LOCATION OF BURN INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of a burn often directs treatment. Burns on the face, hands, feet, and genitalia as well as large burns in other areas of the body and those associated with inhalational injury are often referred to burn centers for specialized expertise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head and neck &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: Face, scalp, and neck&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremities &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: Extremities and regional nodal basins&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary operative management of hand burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trunk &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: The female breast&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: Perineum and genitalia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory tract &ndash; Superheated gases can cause burns to the respiratory system. More commonly, injury occurs from smoke exerting its effects through local chemical irritation. In addition, chemicals such as carbon monoxide or cyanide can lead to systemic toxicity.
