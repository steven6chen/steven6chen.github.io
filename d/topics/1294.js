Unless otherwise specified, these guidelines are based on our clinical experience.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish a trusting clinician-patient relationship &ndash; A trusted clinician may be better able to explain to the patient why an indicated procedure is necessary and to reassure him or her of its safety. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educate the patient about their condition, reasons the procedure is recommended, and what he or she can expect, eg, about the expected amount of pain.

Avoid telling patients not to worry as this may undermine their concerns and imply that they are able to stop their worries at will. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide patients with as much control as possible during the procedure<strong> &ndash; </strong>This may include assuring the patient that nothing will happen during the procedure that is not agreed upon in advance.<strong> </strong>Allow the patient to interrupt or end the procedure if anxiety becomes intolerable, as long as it is safe to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make the patient as comfortable as possible during the procedure. As an example, allow family members or friends to be present during the procedure if desired by the patient and not clinically contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4285656868\"><span class=\"h1\">DENTAL PHOBIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental phobia, the fear and frequent avoidance of going to the dentist, can be treated with psychotherapeutic interventions or with medication-induced sedation.<strong> </strong>Despite the availability of treatments with evidence of efficacy, more acceptable and tolerable treatments are needed, including interventions to enhance patient motivation to seek and stay in treatment. Drop-out rates in clinical trials of psychotherapies and medications in dental phobia are among the highest among subtypes of specific phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>],<strong> </strong>ranging from 44 to 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation#H2928855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute procedure anxiety in adults: Epidemiology and clinical presentation&quot;, section on 'Dental phobia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1554429248\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most cases of dental phobia, we suggest in vivo exposure as first-line treatment rather than other interventions. There are no clinical trials comparing exposure therapy with other psychotherapies in dental phobia. Based on our clinical experience and comparisons of placebo-controlled trials across these interventions, exposure therapy appears to be the most effective psychosocial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H607337129\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapies'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no evidence of differential efficacy between psychotherapy and sedating medication in dental phobia, but impairing side effects of some medications, eg, benzodiazepines, can last hours after the procedure. Dental care is a recurring need, and limited evidence suggests that psychotherapy may have longer-lasting effects compared with medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, a trial of pretreatment prior to oral surgery randomly assigned 91 patients with dental anxiety to receive either psychotherapy consisting of information, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, and applied relaxation, to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> or to no pretreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients receiving either psychotherapy or midazolam experienced reduced anxiety prior to surgery compared with the control group. At follow-up two months after surgery, patients treated with psychotherapy were more likely to have received continued dental treatment compared with patients treated with midazolam (70 versus 20 percent). On assessment one year after the surgery, only the group that received psychotherapy maintained benefit from treatment. (See <a href=\"#H607337129\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H607337171\" class=\"local\">'Medication'</a> below.)</p><p>In vivo exposure can be provided as an independent modality or within the context of a broader cognitive behavioral therapy. Although there is a lack of supporting evidence from clinical trials, in our clinical experience, it may be useful to augment exposure therapy with cognitive restructuring or relaxation training. (See <a href=\"#H607337136\" class=\"local\">'In vivo exposure therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1367871882\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients prefer medication to psychotherapy. For these patients and those with the indications below, in the absence of strong evidence of differential efficacy, first-line treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> is a reasonable alternative to exposure therapy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack access to exposure therapy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need dental treatment on an emergent basis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experience anxiety that is too severe to tolerate exposure therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failed previous, adequate trial of exposure therapy</p><p/><p>Other medications for dental phobia have disadvantages compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>. The sedating effects of benzodiazepines can last for hours compared with minutes for nitrous oxide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F71754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71754 \">table 1</a>) and can be accompanied by psychomotor impairment. General anesthesia with deep sedation requires intensive monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory functions and other vital physiological parameters by a trained clinician. It should be reserved as a last resort when other forms of sedation are not an option or not effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Indications favoring general anesthesia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe anxiety that is not controlled by other forms of sedation methods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to tolerate other forms of sedation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are not able to cooperate or communicate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for dental surgery or treatment requiring multiple sessions with other sedation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607337129\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychotherapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small clinical trials support the efficacy of cognitive and behavioral therapies in the treatment of dental phobia. In the absence of comparative trials, our clinical experience favors in vivo exposure (a behavioral therapy), with or without a cognitive component, to treat dental phobia. Trials of psychotherapy for dental phobia are limited by variations in the definition of dental phobia and in other inclusion criteria, assessment methods, and treatment components. These therapies are reviewed below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1367871882\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that incorporates psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral intervention to reduce symptoms of anxiety. Behavioral interventions may include various forms of exposure therapy or relaxation training. (See <a href=\"#H607337143\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive restructuring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H607337136\" class=\"local\">'In vivo exposure therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>A trial suggested that brief CBT may be an efficacious treatment for dental phobia. The trial randomly assigned 104 patients with dental phobia to two to four sessions of CBT or to a wait-list control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The brief CBT was administered by a dentist and included in vivo exposure to the patient&rsquo;s most feared aspect of dental treatment. Only 60 percent of the patients completed the trial. Patients receiving CBT reported decreased dental fear compared with those in the control group; the effects were maintained at two years. An intent to treat analysis was not reported.</p><p>Brief CBT delivered via a computer application may also have benefits for patients with dental phobia. A trial randomly assigned 151 patients with the disorder to a one-hour computer-based CBT intervention immediately prior to their dental appointment or to a control group that received no treatment prior to the appointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients who received CBT reported decreased dental anxiety and avoidance posttreatment and at one-month follow-up. Among patients who initially met DSM-IV criteria for dental phobia at enrollment, those who received CBT were less likely to meet diagnostic criteria for dental phobia at one-month follow-up compared with those assigned to the control condition (51.4 versus 74.4 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3651621042\"><span class=\"h4\">Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of CBT treatment that incorporates saccadic eye movements during exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. EMDR has been found to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in several randomized trials, though some researchers have suggested that exposure is the active component of EMDR, and eye movements may not be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>EMDR may be efficacious in the treatment of dental anxiety. A trial randomly assigned 31 patients with dental phobia and a history of prior traumatic dental treatment to EMDR or a waitlist control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. After three months, patients receiving EMDR experienced reduced dental anxiety and avoidance behavior compared with the waitlisted group, an effect that was maintained at 12 months. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607337136\"><span class=\"h3\">In vivo exposure therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure-based strategies involve repeated, systematic confrontation of the feared stimulus to facilitate fear reduction through extinction learning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients are exposed to feared situations from least to most feared and avoided. In vivo exposure involves experiencing the stimulus in real world situations in a safe and controlled manner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-behavioral-therapies-for-specific-phobia-in-adults#H6645415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive-behavioral therapies for specific phobia in adults&quot;, section on 'Exposure therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Exposure therapy can be delivered as an isolated intervention or as part of a multi-modal CBT. (See <a href=\"#H1367871882\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>A single randomied trial of 40 patients with dental phobia found that treatment with in vivo exposure therapy resulted in decreased anxiety, increased positive thinking and decreased negative thinking about dental treatment, and decreased avoidance of dental treatment compared with a waitlist control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Mean absence of dental care before treatment was 11.4 years. In the year following treatment with exposure therapy, a total of 77 percent of patients sought dental care. Individuals assigned to receive five sessions of exposure therapy experienced greater reduction of dental anxiety compared with patients treated with a single session, but avoidance behavior post-treatment did not differ between the two groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607337143\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive restructuring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive restructuring involves the identification and modification of overly negative cognitions regarding the feared stimulus. Cognitive restructuring can be delivered as an isolated intervention or as part of a multi-modal CBT. (See <a href=\"#H1367871882\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Evidence from a single clinical trial does not support cognitive restructuring as monotherapy for dental phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 52 patients with dental phobia to receive a one-hour session of cognitive restructuring, provision of information about dental <span class=\"nowrap\">health/treatment,</span> or a wait-list control condition. The cognitive intervention was more effective than the control conditions in reducing dental anxiety and decreasing the frequency and believability of negative thoughts about dental treatment. However, patients receiving cognitive therapy still had moderate anxiety post-treatment and only 33 percent were considered to be clinically improved.<strong> </strong>After one year, there was no difference in dental anxiety between patients who did or did not receive the cognitive intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607337150\"><span class=\"h3\">Systematic desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic desensitization involves imaginal exposure to the feared stimulus coupled with muscle relaxation to cope with the anxiety. Clinical trials suggest that systematic desensitization is more efficacious than a control condition, but less efficacious than in vivo exposure in specific phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/6,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,22</a>]; the intervention has largely been supplanted by exposure therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-behavioral-therapies-for-specific-phobia-in-adults#H2138754810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive-behavioral therapies for specific phobia in adults&quot;, section on 'Systematic desensitization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607337157\"><span class=\"h3\">Coping strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coping strategies used to treat dental anxiety include progressive muscle relaxation and applied relaxation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H833648885\"><span class=\"h4\">Progressive muscle relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common relaxation technique is progressive muscle relaxation, in which patients are instructed to practice tensing (five seconds) and relaxing (10 seconds) different muscle groups starting from top of the head down to the toes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This exercise takes about 15 minutes and is practiced twice a day for one to two weeks until proficient. Then the tension part is eliminated and release-only relaxation of different muscle groups is practiced, which takes five to seven minutes. This is then followed by conditioned relaxation, in which the patients learn to relax the whole body at once on cue using the self-instruction &ldquo;relax,&rdquo; which further reduces relaxation to 30 seconds. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951209007\"><span class=\"h4\">Applied relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In applied relaxation, patients are taught to apply the skills of relaxation to anxiety-provoking situations as a coping strategy to counteract the physiological arousal experienced when anxious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients are instructed first to relax on cue many times a day (15 to 20 times) to daily nonstressful situations. Then, they practice in anxiety-provoking situations. Patients are taught to recognize early signs of anxiety and apply relaxation even before entering an anxious situation. In contrast to in vivo exposure therapy in which patients remain in the anxiety provoking situation for a prolonged period of time (up to one to two hours) with the goal of <span class=\"nowrap\">habituation/extinction</span> of the physiological arousal elicited, exposure in applied relaxation is much briefer (10 to 15 minutes) with the goal of coping with anxiety encountered in natural situations.</p><p>Relaxation therapy, a variation of applied relaxation, was more efficacious in reducing dental and overall anxiety compared with cognitive therapy in a randomized trial of 112 adults with dental phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the relaxation therapy condition, patients were trained in progressive muscle relaxation with the aid of electromyographic biofeedback to increase the patient&rsquo;s ability to relax. Once proficiency in muscle relaxation was achieved, patients were trained to maintain relaxation during exposure to successively more anxiety-provoking dental situations (first video scenes, then progress to handling dental instruments). Although relaxation treatment was more effective, treatment completion rate was higher in the cognitive group compared with the relaxation group (74 versus 59 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607337164\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypnotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnotherapy for dental anxiety includes the following components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive relaxation (see <a href=\"#H833648885\" class=\"local\">'Progressive muscle relaxation'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggestions for deepening the hypnotic state, relaxation, and comfort</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instructions to the patient to imagine dental scenes and procedures in a successively more anxiety-provoking hierarchy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggestions to the patient, when in a stage of hypnosis, that he or she would no longer be afraid of the imagined dental situations</p><p/><p>Clinical trials of hypnotherapy for dental anxiety do not show evidence of efficacy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial of 174 patients with dental phobia compared hypnotherapy with systematic desensitization, group therapy, or a waiting list control, finding that all three treatments led to similar reductions of anxiety compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Applied tension involves repeatedly tensing body muscles to increase blood pressure and prevent fainting when in the presence of the phobic stimulus (ie, with in vivo exposure). </p><p>In treatment with applied tension, the patient is instructed to tense the muscles in their arms, torso and legs and hold the tension until a warm feeling is experienced in the head, typically 10 to 15 seconds. The patient then releases the tension and waits for 20 to 30 seconds for the body to return to normal. The patient then practices this tension-release cycle repeatedly until he or she becomes skilled in the technique. Once the technique is mastered, the patient is instructed to use the technique in response to the early signs of a drop in blood pressure (eg, lightheadedness) during exposure practice to feared situations. </p><p>Several small randomized trials found that applied tension was more effective in blood-injection-injury type phobia compared with exposure alone or muscle tension alone, leading to reduced anxiety, avoidance, and fainting.
