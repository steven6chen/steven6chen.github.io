Laryngitis usually causes your voice to sound hoarse and can even make you lose your voice completely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598698\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes laryngitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngitis can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The common cold and other infections that affect the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shouting or straining your voice too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing in harsh chemicals, such as cleaners or gasoline</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking too much alcohol or smoking a lot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid reflux, which is when the acid from your stomach leaks into your throat</p><p/><p>There are also medical problems besides laryngitis that can make your voice hoarse or make you lose your voice. For example, people can have these symptoms because of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal growths on the vocal cords</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle disorders affecting the voice box (such as spasmodic dysphonia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the throat</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598713\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of laryngitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are different things you can do, depending on what caused your laryngitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your laryngitis happened because you strained your voice too much, give your voice a rest. If you are a singer or need to use your voice for work, you might want to think about taking voice lessons to learn how to protect your voice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your laryngitis was caused by smoking or drinking, limit how much you smoke or drink. Better yet, quit smoking completely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your laryngitis was caused by breathing in a harsh chemical, avoid the chemical. If that is not possible, at least make sure there is a lot fresh air coming in when you are dealing with fumes. If you work near chemical fumes that are making you hoarse, speak with your employer about getting masks or ventilation fans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your laryngitis was caused by acid reflux, take steps to avoid acid reflux. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Take medicines for acid reflux, if your doctor recommends them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid foods that make your symptoms worse. (Common examples include alcohol, coffee, and chocolate.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat many small meals each day, rather than 2 or 3 big meals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not lie down for at least 3 hours after finishing a meal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598728\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on how long your symptoms last and whether you have symptoms besides hoarseness.</p><p>Most people with laryngitis get better on their own within 2 to 3 weeks. If your voice is hoarse or gone for 2 weeks or longer, and you do not seem to be getting better, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p>You should also see a doctor or nurse if you have a sore throat and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever of at least 101&deg;F or 38.4&deg;C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your throat pain is severe or does not start to improve within 5 to 7 days</p><p/><p>Call an ambulance (dial 9-1-1 in the US and Canada) or go to the emergency room if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are drooling because you cannot swallow your saliva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have swelling of the neck or tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot move your neck or have trouble opening your mouth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598743\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If your doctor or nurse is not sure what is causing your symptoms, you might need tests. For example, you might have a laryngoscopy, which is when the doctor puts a tube with a tiny camera down your throat to look at your voice box.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598758\"><span class=\"h1\">How is laryngitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing it. If your laryngitis is caused by a cold or other minor infection, you might not need treatment. If you do not get better in 2 weeks, there might be something else causing your hoarseness. Other causes of laryngitis are treated on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598773\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child gets laryngitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the same things that cause laryngitis in adults can cause it children, too. For instance, children can get laryngitis because of a throat infection or common cold, because of acid reflux, or because they strain their voice too much. But in children, sounding hoarse can have lots of other causes. For example, children sometimes develop bumps on their vocal cords or have birth defects affecting their voice box.</p><p>See a doctor or nurse right away if your child has trouble breathing or has pain or other symptoms that seem to be quickly getting worse. You should also see a doctor or nurse if your child has laryngitis for more than 2 weeks, or if the laryngitis is getting worse or is making it hard for your child to interact with others. If your child has laryngitis or throat discomfort or pain that gets better and comes back, see a doctor or nurse. If your child is a baby, call the baby's doctor as soon as you notice symptoms. The doctor will tell you what to do for your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262598788\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=strep-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Strep throat in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngeal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Laryngeal cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=throat-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Throat cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spasmodic-dysphonia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spasmodic dysphonia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
