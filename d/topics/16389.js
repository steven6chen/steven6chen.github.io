It causes the skin to turn red or purple and to peel away from the body. It can affect the skin on the outside of the body, as well as the pink, moist skin that lines your mouth, nose, eyes, genitals, and other body parts.</p><p>A more severe form of SJS is called &quot;toxic epidermal necrolysis&quot; or &quot;TEN.&quot; Both conditions are treated in very much the same way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875877\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of SJS/TEN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> are those that affect the skin. In the first few days, before the skin symptoms show up, <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> causes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (often higher than 102&deg;F or 39&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu-like illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching or burning eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p/><p>Later, the symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patches of red and painful skin &ndash; The patches might look darker in the middle and lighter around the outside</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruises that can have a blister on top</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blisters or peeling skin on the chest, face, palms of hands, or soles of feet</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sores, swelling, and crusting on the pink, moist skin lining the mouth, eyes, vagina, penis, lungs, and other areas &ndash; This can lead to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The eyes getting red and watering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parts of the eye sticking to each other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain with urination or trouble urinating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble breathing, fluid build-up in the lungs, or lung infections</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875892\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes SJS/TEN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> is a rare side effect of a medicine that cannot be predicted. But it can also happen to people who have an infection, such as HIV. <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> can sometimes happen in children who have certain infections, too.</p><p>There are many medicines that can cause <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span>. The chance that one of these medicines will cause SJS is highest during the first 8 to 10 weeks of taking it. Some of the most common examples of medicines that can cause <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F97285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97285 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medicine used to treat gout called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">allopurinol</a> (brand names: Aloprim, Zyloprim, Duzallo)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some medicines used to treat infections, especially:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, also called co-trimoxazole or TMP-SMX, and other &quot;sulfa&quot; drugs (sample brand names: Bactrim DS, Septra, Sulfatrim, Pediazole)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Nevirapine</a> (brand name: Viramune), which is an HIV medicine that is not used often in most countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines used to prevent seizures, pain, or other conditions, called &quot;anti-epileptics,&quot; including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Carbamazepine</a> (sample brand names: Tegretol, Carbatrol)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Phenytoin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fosphenytoin</a> (brand names: Dilantin, Phenytek, Cerebyx)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Lamotrigine</a> (brand name: Lamictal)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Phenobarbital</a> (brand names: Luminal, Donnatol)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines used to treat pain called &quot;non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents,&quot; or &quot;NSAIDs,&quot; especially:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meloxicam-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Meloxicam</a> (sample brand name: Mobic, Vivlodex)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Piroxicam</a> (brand name: Feldene)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenoxicam-united-states-not-available-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Tenoxicam</a> (brand name depends on country)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875907\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you develop symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN,</span> go to the emergency room right away or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875922\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor might be able to tell what is wrong by talking to you and doing an exam. But he or she might order tests to make sure something else is not causing your symptoms. For instance, the doctor might take a sample of skin (called a biopsy) and send it the lab. He or she might also order a blood test and other tests to check for signs of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875937\"><span class=\"h1\">How is SJS/TEN treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment happens in the hospital and usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks. There you will see a team of different types of doctors, nurses, and other professionals. Some people with <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> are treated in the intensive care unit (&quot;ICU&quot;) or a burn center.</p><p>To treat <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN,</span> your treatment team will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop the medicine that caused <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> (if it was caused by a medicine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to keep your skin clean and as healthy as possible &ndash; This might involve gently removing dead skin, keeping it moist, adding dressings, or doing other things.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you strong medicines to help with pain in your skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you a feeding tube so you can get nutrition and fluids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check you for signs of infection &ndash; This is very important because people with <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> can develop serious infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you antibiotics to treat infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cyclosporine</a>, which might help slow down your symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possibly give you medicines to reduce inflammation, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875952\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after I have had SJS/TEN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN,</span> you must be very careful to <strong>never</strong> take the medicine that caused it again or closely related medicines. If you take the same medicine again or one that is closely related, it could kill you. You should wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace at all times that lists the medicine or medicines you must avoid and why. If you can't wear a bracelet or necklace, you should carry a document called an &quot;allergy passport&quot; at all times.</p><p>You should also learn all the names of the medicines you should avoid. Medicines often go by more than one name, so you might have to learn a few. For example, if a &quot;sulfa&quot; antibiotic caused <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN,</span> you also need to avoid closely related drugs like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sulfasalazine</a> (used to treat colitis or arthritis) and some antibiotic creams, lotions, and eye drops (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfacetamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sulfacetamide</a> drops and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">silver sulfadiazine</a> cream). Your doctor or nurse should give you a list of medicines you need to avoid taking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F97285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97285 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Make sure your pharmacy makes a note in your record that you had <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span>. Your pharmacy should also have a list of the medicines you must never take.</p><p>If you had <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> caused by a medicine, your doctor might suggest that your family members take a blood test to find out if they could be at risk of getting <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> with the same medicine. That way they can also be careful not to take medicines that can cause <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186875967\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
