People with urgency incontinence feel a strong need or &quot;urge&quot; to urinate all of a sudden. Often it is so strong that they can't make it to the bathroom in time. &quot;Overactive bladder&quot; is another term for having a sudden, frequent urge to urinate. People with overactive bladder might or might not actually leak urine.</p><p>Urgency incontinence is common, especially in women. But there are treatments that can help. There are also things you can do on your own to stop or reduce urine leakage so you don't have to &quot;just live with it.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827823063\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own for urgency incontinence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some steps that can help reduce urine leaks or urges:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on any foods or drinks that make your symptoms worse. Alcohol, caffeine, spicy or acidic foods, or artificial sweeteners make some people urinate more often or cause sudden urges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to drink too much right before bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent constipation &ndash; Constipation is a common problem that makes it hard to have bowel movements. It can make urgency incontinence worse.</p><p/><p>You can also try some things to help with bladder control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder retraining &ndash; Bladder retraining helps your bladder hold more urine so you can urinate less often. During bladder retraining, you go to the bathroom at scheduled times. For example, you might decide to go every hour. Then you make yourself go every hour, even if you don't think you need to. If you need to go sooner, try to wait until the whole hour has passed. After you get used to waiting 1 hour, you can try waiting longer between bathroom visits. Over time, you might be able to &quot;retrain&quot; your bladder to wait 3 or 4 hours between bathroom visits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation can help manage the urge to go. When you get an urge, stand still or sit down. Take a deep breath, squeeze your pelvic muscles, and let the &quot;wave&quot; of needing to go pass. Then walk slowly to the bathroom to urinate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic muscle exercises &ndash; Pelvic muscle exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine. These exercises can help, but people often do them wrong. Ask your doctor or nurse how to do them correctly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827823078\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors treat urgency incontinence in women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to bladder retraining, relaxation, and pelvic muscle exercises, treatment might include medicines and sometimes procedures. These are discussed in more detail below.</p><p><strong>Medicines to relax the bladder</strong> &ndash; These can help get symptoms under control. Medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">oxybutynin</a> (brand name: Ditropan), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolterodine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tolterodine</a> (brand name: Detrol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fesoterodine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fesoterodine</a> (brand name: Toviaz), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solifenacin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">solifenacin</a> (brand name: VESIcare), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darifenacin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">darifenacin</a> (brand name: Enablex), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirabegron-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mirabegron</a> (brand name: Mirbetriq). They come in pills you take by mouth and patches or gels you put on your skin.</p><p>Medicines for urgency incontinence can cause side effects, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very dry mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking and remembering things</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast heart rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleepiness</p><p/><p>If you are older, ask your doctor if it is safe to take these medicines. If you have any trouble thinking or remembering things, some of these medicines could make these issues worse.</p><p>If you take medicine to help with urgency incontinence or overactive bladder, you might need to try several different medicines before you find a treatment that works for you.</p><p><strong>Vaginal estrogen</strong> &ndash; If medicines that relax your bladder do not work for you or cause too many side effects, talk to your doctor about other treatments. For some women who have vaginal dryness after menopause, vaginal estrogen can help with this as well as your bladder problems.</p><p><strong>Procedures to help relax the bladder</strong> &ndash; If medicines don't help your symptoms or you can't take medicines, your doctor might suggest a procedure such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injection (shot) of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the bladder to help it relax &ndash; The injection needs to be given about once or twice a year. These injections can cause trouble urinating in about 1 out of 4 women who get them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with electrical nerve stimulation &ndash; This is done with a device that goes under the skin, like a pacemaker. Electrical stimulation sends mild electrical signals to nerves that affect the bladder. The signals do not hurt. This treatment can reduce sudden urges or the need to urinate often. You might need follow-up procedures after getting the device put in.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827823103\"><span class=\"h1\">How well do treatments for urgency incontinence in women work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on your symptoms and the cause of your urgency incontinence. For example, if you have another medical condition, such as diabetes, treating that condition might help.</p><p>Most women need to try several treatments and might use more than one at a time. For example, your doctor might suggest bladder retraining, medicine to relax your bladder, and vaginal estrogen. It can take a month or longer to know if a treatment is working. Try not to get discouraged if it feels like treatment is not working quickly enough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827823120\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with urgency incontinence need some kind of treatment for a long time, or for life. Treatment for urgency incontinence in women can help symptoms, but does not cure the cause of the incontinence.</p><p>Even if treatment doesn't stop urgency incontinence completely, it can make life easier and help you feel a lot better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827823137\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-to-treat-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-medicines-when-youre-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking medicines when you're older (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
