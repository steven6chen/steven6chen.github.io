This information may be helpful in determining the conditions associated with AF, the risk for recurrent AF following cardioversion, and the hemodynamic benefit of maintaining sinus rhythm.

A more selected subgroup may benefit from the additional information obtained from transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) evaluation for left atrial thrombi to allow for early cardioversion if no thrombi are identified. Comparison with a prior TTE (if available) may allow for assessment of the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling (transmitral Doppler A wave) when the patient is in sinus rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies from the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) investigators confirmed the usefulness of TEE for predicting thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This study involved 786 patients with nonrheumatic AF, 382 of whom were at high clinical risk for a thromboembolism (eg, women &gt;75 years of age and patients with systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or a history of previous thromboembolism, impaired left ventricular function, or recent congestive heart failure). The rate of stroke was increased over threefold when TEE evidence of dense spontaneous echo contrast was present, increased by threefold for reduced (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second)</span> left atrial appendage peak ejection velocity and for left atrial appendage thrombus, and increased by fourfold by complex aortic plaque.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTE provides detailed information about cardiac anatomy and function. In comparison, it is less useful for the detection of thrombus in the left atrium or left atrial appendage, which is better detected by TEE. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Left atrial thrombi'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Left atrial size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTE is particularly helpful in assessing left atrial size. The normal left atrial dimension in adults is less than 4.0 cm (or &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface area) or biplane derived left atrial volume index of less than 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface area. Left atrial enlargement is common in AF, particularly in patients with mitral valve disease, left ventricular cavity dilation, annular calcification, or hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, sustained AF itself can lead to a further increase in left atrial size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], an effect that is reversible after cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pulsed Doppler studies have shown that the time to recovery of atrial mechanical function is directly related to the duration of AF (eg, within 24 hours in patients with AF for &le;2 weeks and up to one month in those with AF for more than six weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the routine serial assessment of atrial mechanical function recovery is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-atria-and-appendages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the atria and appendages&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, left atrial enlargement is important prognostically. It decreases the probability that long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm will be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Patients with chronic (more than one year) AF, rheumatic mitral valve disease, and severe left atrial enlargement (dimension greater than 6.0 cm) are at greatest risk for recurrent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If, however, the duration of AF is brief, an attempt at cardioversion is reasonable for most patients regardless of absolute left atrial size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although TTE can provide anatomic imaging of the body of the left atrium, TEE is preferred when looking for left atrial thrombi and assessing left atrial appendage and right atrial appendage anatomy and function (abnormalities of which predispose to the thrombus formation), as these areas are not well seen on TTE. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Transesophageal echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitral valve function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTE is quite useful in the assessment of mitral valve function, which can influence the risk of thrombus formation. As an example, occult mitral stenosis in the adult may initially present with AF, often in the setting of acute thromboembolism. In this setting, long-term anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is indicated even if cardioversion to sinus rhythm is successful. Long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm is unlikely unless the mitral stenosis is corrected (by surgery or percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and investigational approaches to management of mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mitral regurgitation is commonly found among patients with AF. More than moderate mitral regurgitation appears to <strong>protect</strong> against clinical thromboembolism in chronic AF, presumably by minimized stasis in the left atrium and atrial appendage and less coagulation activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>). However, it does not appear to protect from the formation of left atrial appendage thrombus as identified on TEE.</p><p>Examination of a prior TTE when the patient is in sinus rhythm (if available) will also provide useful information on the relative atrial contribution to left ventricular filling by examining the transmitral peak A wave or peak E to A wave ratio. For those patients with a relatively <span class=\"nowrap\">high/large</span> transmitral A wave, the contribution of left atrial systole to left ventricular filling is greater. Thus, these patients may derive greater hemodynamic benefit from rhythm control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTE assessment of left ventricular systolic function helps to guide the choice of pharmacologic therapy for ventricular rate control in chronic AF.</p><p>A beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) is recommended for patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function, while patients with depressed left ventricular systolic function may be best treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>. Patients with overt heart failure due to systolic dysfunction are often treated with both a beta blocker to improve survival and digoxin to control symptoms, independent of the presence or absence of AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TTE can also detect left ventricular hypertrophy, focal wall motion abnormalities suggestive of myocardial infarction, and conditions less frequently associated with AF, including pericarditis (pericardial effusion), pulmonary embolus (dilated and poorly functioning right ventricle), and aortic stenosis (AF is generally poorly tolerated in this disorder and does not occur until very late in the disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p>Left ventricular dysfunction, as determined from the TTE, independently predicts an increased risk of a stroke in patients with AF. Analysis of 1066 patients entered into three prospective clinical trials evaluating the role of anticoagulation in nonvalvular AF (BAATAF, SPINAF, and SPAF) found that, among patients in the placebo or control groups, the incidence of a stroke was 9.3 percent per year in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction compared with 4.4 percent per year in those with normal or mildly abnormal left ventricular systolic function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70244 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The predictive value of left ventricular dysfunction for thromboembolic risk has been confirmed in many other studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;, section on 'Options for estimating risk in the individual patient'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preceding observations provide the rationale for the performance of TTE in all patients presenting with their first episode of AF. On the other hand, TEE should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnostic information will lead to alterations in therapy. It is a moderately invasive imaging technique that provides superior visualization of posterior structures, such as the left atrium and left atrial appendage.</p><p>TEE has particular value in estimating thromboembolic risk in different clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can detect left atrial thrombi for patients being considered for early cardioversion. In this setting, there is little additional benefit from TTE prior to TEE, as most of the necessary information can be derived from the TEE with its superior assessment of the appendages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients in paroxysmal or chronic AF, abnormalities in the left atrial appendage (thrombus, dense spontaneous echo contrast, or flow velocity &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/s)</span> or the presence of a complex aortic plaque increases the risk of a thromboembolic event and are more likely in patients with clinical risk factors for thromboembolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55452 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Left atrial thrombi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A main advantage of TEE is that it provides superior visualization of posterior structures, such as the left atrium and left atrial appendage as well as the anterior right atrial appendage. This is particularly important for the detection on thrombi at these sites.</p><p>The ability of TTE to identify or exclude left atrial or atrial appendage thrombi (as well as right atrial appendage thrombi) is quite limited, with a reported sensitivity of 39 to 63 percent, due largely to poor visualization of the left atrial appendage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. By contrast, TEE permits detection of thrombus in both the left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51472\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51472 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64234\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64234 \">movie 2</a>) and the left atrial appendage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56080\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56080 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66795\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66795 \">movie 4</a>).</p><p>TEE evidence of left atrial thrombi is seen in approximately 13 percent of patients presenting with nonrheumatic AF of more than three days duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The prevalence is increased in high-risk patients with mitral stenosis (33 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], left ventricular systolic dysfunction, enlargement of the left atrium or left atrial appendage, spontaneous echo contrast, a recent thromboembolic event (43 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and CHADS2 score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Recurrent embolization in the last setting may be due to migration of the residual thrombus. On the other hand, the apparent lack of atrial thrombi in 57 percent of these patients probably reflects migration of the entire thrombus during the embolic event, a thrombus not visualized by TEE due to its small size, or another source for the embolus.</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of TEE for left atrial thrombi (in patients in whom the left atrium was directly examined at surgery) are 93 to 100 percent and 99 to 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In a review of 231 patients in whom only 5.2 percent had a left atrial thrombus, TEE has a positive and negative predictive value of 86 and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For patients who are not candidates for TEE due to esophageal strictures or other contraindication, intracardiac echocardiography with the catheter in the main pulmonary artery has been shown to be at least as efficacious as TEE for identifying atrial appendage thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>One potential limitation of these studies is that they were performed by experienced operators and the accuracy may not be replicable at all institutions. Multiplane TEE imaging enables visualization of the body of the left atrium and left atrial appendage from multiple imaging planes, thereby providing superior assessment. It is the current standard approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The complementary role of three-dimension real-time TEE for atrial appendage thrombus is unknown. The use of an endocardial border definition echo contrast agent may help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Though no randomized data are available, we believe that cardioversion should <strong>not</strong> be attempted in patients with TEE evidence for atrial thrombi, even if thrombi appear &quot;adherent&quot; to the wall of the appendage. Such patients are typically given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy for at least four weeks before cardioversion as are patients who do not undergo TEE. Resolution of thrombi occurs in approximately 75 percent of patients with nonrheumatic AF with no formation of new thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, the time of resolution is more prolonged in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Though no randomized data are available, we believe that if cardioversion is desired, TEE should then be performed after prolonged anticoagulation to confirm thrombus resolution prior to cardioversion. In the setting of persistent thrombus, cardioversion associated thromboembolism has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>There does not appear to be a role for routine TEE prior to cardioversion in patients who have been adequately anticoagulated (INR 2 to 3) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or with one of the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants for at least four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>One setting in which the value of TEE is uncertain is in acute AF of less than 48 hours duration. Historically, these patients have been considered to be at low risk for clinical thromboembolism associated with cardioversion unless they have other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This hypothesis has been confirmed in more recent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of 375 consecutive patients with AF of less than 48 hours duration in whom screening TEE was not performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Conversion to sinus rhythm during the hospitalization occurred in 95 percent of patients; a clinical thromboembolic event occurred in three (0.8 percent), each of whom converted spontaneously. This overall rate of clinical thromboembolism is similar to what would have been expected with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy for one month prior to cardioversion. A retrospective study of 3143 patients with AF of less than 48 hours confirmed the very low rate of overall thromboembolism for this group (0.7 percent); however, the presence of both heart failure and diabetes identified a group with near 10 percent risk of clinical thromboembolism despite a duration of less than 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Finally, limited data suggest that the prevalence of left atrial thrombus on TEE is substantially lower when the duration of AF is less than 48 hours (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Based upon these observations, we do not routinely perform TEE or delay cardioversion for those with a history of nonvalvular AF of less than 48 hours, but we do initiate anticoagulation at presentation rather than waiting until 48 hours before initiation. For those patients with AF of less than 48 hours but coexisting rheumatic mitral valve disease, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or a history of thromboembolism, we initiate anticoagulation and perform TEE or delay cardioversion for four weeks. Patients with AF of less than 48 hours who have both diabetes and heart failure may be an increased thromboembolic risk, but further data are needed prior to recommending prolonged (one month therapeutic) anticoagulation or TEE prior to cardioversion in this patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous echo contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous echo contrast (SEC or &quot;smoke&quot;) refers to the presence of dynamic, smoke-like echoes seen during TEE in the left atrium or atrial appendage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51472\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51472 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66795\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66795 \">movie 4</a>). Although most widely studied in the left atrium, SEC also occurs in the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,37</a>].

Erythrocyte aggregation is mediated by plasma proteins, especially fibrinogen, which promotes red cell rouleaux formation by moderating the normal electrostatic forces (due to negatively charged membranes) which keep erythrocytes from aggregating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>SEC is a strong risk factor for and may be the preceding stage to thrombus formation and thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1,2,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,41,42</a>].

In comparison, low blood velocity was of limited predictive value.

Repeated transthoracic echocardiographic examinations for recurrent AF are not necessary unless the clinical presentation has changed.</p><p>The main advantage of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is its ability to detect left and right atrial appendage thrombi and patients at risk for thrombi because of the presence of spontaneous echo contrast or reduced left atrial appendage blood flow velocity. The main clinical use of TEE is in the management of early cardioversion in patients with AF of more than 48 hours or high-risk patients with AF of shorter duration who are candidates for cardioversion. Standard therapy in such patients consists of four weeks of therapeutic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy before cardioversion, which will cause resolution of most thrombi in patients with nonrheumatic AF with a low likelihood for formation of new thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. An alternative approach is TEE-guided therapy (without initial transthoracic echocardiography). Cardioversion can be performed with intravenous heparin or non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) if no thrombi are seen; this is followed by a month of warfarin or NOAC therapy to prevent new thrombus formation after cardioversion and for prophylaxis should AF recur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72971%7ECARD%2F54077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72971 graphicRef54077 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72676 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,50</a>]. On the other hand, cardioversion should be <strong>delayed</strong> if thrombi are seen in any cardiac chamber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and we believe that if cardioversion is desired, a repeat TEE should be performed to confirm thrombus resolution prior to cardioversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There does not appear to be a role for routine TEE prior to cardioversion in patients who have been adequately anticoagulated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or NOAC for at least four weeks prior to cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28,30,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,52,53</a>]. However, TEE immediately prior to elective cardioversion should be considered for those patients at increased risk for left atrial thrombi (eg, rheumatic mitral valve disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">recent/prior</span> thromboembolism, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Transesophageal echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with nonvalvular AF of less than 48 hours duration, the presence of heart failure and diabetes represent a group of patients at potentially high risk for clinical thromboembolism. As a result, prolonged (one month therapeutic) anticoagulation or short-term anticoagulation with screening TEE should be considered.
