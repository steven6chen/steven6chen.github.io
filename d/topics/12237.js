People with the disease can break their bones too easily. For instance, people with osteoporosis sometimes break a bone after falling down at home.</p><p>Breaking a bone can be serious, especially if the bone is in the hip. People who break a hip sometimes lose the ability to walk on their own. Many of them end up in a nursing home. That's why it is so important to avoid breaking a bone in the first place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483055785\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have osteoporosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis does not cause symptoms until you break a bone. But your doctor or nurse can have you tested for it. The best test is a bone density test called the &quot;DXA test.&quot; It is a special kind of X-ray.</p><p>Experts recommend bone density testing for women older than 65. That is because women in this age group have the highest risk of osteoporosis. Still, other people should sometimes be tested, too. Ask your doctor or nurse if you should be tested.</p><p>Some people learn that they have osteoporosis because they break a bone during a fall or a mild impact. This is called a &quot;fragility fracture,&quot; because people with healthy bones should not break a bone that easily. People who have fragility fractures are at high risk of having other bones break.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483055792\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep my bones as healthy as possible?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods with a lot of calcium, such as milk, yogurt, and green leafy vegetables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods with a lot of vitamin D, such as milk that has vitamin D added, and fish from the ocean</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take calcium and vitamin D pills (if you do not get enough from the food that you eat)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be active for at least 30 minutes, most days of the week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to 1 to 2 drinks a day at most</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483055799\"><span class=\"h1\">Do your best to keep from falling, too</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It sounds simple, but you can prevent a lot of fractures by reducing the chances of a fall. To do that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure all your rugs have a no-slip backing to keep them in place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuck away any electrical cords, so they are not in your way</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light all walkways well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch out for slippery floors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sturdy, comfortable shoes with rubber soles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your eyes checked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse to check whether any of your medicines might make you dizzy or increase your risk of falling</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483055806\"><span class=\"h1\">Can osteoporosis be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are a few medicines to treat osteoporosis. These medicines can reduce the chances that you will break a bone.</p><p>Doctors and nurses usually suggest trying medicines called bisphosphonates first. If those medicines do not do enough or if they cause side effects that you cannot stand, there are other medicines to try.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483055813\"><span class=\"h1\">How will I know the treatment is working?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors and nurses often order bone density tests to check if osteoporosis medicines are working. These are the same tests they use to find osteoporosis in the first place. Sometimes a blood or urine test is also needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483055820\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-compression-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertebral compression fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for osteoporosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Primary hyperparathyroidism (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
