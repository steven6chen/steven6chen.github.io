Coupled with the avoidance of breastfeeding and good access to comprehensive HIV and pregnancy care services, these regimens have significantly reduced perinatal transmission in resource-rich countries to one to two percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]; in the United States, it is estimated that only 69 HIV-infected infants were born in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite substantial barriers, efforts in resource-limited settings to introduce antiretroviral agents for perinatal prevention have also resulted in a marked decrease in perinatal HIV transmission (mother-to-child transmission [MTCT]) from over 570,000 in 2003 to an estimated 110,000 in 2015 within the 21 Global Plan priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>This topic will address the epidemiology of perinatal transmission and present the current antiretroviral recommendations for pregnant women and their infants for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) in resource-limited settings.

Sub-Saharan Africa carries the greatest burden of the epidemic: UNAIDS reported 150,000 pediatric infections worldwide in 2015; 110,000 new cases occurred in 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536114919\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of MTCT of HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Without antiretroviral preventive interventions, the risk of perinatal HIV transmission has varied between 15 and 45 percent, depending on maternal risk factors and whether breastfeeding is practiced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The most important risk factors for transmission have consistently been maternal plasma and breast milk viral load followed by maternal immunologic status and clinical stage, as suggested by observational studies and clinical trials in non-breastfed and breastfed populations. Analyses of viral load levels in the original trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> to prevent MTCT (PACTG 076) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as well as studies from Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], Uganda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and Kenya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], all demonstrate a direct positive correlation between maternal plasma viral load and risk of transmission to the infant. </p><p>This correlation is observed even among women taking antiretroviral agents. As an example, in a study from the United Kingdom and Ireland of over 10,000 HIV-infected pregnant women, MTCT rates were lower among women who had a viral load &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> near delivery compared with women who had higher viral loads (0.09 percent transmission versus 1.0 and 2.6 percent with viral load ranges 50-399 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and 400-999 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Other maternal and infant factors have also been associated with increased risk of transmission. Some associated maternal risk factors include low CD4 cell counts, anemia, more advanced WHO clinical disease stage, maternal mastitis, and acute maternal seroconversion during pregnancy or breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. As an example, in a meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included over 20,000 person-years of follow-up, the pooled incidence of HIV acquisition during pregnancy or postpartum was 2.9 events per 100 person years, and the pooled risk of MTCT among such women was 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23154845\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of HIV transmission from mothers to their infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Greater than 90 percent of all new pediatric HIV cases result from perinatal transmission of HIV, which can occur during pregnancy (in utero), at <span class=\"nowrap\">labor/delivery</span> (intrapartum), or post-delivery (postnatal) through breastfeeding.</p><p>In non-breastfeeding settings prior to the availability of antiretroviral interventions,<em> </em>in utero infections (indicated by a positive HIV nucleic acid amplification test [NAT] in the infant within 72 hours after birth) accounted for about one-third of the infant HIV infections, while about two-thirds of transmissions occurred around the time of labor and delivery (indicated by HIV NAT results in the infant that were negative within the first 72 hours after birth, but then positive by four to six weeks of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>In breastfeeding settings prior to the availability of antiretroviral interventions, about 25 to 40 percent of infant infections were estimated to occur in utero, about 50 percent around the time of <span class=\"nowrap\">labor/delivery</span> or through very early breastfeeding, and the remainder during the breastfeeding period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23154852\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of transmission</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23154860\"><span class=\"h3\">In utero</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A majority of in<em> </em>utero transmission is thought to occur during the third trimester. This conclusion is based on low rates of viral detection using HIV NAT on fetal tissue from abortions in the first and second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] as well as statistical modeling analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study of long versus short antenatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the rate of in utero transmission was 5.1 percent when starting zidovudine at 36 weeks gestation compared with 1.6 percent when starting zidovudine at 28 weeks gestation, suggesting that a significant proportion of transmission may occur between 28 to 36 weeks gestation, and a smaller residual amount of in utero infection may occur earlier in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Mechanisms of transmission are thought to be related to breakdown of the integrity of the placenta, leading to microtransfusions of viremic maternal blood across the placenta to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In addition, microtransfusions across the placenta during labor contractions also likely contribute to the heightened risk of transmission during the labor and delivery period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536115135\"><span class=\"h3\">During breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of transmission of HIV during breastfeeding is discussed elsewhere.

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised its guidelines to recommend initiation of lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected individuals regardless of CD4 cell count, including pregnant and breastfeeding women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, ART should be initiated as early as possible in all HIV-infected pregnant women and continued lifelong. In addition, all infants born to HIV-infected mothers should receive post-exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis. The recommended first-line ART regimen in pregnant and breastfeeding women is the same as recommended in non-pregnant adults: tenofovir plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> administered as a fixed dose, once-daily combination regimen. </p><p>This section discusses the WHO guidelines for antiretroviral management of pregnant women and their infants in resource-limited settings in further detail.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472064769\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal antiretroviral use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ART is recommended for all HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women in resource-limited settings, regardless of their CD4 cell count or disease stage, to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants and for their own clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The goal of ART is to reduce the viral load to undetectable levels; with regards to prevention, the risk of transmission of HIV decreases with the viral load. (See <a href=\"#H536114919\" class=\"local\">'Risk of MTCT of HIV'</a> above.)</p><p>Women already taking ART should continue it. For other women, a lifelong ART regimen should be initiated as soon as HIV is diagnosed. Details of the regimen and its duration are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H472064781\" class=\"local\">'Regimen selection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H472064787\" class=\"local\">'Duration of antiretroviral use'</a> below.)</p><p>The recommendation for initiation of a regimen as early in pregnancy as possible is supported by results from observational studies that suggest that earlier initiation of ART is associated with lower rates of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. As an example, in a study of 1142 HIV-infected pregnant women in South Africa, lower rates of transmission were observed among women who had initiated ART prior to pregnancy compared with during pregnancy (0.7 versus 5.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Early initiation of ART with sustained viral suppression provides maximal protection against transmission; in the French Perinatal Cohort, there were no perinatal transmissions among 2651 HIV-infected pregnant women who initiated ART before conception, continued it throughout pregnancy, and had viral load &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472064781\"><span class=\"h3\">Regimen selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WHO guidelines recommend initiation of a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> in all HIV-infected pregnant or breastfeeding women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>]. </p><p>Tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> is also the same preferred first-line regimen for non-pregnant adults and thus allows for streamlining ART administration to all adults in resource-limited settings. Additional advantages of the regimen include antiviral potency, relatively low frequency of severe adverse effects, a greater likelihood of adherence with a once-daily dosing, affordability, and efficacy against hepatitis B virus. In a trial of pregnant women in Uganda, initiation of an efavirenz-containing ART regimen at 12 to 28 weeks gestation resulted in virologic suppression in 98 percent by delivery and 91 percent at 48 weeks postpartum; no perinatal HIV transmissions were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that only 48 percent (716,500 of 1,490,000) of HIV-infected pregnant women in resource limited settings received the most effective antiretroviral regimens for the prevention of MTCT as recommended by the WHO at the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Progress, however, is being made. The Joint United Nations Program on <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> (UNAIDS) reported that coverage of antiretroviral programs for prevention of MTCT increased from 36 percent in 2009 to 80 percent in 2015 among their 21 priority countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23155067\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstacles along the prevention cascade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For PMTCT services to be effective, interventions must achieve high uptake in all aspects of PMTCT care, from antenatal services to postpartum linkage to HIV care. Real world challenges to the uptake of PMTCT services can occur at multiple points along the care cascade of antenatal, <span class=\"nowrap\">labor/delivery,</span> and postpartum services. (See <a href=\"#H472065053\" class=\"local\">'Overview of care to prevent transmission'</a> above.)</p><p>Obstacles at the district health centers in many resource-limited settings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low uptake of antenatal care: pregnant women not accessing antenatal services at all, or only coming for one antenatal visit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited availability and scale-up of PMTCT services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deliveries occurring unassisted at home, or with private midwives or traditional birth assistants and not at health care facilities </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High rates of loss to follow-up attributed to individual, structural, and community factors </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine lack of commodities, including HIV test kits, antiretroviral agents, laboratory reagents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate health care worker staffing in maternal and child health (MCH) clinics and delivery settings </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited numbers of health workers qualified to prescribe antiretroviral agents </p><p/><p>Several evaluations have been undertaken to analyze the real world effectiveness of PMTCT programs in resource-limited settings. These have revealed substantial challenges to providing optimal PMTCT services. In a review of PMTCT programs in 21 resource limited countries sub-Saharan Africa and India that receive President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funding, there was reduced uptake of effective interventions at all points of the PMTCT cascade in a number of resource-limited settings, including Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, and Uganda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This resulted in suboptimal antiretroviral delivery: less than half of HIV-infected mothers and less than one-third of HIV-exposed infants received appropriate antiretroviral interventions. Similarly, the PEARL study evaluated the uptake of PMTCT services in selected community facilities in South Africa, Cameroon, Zambia, and Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. It also included measurement of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> in cord blood. Overall, there were major gaps in all points in the cascade in the delivery of PMTCT services, including failure to test some women and failure to provide antiretroviral interventions, including single dose nevirapine, to mothers or infants. Only 50 percent of mother-infant pairs received both infant and maternal prophylaxis. In addition, a substantial portion of women were lost to follow-up antenatally or failed to come to health centers for delivery. </p><p>In contrast, South Africa has established a program to evaluate the effectiveness of their national PMTCT strategies. In a facility-based survey of 580 health care facilities in nine provinces conducted from August 2011 to March 2012 and again from October 2012 to May 2013, 10,106 and 9120 caregiver-infant pairs, respectively, were enrolled at the four- to eight-week infant immunization visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Among the infants, 32.3 percent were exposed to HIV in 2011 to 2012 and 33.1 percent in 2012 to 2013. The national MTCT rate at four to eight weeks was 2.7 percent in 2011 to 2012 and 2.6 percent in 2012 to 2013. HIV-infected women who received antiretroviral drugs had significantly lower early MTCT than those who did not receive antiretroviral drugs (2.0 versus 10.2 percent, respectively). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23155074\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal testing issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of infected pregnant women is critical to control of perinatal transmission. The use of routine or &quot;opt-out&quot; HIV rapid testing strategy has proven highly effective when implemented. This approach informs all pregnant women that they will be tested for HIV unless they specifically decline. The opt-out approach has consistently resulted in &gt;95 percent uptake of rapid same day HIV antibody testing across a variety of international settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23155081\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal adherence and loss to follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate antiretroviral adherence and follow-up during pregnancy and particularly in the postpartum setting are major obstacles for PMTCT programs.

A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies evaluating adherence among HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women in high and low resource settings suggested that antiretroviral adherence was somewhat better during the antepartum period (70.5 percent, 95% CI 58.3-81.2) compared to the postpartum period (70 versus 52 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].
