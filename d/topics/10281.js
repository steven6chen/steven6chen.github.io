This is probably an underestimate because unrecognized, mild, or atypical reactions occur due to variable penetrance of the inherited trait. Approximately half of patients who develop acute MH have one or two uneventful exposures to triggering agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87579301\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MH occurs in all ethnic groups in all parts of the world. Reactions occur more frequently in males than females (2:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. Children under 19 years account for 45 to 52 percent of reported events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H647215659\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) patients have genetic skeletal muscle receptor abnormalities, allowing excessive calcium accumulation in the presence of certain anesthetic triggering agents. Very little is known about the specific mechanisms by which anesthetics interact with these abnormal receptors to trigger an MH crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/4,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10</a>]. During an episode of MH, the clinical manifestations are due to cellular hypermetabolism, leading to sustained muscular contraction and breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), anaerobic metabolism, acidosis, and their sequelae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H647215666\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal muscle physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depolarization spreads throughout the muscle cell via the transverse tubule system, which activates dihydropyridine (DHP) receptors located within the t-tubule membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58185 \">figure 1</a>). These receptors are coupled to ryanodine receptors (RYR1), which are calcium channels embedded in the wall of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium release through the DHP receptor triggers the RYR1 receptors to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Calcium combines with troponin to cross-link actin and myosin, resulting in muscle cell contraction. Reuptake of calcium by the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) leads to muscle cell relaxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H647215673\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant hyperthermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of MHS patients have mutations encoding for abnormal RYR1 or DHP receptors; exposure to triggering agents in these patients may lead to unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space, leading to an acute MH crisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58185 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/11-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-20</a>]. The accumulation of myoplasmic calcium causes sustained muscle contraction.</p><p>Accelerated levels of aerobic metabolism sustain the muscle for a time, but produce carbon dioxide and cellular acidosis, and deplete oxygen and adenosine triphosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. This causes the early signs of MH: hypercarbia and mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">respiratory/metabolic</span> acidosis. A change to anaerobic metabolism worsens acidosis with the production of lactate. Once energy stores are depleted, rhabdomyolysis occurs and results in hyperkalemia and myoglobinuria. Hyperkalemia from rhabdomyolysis may occur early in muscular patients.</p><p>Over time, sustained contraction generates more heat than the body is able to dissipate. Marked hyperthermia occurs minutes to hours following the initial onset of symptoms. In some cases, core body temperature may rise 1&ordm;C every few minutes. Severe hyperthermia (up to 45&ordm;C [113&ordm;F]) leads to a marked increase in carbon dioxide production, and increased oxygen consumption can cause widespread vital organ dysfunction. Severe hyperthermia is associated with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, a poor prognostic indicator and often terminal event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism whereby certain anesthetic agents trigger these events in MHS patients is unclear. Prolonged RYR1 channel opening has been demonstrated in an experimental model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Volatile anesthetics potentiate sarcoplasmic calcium release in patients with MHS. Halothane, for example, increases the fluidity of the lipid membrane, activating SERCA, limiting reuptake of calcium from the cytosol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a> is an analog of acetylcholine and stimulates the motor endplate to initiate muscle depolarization, which can become sustained in MHS patients.</p><p>The only known therapy for MH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a>, binds to the RYR1 receptor to inhibit the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; this reverses the negative cascade of effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIGGERING AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of cases of malignant hyperthermia (MH) have occurred while the patient was receiving a volatile anesthetic agent (eg, halothane, enflurane, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>) with or without administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>MH has been reported following administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> in the absence of an inhalational agent (eg, to facilitate endotracheal intubation). The majority of such cases come from a series of 129 patients who were biopsy-proven MH-susceptible (MHS); 20 of whom manifested their signs of MH with succinylcholine alone (without coadministration of a volatile agent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Acute MH has also been reported in MHS patients exposed to heat stress or vigorous exercise.

In addition, there are several reports of children that developed spontaneous fatal MH under normal living conditions. Postmortem, these children demonstrated abnormal ryanodine receptor mutations that likely conferred MHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>MHS patients may not consistently develop the acute syndrome with every anesthetic exposure. While an acute MH crisis may develop at first exposure to a triggering agent, the average patient has had previous exposures prior to having a documented reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of malignant hyperthermia (MH) vary, but early presentation typically includes hypercarbia, sinus tachycardia, or masseter or generalized muscle rigidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33</a>]. The most common initial sign of an MH crisis is an unexpected rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>), which is difficult to decrease as minute ventilation is increased. Generalized muscle rigidity in the presence of neuromuscular blockade is virtually pathognomonic for MH when other signs are present.</p><p>Most patients do not develop all the signs of MH; however, those that occur typically present in a similar order (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88902 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The clinical signs present perioperatively in several possible patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately following anesthetic induction, manifested by masseter muscle rigidity (MMR) (in the presence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volatile agents).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperatively during any phase of the anesthetic, manifested by gradually worsening hypercarbia, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and sometimes generalized rigidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the cessation of the anesthetic agent, but usually within minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperatively, with isolated rhabdomyolysis in otherwise asymptomatic patients.

Hyperthermia is generally a later sign of MH and is typically absent when the diagnosis is initially suspected; in a large series of 255 patients, rapidly-increasing or inappropriately-elevated temperature was one of the first signs in only 8.2 percent of MH crises, and was the sole initial sign in only 3.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4213755\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Early signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early signs of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88906\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88906 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercarbia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Masseter muscle rigidity (MMR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized muscle rigidity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypercarbia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most reliable initial clinical sign heralding the development of acute MH is hypercarbia resistant to increasing the patient's minute ventilation.

Generalized rigidity would not be seen in sepsis. Other perioperative causes of fever are much more common than acute MH. Patients undergoing surgery involving endothelial surfaces (gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, etc) are particularly prone to develop fever, which can be due to transient bacteremia or the effects of anesthetics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pheochromocytoma </strong>&ndash; Undiagnosed pheochromocytoma may present during surgery with episodic severe hypertension and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Symptoms which overlap with MH include tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, and hyperthermia to 104 to 106&deg;F. Hypotension and cardiovascular collapse may develop. Muscular signs (generalized rigidity, masseter spasm, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperkalemia) would not be present with thyroid storm.

The diagnosis is further supported by muscle rigidity (generalized or prolonged masseter muscle rigidity [MMR]) or an otherwise unexplained metabolic acidosis. When these clinical signs occur without a persuasive alternative diagnosis, treatment of presumed MH must be initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68918 \">table 6</a>).

Mortality from MH has declined significantly with the routine use of end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring and availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a> and is reported to be between 1 and 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>However, the exact mortality rate is unknown because of the paucity of accurate data on the number of actual MH cases and the number of deaths reported to the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS). On average, MHAUS receives notice of approximately 100 cases of MH per year, and reports of one or two MH related deaths every one to two years. Thus a rough estimate of mortality is 0.5 percent. </p><p>Of note, an analysis of MH reports submitted to MHAUS between 1987 and 2006 found that the risk of dying with an MH episode correlated with the use and type of temperature monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Patients whose temperature was not monitored were at least twice as likely to die as those who had core temperature monitoring. Skin temperature monitoring was not as effective as core temperature monitoring. In theory, continuous core temperature monitoring allowed more rapid diagnosis of an MH event, more rapid treatment, and reductions in peak temperature and duration of hyperthermia. All deaths occurred in patients with a peak temperature of 38.9&ordm;C or higher.</p><p>Other factors that increase risk for cardiac arrest and death with MH include advanced age, comorbidities, heavy muscular build (eg, young males), and the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING AFTER ACUTE MH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following recovery from an acute malignant hyperthermia (MH) event, we counsel patients that, until definitive testing for MH susceptibility (MHS) is complete, they should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have anesthesia with triggering agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid exercise in excessive heat or humidity, as this may trigger an event</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inform family members of the possible MH episode, as MHS is a genetic condition and family members may also need to be evaluated</p><p/><p>MHS patients are encouraged to learn as much as possible about the nature of their condition and should be directed to the appropriate educational resources.

Unrecognized, mild, or atypical reactions likely occur due to variable penetrance of the autosomal dominant inherited trait. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Triggering agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MH-susceptible (MHS) individuals have skeletal muscle receptor abnormalities, most often in ryanodine receptors (RYR1), which allow excessive intracellular calcium to accumulate in response to triggering agents. This triggers intracellular events leading to skeletal muscle hypermetabolism. (See <a href=\"#H647215659\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the initial clinical signs of MH typically occur within one hour of anesthesia induction, the onset of MH can occur any time during the administration of triggering agents. The onset of MH in the postoperative period is extremely rare and does not generally manifest solely as temperature elevation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest continuous core temperature monitoring during anesthetics lasting more than 30 minutes.

Other prominent early clinical signs include sinus tachycardia and muscle rigidity. Hyperthermia is a later sign of MH, and can be absent when the diagnosis is initially suspected. (See <a href=\"#H4213755\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical factors that would account for hypercapnia should be excluded; this includes decreased carbon dioxide elimination (eg, inadequate ventilation, rebreathing exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>) or increased production (eg, absorption of laparoscopic CO<sub>2</sub>). Other medical causes of these clinical signs are numerous and more common than MH. However, unless the clinician is persuaded that an alternative diagnosis is responsible, consideration of the differential diagnoses should not interfere with a presumptive diagnosis of MH and initiation of the acute MH management protocol.
