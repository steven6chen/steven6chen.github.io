A majority of patients will experience some level of fatigue during their course of treatment, and approximately one-third will have persistent fatigue for a number of years posttreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Cancer-related fatigue profoundly affects quality of life (QOL) of both patients and their families, including physical, psychosocial, and <span class=\"nowrap\">economic/occupational</span> aspects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Furthermore, fatigue is routinely identified by patients as one of the most distressing symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment, yet fatigue has been consistently underreported and overlooked as a potentially remediable cause of treatment-related morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. More recently, screening for and treatment of cancer-related fatigue during therapy and during the period of cancer survivorship has become a major focus of supportive care in oncology and is the subject of guidelines from several expert groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2802\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Here we will review the contributory factors and pathogenesis of cancer-related fatigue, and screening for as well as clinical assessment of patients with cancer-related fatigue. Treatment of cancer-related fatigue and issues surrounding fatigue that are specific to palliative care patients are discussed elsewhere.

Cancer-related fatigue differs from the fatigue that accompanies everyday life, which is usually temporary and relieved by rest.</p><p>The term asthenia has been proposed to describe the condition of chronic pathologic tiredness in patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the term fatigue has gained widespread acceptance in the medical literature and is preferentially used in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity grading scale that covers fatigue, asthenia, and malaise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60072 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Specific diagnostic criteria have been proposed for defining cancer-related fatigue as an independent entity in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. At least 6 of 11 criteria must be met to make the diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61574 \">table 2</a>). In studies of diverse patient populations, approximately 10 to 26 percent of subjects are diagnosed as having cancer-related fatigue using this definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>The use of diagnostic criteria such as these provides a greater degree of specificity than the simple question &ldquo;Do you feel tired?&rdquo; as was used in two national cancer-related fatigue prevalence studies and that resulted in spuriously high prevalence figures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and time course'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the formal diagnostic criteria as outlined in the ICD-10 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61574 \">table 2</a>) are not in widespread use, and patients do not necessarily need to have a minimum number of criteria to receive a clinical diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue. Their use is not recommended in guidelines for screening and assessment of cancer-related fatigue from expert groups, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#supportive&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWX256ZqT4TPl7754UoXDZVl2F+5F2bPeNX6VEfQ3uoKfaYPtqdJJujaaysmOOkv5++2qDuUboSXI+OKZzY/XKlPI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2802\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND TIME COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer-related fatigue is a common problem. A majority of patients will experience some level of fatigue during their course of treatment, and approximately one-third will have persistent fatigue for a number of years posttreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The true incidence of cancer-related fatigue in cancer patients is difficult to ascertain; published studies are restricted to prevalence data. Estimates are that cancer-related fatigue affects between 15 and 90 percent of cancer patients overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/12,16-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16-31</a>] and more than 75 percent of those with advanced cancer or bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/18,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32</a>]. The wide range of these estimates likely reflects variable diagnostic criteria used to define cancer-related fatigue.</p><p>The prevalence and severity of cancer-related fatigue were studied in two United States national surveys commissioned by the Fatigue Coalition, a multidisciplinary group of practitioners, researchers, and patient advocates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first survey, 419 cancer patients who were members of 1700 randomly selected American families were interviewed by telephone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Fatigue was defined as a positive response to the single question &ldquo;Do you feel tired?&rdquo; The majority had solid tumors, and treatment consisted of chemotherapy (59 percent), radiation therapy ([RT] 63 percent), or both (24 percent). More than one-half had received therapy within the last year. In a separate mail survey, 197 of 600 randomly sampled oncologists responded to a questionnaire assessing perceptions and attitudes concerning cancer-related fatigue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Overall, 74 percent of patients reported fatigue at some point during the course of their illness, with 32 percent reporting daily fatigue. However, only 50 percent of patients had discussed fatigue with their clinician, and in only one-fourth of cases was any intervention proposed. Patients and oncologists disagreed on the importance of cancer-related fatigue. Although doctors believed that pain affected patients to a greater degree than fatigue, patients thought that cancer-related fatigue adversely affected their daily lives to a greater degree than pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were noted in a second telephone survey of 379 patients who had received chemotherapy with or without RT for some form of malignancy, identified from a representative sample of 6125 families obtained from the US Bureau of the Census [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Fatigue, defined the same way as in the first study, was present on at least some days of the month during chemotherapy in 76 percent of patients, with 30 percent suffering from fatigue on a daily basis. Patients reported fatigue as the symptom that most affected quality of life (QOL), followed by nausea, depression, and pain. The economic impact of cancer-related fatigue was considerable. Of the 177 employed patients, 75 percent changed their employment status as a result of fatigue, and 65 percent reported that their caregivers had to take at least one day (mean 4.5 days) off from work in a typical month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparable findings also were noted in a survey of patients and health care practitioners conducted by the All-Ireland Fatigue Coalition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, all of these surveys consist of retrospective cross-sectional data and are biased by recall and the use of nonvalidated diagnostic criteria.</p><p/><p>As expected, a lower prevalence of cancer-related fatigue has been found in studies applying stricter diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/12,13,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,34</a>]. This was illustrated in a validation study of the cancer-related fatigue diagnostic criteria being proposed for use in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61574 \">table 2</a>) that was carried out in 379 individuals receiving chemotherapy with or without RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Overall, 141 patients (37 percent) had fatigue for at least two weeks in the prior month (ie, one of the proposed criteria), although only 66 (17 percent) met the proposed definition of cancer-related fatigue.</p><p>An additional problem with prevalence data is that cancer-related fatigue tends to fluctuate over the course of cancer treatment. For patients receiving chemotherapy, cancer-related fatigue is commonly cyclic and worst when blood counts are at their nadir (usually 10 to 14 days following treatment initiation). In contrast, the intensity of cancer-related fatigue in patients undergoing RT typically peaks toward the end of therapy, gradually decreasing thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/28,35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,35-41</a>].</p><p>Although cancer-related fatigue is most prevalent during active cancer therapy, a sense of fatigue may persist in survivors for months or even years after cessation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,2,30,39,42-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,30,39,42-52</a>]. The available data suggest that up to one-third of cancer survivors will have persistent posttreatment fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A small minority of patients who are presumably cured of their cancer are so debilitated by fatigue that they are still unable to work or regain their premorbid lifestyles years after completing treatment. Because of the lack of objective findings, many have problems maintaining disability status, causing additional stress and anxiety for themselves and their families.</p><p>Given the persistence of fatigue following completion of active cancer therapy, guidelines from expert groups including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2802\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>) recommend screening for fatigue at the end of primary therapy and as clinically indicated (at least annually) during the period of survivorship care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].
