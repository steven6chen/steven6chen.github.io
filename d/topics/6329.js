The epididymis is a small structure that sits on top of the testicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>). The epididymis stores sperm and moves it along the male reproductive tract.</p><p>Different infections and conditions can cause epididymitis. In teens and men who are having sex, epididymitis is commonly caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea. These are 2 different infections that people can catch during sex.</p><p>Epididymitis can also be caused by other conditions or infections that people don't catch during sex. These things are more likely to cause epididymitis in older men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144095\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of epididymitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epididymitis causes pain in the testicles or scrotum. The scrotum is the skin sac around the testicles.</p><p>Besides pain, epididymitis can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the scrotum or testicles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness of the scrotum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144110\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor or nurse if you have pain or swelling in your testicles or scrotum.</p><p>If your pain is severe, and your doctor or nurse can't see you right away, you should go to the emergency room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144125\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for epididymitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also probably do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound of your scrotum &ndash; An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests &ndash; If you have discharge from your urethra (the opening in your penis where urine leaves your body), your doctor or nurse will take a sample of the discharge. He or she will send the sample to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144140\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help with the pain and swelling, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the area every few hours, for 15 minutes each time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a jock strap to support your scrotum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take an over-the-counter medicine to treat your pain. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144155\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatment might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treatment depends on what's causing your epididymitis.</p><p>If a bacterial infection is causing your epididymitis, your doctor will prescribe antibiotic medicines. Most men can take antibiotic pills at home, but men with a severe infection might need treatment in the hospital.</p><p>If you are treated for chlamydia or gonorrhea, you should tell the person you last had sex with, and anyone you have had sex with in the past 2 to 3 months. They might also be infected (even if they have no symptoms) and need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144170\"><span class=\"h1\">Can epididymitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help prevent epididymitis that is caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom every time you have sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding sex when you or your partner has genital itching, discharge, or other symptoms that could be caused by an infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21144185\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=teen-sexuality-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Teen sexuality (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adolescent sexuality (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
