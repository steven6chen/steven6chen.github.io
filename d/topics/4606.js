Abnormalities in any one or more of the above steps can result in hyperbilirubinemia in which there is either an elevation in unconjugated bilirubin alone or of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. Complex clinical disorders, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, can affect multiple processes, resulting in the accumulation of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. In these settings, the proportion of conjugated bilirubin in plasma increases. In contrast, the unconjugated fraction alone is increased with bilirubin overproduction (as with hemolysis) without liver disease and with inherited or acquired disorders that specifically affect bilirubin uptake or glucuronidation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are bilirubin overproduction, Gilbert syndrome, and neonatal jaundice.

It has been divided into two distinct forms (types I and II) based upon the severity of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I disease is associated with severe jaundice and neurologic impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy that can result in permanent neurologic sequelae (kernicterus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II disease is associated with a lower serum bilirubin concentration and affected patients survive into adulthood without neurologic impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE I DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I was described by Crigler and Najjar in 1952 in six infants in three families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All six infants developed severe, permanent, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia within the first few days of life, without any evidence of hemolysis. Five of the six infants died of kernicterus by the age of 15 months. The sixth infant was free of neurologic disease until 15 years of age, when kernicterus suddenly developed; the adolescent died six months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The syndrome occurs in all races and has been associated with consanguinity in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotype of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I can be caused by a variety of alterations in the coding sequences of the bilirubin-uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene which is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73505 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bilirubin-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bilirubin metabolism&quot;</a>). These mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein, resulting in complete loss or very low levels of hepatic bilirubin-UGT (UGT1A1) activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This is in contrast to the defect in Gilbert syndrome in which the defect is in the promoter region, rather than the gene itself; as a result, reduced amounts of the normal protein are produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gilbert syndrome and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to bilirubin overproduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The UGT gene exists in numerous isoforms of which UGT1A1 (bilirubin-UGT1) is the only one that contributes significantly to bilirubin conjugation in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Deletions, insertions, missense mutations, or premature stop codons within the UGT1A1 gene can be located in any of the five exons comprising the UGT1A1 mRNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73505 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Genetic alterations located in exon 1 affect the activity of only bilirubin-UGT isoform (UGT1A1); in contrast, mutations involving exons 2 to 5 affect all isoforms expressed from the UGT1A locus.</p><p>Because of the high frequency of the Gilbert-type promoter in the general population (51 percent of the Western population has at least one Gilbert type allele), some heterozygous carriers of mutations that cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome also carry the Gilbert-type promoter on their normal allele. Such combined defects can lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia, since the activity of the normal allele is reduced to about 30 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This explains the frequent finding of intermediate levels of hyperbilirubinemia in the family members of patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome, both types I and II.</p><p>An animal model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome, the Gunn rat, was first described in 1938 and has provided an ideal model for the study of bilirubin metabolism and of therapeutic agents for this disease. The Gunn rat develops a nonhemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait; heterozygotes are anicteric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The disease is caused by the deletion of a single guanosine residue in the common region exon 4. The serum bilirubin is all unconjugated; as a result there is no bilirubinuria or conjugated bilirubin in bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The liver histology is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I should be suspected in infants who develop persistent jaundice due to indirect reacting (unconjugated) bilirubin within the first few days after birth. These children have an otherwise normal liver function test profile and may have neurologic symptoms due to kernicterus. Occasional patients have late onset kernicterus in adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>].

Stool color is normal, but fecal urobilinogen excretion is diminished due to the marked reduction in the conjugation of bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/1-3,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,18-22</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bilirubin-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bilirubin metabolism&quot;</a>). The rate of bilirubin production, bone marrow morphology, and red cell morphology and survival are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Histopathologic findings are nonspecific on light and electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although other disorders can cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in newborns, they can be distinguished based upon the level of hyperbilirubinemia and its duration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolytic disorders alone do not raise serum bilirubin concentrations beyond 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic jaundice (a common transient elevation in serum bilirubin in newborns that is more common in East Asians) usually resolves within the first 10 days of life. Serum bilirubin concentrations are usually less than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in full-term neonates, and 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in premature neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is possible that mutations in the structural region of the UGT1A1 gene account for jaundice in some of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast milk jaundice (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in breast-fed newborns) is similar to neonatal jaundice except that serum bilirubin levels are higher (up to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> if untreated) and persist for a longer duration.

As a general rule, type II is associated with lower serum bilirubin concentrations although values can overlap with type I, especially when there is underlying hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>). As a result, the differential diagnosis of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I includes Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, with or without coexisting hemolysis.</p><p>The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> can help to differentiate between these disorders. The serum bilirubin concentration can be reduced by the administration of phenobarbital (60 to 120 mg for 14 days) in most patients with type II but not type I disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Another difference between patients with type I and II disease is the presence of bilirubin glucuronides in bile. Conjugated bilirubin is absent or present only in trace amounts in patients with type I who have little or no UGT1A1 activity, while a significant amount of conjugated bilirubin is detectable in the bile of patients with type II (although the proportion of monoconjugates is greatly increased) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>). Thus, chromatographic analysis of bile collected from the duodenum through an orally placed duodenal catheter or an upper gastrointestinal endoscope can be used to differentiate the two forms of the syndrome.</p><p>DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, buccal scrapings, or any other tissue can be used to make a genetic diagnosis in both affected patients and heterozygous carriers. Furthermore, we have found that genetic analysis of chorionic villus samples or amniotic cells permits prenatal identification of the Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the introduction of phototherapy and plasmapheresis to lower the serum bilirubin concentration, almost all patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I died during the first 18 months of life due to kernicterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]. Most patients treated with these methods survive past puberty without significant brain damage but subsequently succumb to kernicterus later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/18,20,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,31,32</a>]. One of the reasons for treatment failure is thickening of the skin, which renders phototherapy less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 who had not been on phototherapy did not have any reduction of serum bilirubin, suggesting that calcium acts by binding photoproducts of bilirubin that are excreted in bile and would have been reabsorbed in the absence of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Orlistat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study in Gunn rats suggested that combined oral treatment with calcium phosphate plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a> was more effective in reducing serum unconjugated bilirubin than phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, decreases bilirubin in proportion to the amount of fat excreted in feces supporting the concept that it &quot;captures&quot; intestinal unconjugated bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A subsequent placebo-controlled crossover trial in humans included 16 patients (seven with type I and nine with type II disease) who were randomly assigned to their usual treatment (phototherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

As a result, clinical trials in humans are being planned.</p><p>Introduction of a normal bilirubin-UGT gene can be accomplished by several methods including autologous transplantation of cells that have been transduced with the normal gene ex vivo, and introduction of the gene into the liver by in situ perfusion or by systemic administration of vectors that are capable of carrying the gene to the liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Ex vivo gene transduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ex vivo gene transduction begins with the harvesting of hepatocytes by partial hepatectomy, which are then grown in primary culture.

Because the cells are autologous, rejection is not a problem and immunosuppression is not required.</p><p>This approach with the LDL receptor gene has, in an initial report, produced a modest reduction in LDL-cholesterol in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-drug-resistant-hypercholesterolemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of drug-resistant hypercholesterolemia&quot;</a>.) The main shortcoming of this method is that the number of hepatocytes that can be harvested and transduced is limited; furthermore, the surgical resection that is required to harvest the cells is not readily repeatable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Vector-mediated gene delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research is underway to develop methods to introduce the normal bilirubin-UGT gene into the liver of Gunn rats using viral and nonviral vectors. Repeated intravenous injection of naked plasmids expressing UGT1A1 delivered the plasmid DNA to muscle cells and reduced serum bilirubin levels in Gunn rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, the majority of the ongoing studies are based upon the use of recombinant viral vectors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenoviral vectors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenoviral vectors efficiently deliver the transgene and have the additional advantage of specifically localizing in liver after systemic administration. In contrast to the murine leukemia virus, adenoviral vectors can transfer the transgene into non-dividing cells. Unfortunately, the episomal nature of these viruses requires repeated administration, which is not possible because repeated injection induces the host's immune response. Adenoviral vectors, in which all viral genes are deleted, are less immunogenic than the first generation adenovectors. Gene therapy using these vectors has resulted in life-long amelioration of jaundice in Gunn rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, it is unlikely that the effect will be long enough to be useful in patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Adenoviral vectors that coexpress UGT1A1 and an inhibitor of immune costimulation (eg, CTLA4Ig) can be administered repeatedly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The long-term efficacy and safety of adenovectors in humans have not yet been ascertained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">SV40 and lentiviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recombinant SV40 and recombinant lentiviruses are newer viral vectors that can transfer genes into non-dividing cells and integrate into the host genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Unlike adenoviruses, their immunogenicity appears to be negligible. However, they do not localize into the liver after systemic administration and, as a result, need to be administered through the portal vein. Initial results with recombinant SV40 viruses in Gunn rats have been encouraging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Receptor-mediated gene delivery to the liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carrier proteins that deliver systemically administered DNA into the liver have also been used in experiments on Gunn rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The expression can be prolonged to several months by inducing cell proliferation by partial hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] or by pharmacological disruption of microtubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Site-directed gene conversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chimeric RNA-DNA molecules have been used to treat genetic disorders by repairing the responsible mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. These chimeric molecules are designed to align with specific sequences at the site of the defect responsible for the disease and create a single mismatch. This triggers the host mismatch repair system to correct the mutation. Preliminary Gunn rat experiments with such chimera have shown that the activity of the enzyme can be restored by inserting the missing guanosine residue into the Gunn rat bilirubin-UGT gene ugt1a1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE II DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II (also known as Arias syndrome) is phenotypically similar to type I disease but the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually less marked (serum bilirubin &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>). The clinical manifestations of this disorder can be illustrated by the original description by Arias in 1962 of eight patients who were between 14 and 52 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In contrast to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, which is associated with jaundice in the first few days of life, only one-half of the patients were icteric before the age of one year; one patient was 30-years-old before jaundice was noted. Despite the cholestasis, patients do not develop pruritus because serum bile salt levels are normal.</p><p>The serum bilirubin concentration in these patients ranged from 8 to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Each had reduced hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activities using bilirubin or other compounds as a glucuronide acceptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All patients were clinically normal, apart from icterus, except for a 43-year-old woman with a neurologic syndrome resembling kernicterus who died at the age of 44 years. Autopsy revealed a histologically normal liver. The brain was small and lacked bilirubin staining but demonstrated the typical histology of kernicterus. Several other cases of neurologic involvement in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II were subsequently described.</p><p>Bilirubin-uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity in the liver in patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is markedly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, the defect is much less severe than in type I disease (residual bilirubin-UGT activity of 2 to 8 percent). In some cases, the residual hepatic bilirubin-UGT activity measured in vitro in the presence of a high bilirubin substrate concentration may suggest up to 38 percent of normal enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, because of a relatively low affinity of the enzyme for bilirubin, the enzyme is catalytically effective only in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia. Bile is pigmented, but only about 50 percent of the bilirubin produced is conjugated and excreted into the bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/19,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,64</a>]. The major conjugate in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is bilirubin monoglucuronide as compared to normal subjects in whom 90 percent of the conjugate is bilirubin diglucuronide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic lesions in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, as in type I disease, are located in one of the five exons that code for the bilirubin-UGT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52393 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. However, in contrast to type I, which can be caused by a variety of mutations, the genetic lesions in type II always consist of point mutations that result in the substitution of a single amino acid which reduces but does not abrogate enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The residual enzyme activity is responsible for the partial conjugation of bilirubin and the lesser degree of hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p>As mentioned above, patients who are compound heterozygotes (having the abnormal promoter of Gilbert syndrome on one allele plus the abnormal bilirubin-uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II on the other) have intermediate levels of hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is usually less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> but can rise to levels as high as 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> during fasting or intercurrent illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Successful pregnancy has been described in women with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. In some cases, the mother had been treated with phenobarbital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

It has been divided into two distinct forms (types I and II) based upon the severity of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I should be suspected in infants who develop persistent jaundice due to indirect reacting (unconjugated) bilirubin within the first few days after birth. These children have an otherwise normal liver function test profile and may have neurologic symptoms due to kernicterus. Occasional patients have late onset kernicterus in adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing between Crigler-Najjar syndromes type I and II can be difficult. As a general rule, type II is associated with lower serum bilirubin concentrations, although values can overlap with type I, especially when there is underlying hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 1</a>). As a result, the differential diagnosis of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I includes Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, with or without coexisting hemolysis (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from type II disease'</a> above). The hallmark of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is usually less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> but can rise to levels as high as 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> during fasting or intercurrent illness. Other liver function tests are normal. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II are much less likely to develop neurologic consequences than those with type I disease. As a result, specific treatment for the hyperbilirubinemia may be unnecessary. However, it may be desirable to treat patients in whom jaundice has impaired the quality of life. For patients who require treatment, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> (60 to 180 mg daily in divided doses in adults and 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> two to three times per day in children), which reduces serum bilirubin levels by at least 25 percent. A response should be expected within two to three weeks. The maintenance dose of phenobarbital needs to be individualized. An equally effective alternative is clofibrate (2 g daily in divided doses in adults), which may be associated with fewer side effects but is contraindicated in pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above). There is less experience with clofibrate than with phenobarbital in the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Once the diagnosis is established, it is usually not necessary to continue the enzyme-inducing drugs on a long-term basis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, phototherapy 8 to 16 hours per day remains the mainstay of treatment. It is important to check regularly the intensity of the fluorescent lamps, which decreases over time. Exposure to sunlight is also an effective form of phototherapy. Oral administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> modestly enhances the hypobilirubinemic effect of phototherapy. Plasmapheresis is reserved for acute increases of serum bilirubin levels or the decline of serum albumin concentrations during intercurrent illness. Liver transplantation remains the definitive therapy and is usually considered around the age of adolescence.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crigler-najjar-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">CRIGLER JF Jr, NAJJAR VA.
