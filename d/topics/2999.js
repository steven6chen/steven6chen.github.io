Children with language disorders are at increased risk for difficulty with reading and written language when they enter school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/case-illustrating-the-evaluation-of-speech-and-language-impairment-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These problems often persist through adolescence or adulthood. Early intervention may prevent the more serious consequences of later learning disabilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Speech and language evaluation in children has three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To determine whether an impairment in communication skills exists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To specify the nature of any impairments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To initiate appropriate intervention strategies</p><p/><p>A case to illustrate the evaluation of a child with a language impairment is presented here. The etiology, evaluation, and treatment of speech and language impairment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of speech and language disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of speech and language disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Concern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Sammy&quot; was four years and two months old when brought for a speech and language evaluation because of &quot;poor back-and-forth communication&quot;. He attended a preschool program where the teachers were confused by his ability to excel in areas such as number and letter recognition and memory skills while experiencing great difficulty in general communication. The parents and teachers wondered if he would do best in an academically accelerated kindergarten that would foster his strengths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history, obtained from the parents through a questionnaire and subsequently in an interview, revealed no difficulties during pregnancy or delivery, immediately following birth, or during early infancy. Sammy had had several middle ear infections prior to the age of three years and suffered from eczema; otherwise, his health had been good. He was described as a peaceful, affectionate, and well-behaved child who seemed eager to learn when interested in the subject matter. He loved looking at books and naming pictures, listening to music, and playing with trains and computers. He responded well to routine and was excessively upset by disruptions in his schedule. Family history for speech, language, or learning difficulties included an aunt who had &quot;some type of learning problem which was never officially diagnosed.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment was conducted with Sammy's parents present in the room because he became upset upon possible separation. He would not cooperate for formal, objective (norm-referenced) testing, so parental report measures and observational data were used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Parental report</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>His parents reported he could follow directions, identify pictures, and point to body parts, but his ability to express himself was limited. He had a large vocabulary but did not always use words meaningfully. He might use a word appropriately on one or two occasions and then not use it again, did not ask questions, and, in general, initiated conversation only to express his needs. He had learned the alphabet, colors, shapes, and numbers by 30 months and easily memorized sentences or phrases in books and movies. Sammy would sometimes use these phrases for no apparent reason. He did not interact well with other children; he tolerated their approaching him but did not initiate or actively maintain interaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sammy played with cars and bubbles for a short period of time, interacting superficially with the examiner. Eye contact was inconsistent. He repeated words and on occasion spontaneously used words to make specified requests. He focused intently on tasks and generally was indifferent to the examiner's presence. His expressive language was characterized by the use of single words to label, protest, and request and by two- and three-word utterances to request. He had difficulty using personal pronouns, relating experiences or past events, and describing pictures. He often was echolalic, imitating words or phrases with the same intonation pattern as the examiner, and used rote, memorized chunks of language. It was determined that his receptive language skills were between the 30- and 33-month levels and that his expressive language fell between the 27- and 30-month levels, with a notable difficulty in the appropriate use of language (pragmatics).</p><p>In addition to the problems with language use and general interactive skills, Sammy exhibited an abnormal preference for routine, inconsistent eye contact, an unusual strength in rote learning, and echolalia, all of which are consistent with the presence of autism spectrum disorder. Subsequently, he was referred to his pediatrician for a <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/medical</span> evaluation that confirmed this diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION AND APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This case highlights some important features of the speech and language evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern by the parents or teachers regarding a child's speech or language should prompt referral for a speech and language evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The information provided by the parents on the questionnaire permitted further probing of areas of possible concern: ear infections, distress and disruption of routine, and family history of a learning problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation and qualitative analysis of the child's performance supplement, and sometimes must substitute for, objective test results; they are essential for making a diagnosis and devising a treatment plan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sammy was reported and observed to have impaired communication skills (inappropriate use of language and inconsistent eye contact), as well as abnormal preference for routine and unusual strength in rote learning. These features suggested his impairment may be caused by autism spectrum disorder. Appropriate intervention strategies could be initiated once the diagnosis was confirmed.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/case-illustrating-the-evaluation-of-speech-and-language-impairment-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lewis BA, Freebairn L.
