These molecules are highly reactive with other biologic molecules, and are referred to as reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-oxidative-stress-in-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Under normal physiologic conditions, the production of oxygen free radicals and peroxides is balanced by an efficient system of antioxidants, which are molecules capable of &quot;scavenging&quot; ROS, thereby preventing oxidative damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-oxidative-stress-in-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Naturally occurring antioxidants are of several types.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the cellular level, enzymatic antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, play an important role in the conversion of ROS to oxygen and water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several nonenzymatic antioxidants are also important in scavenging free radicals.
