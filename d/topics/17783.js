The best known is the effect of increasing body mass. Although GH stimulates generalized growth, it is not evenly distributed among the protein, lipid, and carbohydrate compartments. GH increases total body protein content, decreases total body fat content, and increases fat deposition in the liver. The effects on fat are due to stimulation of lipolysis and reciprocal antagonism of the lipogenic action of insulin in peripheral fat stores. </p><p>GH also increases bone mass by stimulating skeletal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis and causing proliferation of prechondrocytes, hypertrophy of osteoblasts, bone remodeling, and net mineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. GH stimulates cartilage growth. This is most evident as a widening of the epiphyseal plate and is associated with an increase in amino acid incorporation into cartilage and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. GH also stimulates the uptake of sulfate by cartilage in vivo, but not in vitro. However, in vitro sulfate uptake is stimulated by serum from normal or hypophysectomized animals treated with GH. This &quot;sulfation factor&quot; proved to be IGF-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-insulin-like-growth-factor-1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of insulin-like growth factor-1&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GH deficiency is a clinical diagnosis based on auxological features (ie, a comparison of a child's growth pattern to established norms) and confirmed by biochemical testing. Once the decision has been made to evaluate a short child for GH deficiency, several different tests can be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If GH deficiency is congenital and complete, the diagnosis is relatively easy to confirm. Affected children present with early severe growth failure, delayed bone age (if the diagnosis is significantly delayed), central distribution of body fat, and very low serum concentrations of GH, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the major binding protein of circulating IGF-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Infants with GH deficiency are prone to hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, microphallus in males, and giant cell hepatitis. If hypoglycemia is noted, GH treatment should be initiated expeditiously to protect against further episodes.</p><p>For children with milder manifestations of GH deficiency, it may be more difficult to establish the diagnosis. Nonetheless, once the diagnosis is confirmed, such children can and should be treated with GH until linear growth ceases. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1717695935\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATIONS OF GROWTH HORMONE FOR THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several pharmacologic preparations of GH are approved for treatment of GH deficiency in children and others are still being tested:</p><p>Most children with GH deficiency are treated with aqueous biosynthetic (recombinant) GH, which is administered by subcutaneous injection. Several brands of GH have been available for subcutaneous administration for many years, and most information about GH treatment comes from these preparations. They are equally biopotent and have the same natural sequence structure. Most are available in multiple-dose pen devices that facilitate administration. </p><p>Sustained-release preparations of GH for subcutaneous administration are in development, and some are available in a few countries outside of the United States. These are designed for administration once weekly or biweekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH HORMONE TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2714066226\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with GH is indicated for children with GH deficiency whose epiphyses are open. The growth response is greater when GH is initiated at younger versus older age. Therefore, treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed and continued until linear growth ceases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2885124607\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual dosing of GH for the indication of childhood GH deficiency is between 0.16 and 0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week,</span> divided into once daily injections, although doses up to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week</span> are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For most patients, we start at approximately 0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week</span> (35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day)</span>. For patients with severe GH deficiency, we use a lower starting dose of approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day</span> because these individuals have excellent growth responses in this dose range. Daily therapy is more effective than three times weekly at the same total dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Administration of GH in the evening is frequently suggested, based on the rationale that this more closely mimics the predominance of GH secretion during sleep. However, there is no evidence that this dosing schedule is more effective than any other. </p><p>Most endocrinologists adjust the GH dose based on growth response, serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels, and body weight, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H562846\" class=\"local\">'Dose adjustment based on IGF-I response'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, a manufacturer obtained approval for GH dosing up to 0.70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week</span> during puberty, but guidelines recommend against the routine use of this approach because the safety and efficacy are not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1602842828\" class=\"local\">'Dosing during puberty'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562846\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose adjustment based on IGF-I response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum levels of IGF-I should be measured about four weeks after beginning GH treatment or making a dose adjustment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113216\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113216 \">algorithm 1</a>). The GH dose should be lowered if serum IGF-I levels rise above the normal range, as recommended in guidelines from the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This helps to avoid very high IGF-I levels, which are thought to be associated with some of the drug's toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects of growth hormone therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>In our practice, we also use serum IGF-I levels for further adjustments to the GH dose. This &quot;fine-tuning&quot; approach is not endorsed by the PES guidelines because data on adult height outcomes are not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, we choose to use this approach because published intermediate outcomes suggest that IGF-I-based dosing may increase height velocity and is sometimes dose-sparing, presumably because it addresses the variable sensitivity to GH therapy among patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>Various protocols are used for IGF-I-based dose adjustment. In our practice, we measure IGF-I approximately four weeks after beginning GH therapy or changing the dose. We target an IGF-I level in the upper one-half of the normal range (ie, 0 to +2 standard deviation [SD], based on bone age). If the IGF-I level is below this target range, we increase the dose of GH (eg, by 10 to 20 percent) because GH is unlikely to be efficacious if IGF-I levels are very low. If the IGF-I level is above this target range (ie, &gt;+2 SD), we reduce the GH dose (eg, by 10 to 20 percent) because there are some concerns about the safety of high IGF-I levels. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects of growth hormone therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>If GH is increased to &gt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> but IGF-I levels remain low (&lt;-1 SD), the first step is to evaluate for adherence to therapy and proper technique, and for underlying medical problems that might limit growth. If these problems can be excluded and IGF-I levels remain low, the patient may have GH insensitivity. If such patients also fail to have a good growth response to GH therapy, the possibility of a GH insensitivity syndrome should be explored. (See <a href=\"#H562861\" class=\"local\">'Growth response to GH therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone insensitivity syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3552020661\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children who achieve IGF-I at target levels in response to GH therapy, we continue GH at the same dose and monitor the growth response and IGF-I levels periodically during therapy, as outlined below. After four to six months of treatment, the growth response is a more appropriate benchmark rather than the IGF-I level. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562861\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth response to GH therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When given for the treatment of GH deficiency, GH therapy is clearly effective; if GH is administered at an early age, patients can achieve adult height within the midparental target height range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>For children with IGF-I levels in the target range, we recheck length or height at least every four to six months (or every two to three months in infants) and calculate the height velocity to determine whether the growth response is adequate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113216\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113216 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>The child's height velocity should be compared with curves showing normal height velocity for age in children without GH deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96367%7EPEDS%2F96366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366 \">figure 1A-B</a>). During the initial &quot;catch-up&quot; growth period, the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile curve for height velocity is an appropriate target to define an adequate growth response to GH. Catch-up growth should continue until the child's height percentile is in the expected range (eg, at the height percentile corresponding to the midparental height). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Is the child's height velocity impaired?'</a>.) </p><p>Children who have an inadequate growth response to GH therapy should be reevaluated.

The diagnosis is supported by serum testing for antihuman GH antibodies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by genetic testing to determine whether the patient's GH deficiency is caused by a GH gene deletion. These patients respond favorably to treatment with recombinant human IGF-I (mecasermin).

However, the 2016 GH consensus guidelines recommend <strong>against</strong> the routine use of this dosing paradigm because the safety and efficacy are not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The main evidence behind this strategy comes from a single randomized trial of 48 children with GH deficiency who were treated with either standard-dose GH (43 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day)</span> or high-dose GH (70 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day)</span> during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By the end of the pubertal growth spurt, children treated with high-dose GH were approximately 3.6 cm taller than those treated with standard-dose GH. The high dose of GH was, in some cases, associated with marked elevations in serum IGF-I levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms consistent with GH excess (ankle swelling or hip pain). Hence, great care must be employed when using such high doses of GH. Of note, these findings may not be relevant to children whose dose of GH is periodically readjusted during GH therapy based on serum IGF-I levels, as we suggest above. </p><p>Thus, the modest gains in height achieved by giving higher doses of GH during puberty must be balanced against the concerns for adverse effects, which are not well-studied, as well as the substantial cost of the additional GH. In general, effective treatment with GH prior to puberty is more efficacious and cost-effective than efforts to boost growth during puberty. (See <a href=\"#H2706127607\" class=\"local\">'Growth'</a> below.) </p><p>For children with inadequate pubertal growth due to late initiation of GH therapy, adjunctive treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or aromatase inhibitor (in boys) has been explored. However, these treatments are not generally recommended, nor have they been rigorously studied and shown to be effective and safe.

In addition, there appears to be a slightly higher risk of developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension (formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri), increased intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], slipped capital femoral epiphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and worsening of existing scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Whether these are true side effects of GH itself or whether some are related to the rapid growth induced by GH remains unknown. Nonetheless, patients should be routinely monitored for these issues during GH therapy. </p><p>Intracranial hypertension generally occurs shortly after treatment initiation or dose increases, and usually resolves with discontinuation of GH therapy. Treatment can often be resumed at a lower dose without return of symptoms, with slower escalation back up to standard doses. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis also occurs soon after GH therapy is initiated, and routine monitoring is recommended for suggestive symptoms such as hip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> knee pain, and changes in gait. This condition usually requires surgical pinning of the capital femoral epiphysis.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, edema, and arthralgia are more common in adults undergoing GH treatment but are unusual in children. Most usually occur soon after therapy is initiated, and some of these effects are probably caused by sodium and water retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The best information comes from the Safety and Appropriateness of GH treatments in Europe (SAGhE) study, which followed almost 24,000 patients, approximately one-half of whom had isolated growth failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In long-term follow-up, the patients with isolated growth failure had no overall increase in cancer risk (Standardized Incidence Ratio [SIR] 1.0; 95% CI 0.6-1.4) or cancer mortality. The certainty about this conclusion is somewhat limited because of the rarity of cancer in this cohort (23 cases among 11,062 treated subjects) and limited length of follow-up (mean 14.8 years per patient). However, a lack of association with cancer was also found in prior studies with shorter length of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>], including some that focused primarily on leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a <strong>primary cancer diagnosis</strong> that led to the GH treatment, recombinant GH was associated with a modest increase in risk for a secondary cancer (SIR 7.6, 95% CI 6.1-9.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The increased risk was significant for a variety of secondary cancers including bone, melanoma, kidney, brain, thyroid, and leukemia. Cancer mortality increased with GH dose and duration of treatment. Since childhood cancer patients are known to be at increased risk for secondary cancers, due to the underlying cancer itself <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cancer-directed therapy (especially radiation), the increased incidence of secondary cancers among these patients may or may not be related to the GH treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Prior smaller studies of childhood cancer survivors who had been treated with GH noted little or no increased risk for secondary malignancy, except for the development of benign meningiomas after radiation treatment of certain primary brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with <strong>other non-cancer primary diagnoses</strong> that led to GH treatment (eg, Turner syndrome or hypopituitarism without cancer), there was a modest increase in cancer risk (SIR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), primarily due to an excess of bone or bladder cancer, although based on small numbers for each site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For children with cancer (including craniopharyngioma) who develop GH deficiency, guidelines suggest a 12-month waiting period after completion of cancer-directed therapy to confirm that the cancer was eradicated before initiating GH therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stroke</strong> &ndash; A separate study from the French SAGhE group raised concerns for an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in adults who were treated with GH in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

This study does not provide sufficient evidence to change prescribing practices or warrant increased surveillance for stroke in adults who were treated with GH during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p>Prior to 1985, GH was derived from pituitary glands of deceased humans.

Patients should then be retested for GH deficiency using a GH stimulation test to determine if treatment should be continued into adulthood for metabolic indications, ie, to maintain healthy body composition, lipids, and bone mass.</p><p>Among children with <strong>isolated</strong> GH deficiency, more than two-thirds will have normal results when retested for GH deficiency as adults. Because the majority of these patients with isolated GH deficiency during childhood will be GH-sufficient as adults, it is important to repeat the GH stimulation test during the transition period to determine if they will require ongoing therapy. By contrast, GH deficiency is usually permanent in patients with genetic causes of GH deficiency (recognized by a family history of GH deficiency), structural causes of GH deficiency (eg, optic nerve hypoplasia), or organic GH deficiency (eg, caused by brain surgery, brain tumors, intracranial irradiation, or associated with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies).</p><p>The indications, timing, and technique for retesting for GH deficiency during the transition period are discussed in detail separately.

To delay further epiphyseal maturation, adjunctive treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or an aromatase inhibitor has been explored. However, these treatments are not generally recommended for this population because the efficacy and safety have not been established, as outlined below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>GnRH agonist</strong> &ndash; For patients with GH deficiency starting treatment in early- to mid-puberty, a few studies suggest that the addition of a GnRH agonist to GH treatment may result in a taller near-adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. However, the widespread use of this approach in children with GH deficiency remains controversial: Although GnRH agonists can theoretically increase adult height by delaying epiphyseal closure, thereby allowing more time for growth during puberty, long-term treatment (&gt;3 years) is likely required to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, it has not been established that GnRH agonist treatment yields greater increases in height compared with GH treatment alone if GH treatment is initiated prior to puberty. In addition, the clinician must consider multiple issues when considering addition of GnRH agonist therapy, including risks of potential reduced bone mineralization, psychological effects of halting puberty, and cost-benefit analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Instead, it is preferable to make a timely diagnosis of GH deficiency and initiate GH therapy prior to puberty; this usually provides sufficient height gains such that GnRH agonist therapy is not necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aromatase inhibitors</strong> &ndash; For adolescent males, a few studies have explored the possibility of adjunctive treatment with aromatase inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">letrozole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a>), which are theorized to augment growth potential by decreasing estrogen synthesis, thus delaying epiphyseal fusion. As a byproduct, testosterone levels are reciprocally elevated to varying degrees. This approach should be considered experimental because clinical data on outcomes are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. In one study, the addition of anastrozole, a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, for two to three years resulted in a projected mean height gain of 2.67 inches (6.8 cm), compared with a group treated only with GH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

In addition, GH increases lean body mass and bone mass, and reduces fat mass, while increasing plasma and liver lipid content. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic actions of growth hormone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If GH deficiency is congenital and complete, the diagnosis is relatively easy to confirm. Affected children present with severe growth failure and very low serum concentrations of GH, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the major binding protein of circulating IGF-I. Infants with GH deficiency may also manifest hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, microphallus in males, and giant-cell hepatitis. In those diagnosed later, delayed bone age is characteristic. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children diagnosed with GH deficiency, we recommend treating with recombinant GH rather than no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The typical range of starting doses of GH is between 20 and 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day,</span> given subcutaneously once daily (0.16 to 0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week),</span> with the lower end of the range used for patients with severe GH deficiency. Treatment should be started at the youngest possible age to achieve the best growth response. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preparations of growth hormone for therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest measuring IGF-I approximately four weeks after beginning GH treatment or making a dose adjustment, and lowering the GH dose if the level is above the normal range (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is also a reasonable practice to use IGF-I results to &quot;fine-tune&quot; GH doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113216\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113216 \">algorithm 1</a>). This is based upon limited evidence suggesting that IGF-I-based dosing may increase short-term height velocity and is sometimes dose-sparing, although adult height outcomes using this approach are lacking.

We also monitor IGF-I levels every 6 to 12 months.

In addition, a more frequent dosing schedule and higher dose of GH tend to correlate with improved growth outcomes, but this relationship is not linear. (See <a href=\"#H2706127607\" class=\"local\">'Growth'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children who are not likely to achieve an adequate height response to GH because their growth plates are nearing closure, adjunctive therapy to delay epiphyseal maturation may be considered, but the efficacy and safety of these approaches are not well-established. (See <a href=\"#H660580903\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive growth-promoting agents'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend continuing GH therapy at least until linear growth is nearly complete (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) (eg, height velocity less than 2.0 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span>. Patients should then be re-tested for GH deficiency to determine if treatment should be continued into adulthood.
