Hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with therapy may interfere with the implementation and long-term application of &quot;intensive&quot; therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Treatment of type 1 diabetes is directed at physiologic insulin replacement. Many patients with type 2 diabetes also ultimately require insulin therapy as a result of progressive beta cell dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Starter insulin regimens (such as basal insulin monotherapy) for patients with type 2 diabetes commonly require repeated intensification over time to achieve even modest glycated hemoglobin (A1C) reductions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, other therapeutic approaches are needed.</p><p>Glucose homeostasis is dependent on a complex interplay of multiple hormones that may be targets for a multifaceted treatment approach: insulin and amylin, produced by pancreatic beta cells; glucagon, produced by pancreatic alpha cells; and gastrointestinal peptides, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP; gastric inhibitory polypeptide) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59551 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Abnormal regulation of these substances may contribute to the clinical presentation of diabetes.</p><p>The mechanism of action and therapeutic utility of amylin analogs will be reviewed here.

Amylin and insulin have complementary actions in regulating nutrient levels in the circulation.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) exhibits similar properties as amylin, with the exception of insulin secretory effects. Amylin, unlike GLP-1, does not have insulin secretory effects, but both regulate hyperglycemia in part through amelioration of inappropriate glucagon secretion and gastric emptying. GLP-1 and amylin appear to have differing magnitudes of physiologic effects and bind to different receptors in the area postrema, the part of the brain that may be key for their effects on satiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

In a subsequent study, insulin dose was reduced by 25 percent at initiation of pramlintide therapy, which was titrated to the maximum dose over a period of one to two months. With this strategy, there was no increase in hypoglycemia. Premeal insulin doses stabilized at an average of 17 percent lower in pramlintide-treated patients compared with placebo by study end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Thus, rapid-acting insulin analogs taken pre-meal may peak before the glucose peak occurs, increasing the risk of early hypoglycemia followed by delayed hyperglycemia.

Pramlintide precipitates above a pH of 5.5 and must be injected separately from insulin at a different site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The optimal timing for administration is immediately before a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. According to the approved labeling, premeal insulin doses (including premixed insulin) should be reduced by 50 percent and should subsequently be titrated upward to achieve euglycemia once the target pramlintide dose is reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, as noted above, most patients require a smaller reduction in prandial insulin. Patients with near-optimal glycemic control on insulin pumps who utilize the extended wave bolus feature (square wave or dual wave) require minimal prandial insulin dose adjustments (&lt;10 percent) after initiation of pramlintide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramlintide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pramlintide</a> should not be administered to patients with severe hypoglycemia unawareness. Pramlintide should only be administered before meals that contain at least 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrates.
