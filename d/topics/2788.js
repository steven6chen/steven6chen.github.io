The goal of cancer screening is to find those cancers that can be found as early as possible, before a person has any symptoms.</p><p>Different tests can be used to screen for different types of cancers. The age at which screening starts varies depending on the type of cancer being screened for. That's because different cancers tend to strike at different times in a person's life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453435774\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I have cancer screening?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer that is found early often is small and can sometimes be cured or treated easily. Treating certain cancers early can help people live longer. Sometimes, screening finds cells that do not yet show cancer, but that might turn into cancer cells. Doctors often treat this &quot;pre-cancer&quot; before it has a chance to become cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453435781\"><span class=\"h1\">Does everyone have the same cancer screening?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Not everyone is screened for the same types of cancer. And not everyone begins cancer screening at the same age. For example, people with a family history of certain cancers might begin screening at a younger age than people without a family history. People might have repeat screening tests at different times, too. Ask your doctor or nurse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which cancers should I be screened for?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there choices to make about which screening tests to have?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At what age should I begin cancer screening?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often should I be screened?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453435788\"><span class=\"h1\">Does an abnormal screening test result mean that I have cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not always. An abnormal screening test result means that you might have cancer. It does not mean that you definitely have cancer. If you have an abnormal result, your doctor or nurse will probably need to do other tests to find out for sure if anything is wrong. Try not to worry about having cancer until you follow up with your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453435795\"><span class=\"h1\">Which cancers can people be screened for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the types of cancer for which screening tests are available are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breast cancer</strong> &ndash; The main test used to screen for breast cancer is called a &quot;mammogram.&quot; Doctors do not always agree about when women should start having mammograms. But most women start around age 40 or 50. Women who have a strong family history of breast cancer might begin screening earlier. Work with your doctor or nurse to decide when to start breast cancer screening and at what age you might stop screening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Colon cancer</strong> &ndash; There are multiple screening tests for colon cancer. The choice of which test to have is up to you and your doctor. Doctors recommend that most people begin having colon cancer screening at age 50. Some people have an increased chance of getting colon cancer, because of a strong family history or certain medical conditions. These people might begin screening at a younger age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical cancer</strong> &ndash; The main test used to screen for cervical cancer is called a &quot;Pap smear.&quot; Cervical cancer screening often begins when a woman turns 21. Doctors might add on another screening test after a woman turns 30. Women who are older than 65 might or might not need to continue cervical cancer screening. If you are older than 65, talk with your doctor about whether or not you should keep getting screened.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prostate cancer</strong> &ndash; The main test used to screen for prostate cancer is called a &quot;PSA test.&quot; It is unclear whether getting screened for prostate cancer can extend a man's life or help him feel better. For this reason, most experts do not recommend routine prostate cancer screening. Instead, experts recommend that each man work with his doctor to decide whether screening is right for him. In most cases, men should start discussing prostate cancer screening around the age of 50. Most doctors do not recommend screening for men age 70 or older or for men with serious health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung cancer</strong> &ndash; The main test used to screen for lung cancer is an imaging test called a &quot;low dose CT scan.&quot; If you are at high risk of lung cancer, for example, because you smoke, ask your doctor about the risks and benefits of screening. If you really want to reduce your chances of getting or dying from lung cancer, the best thing you can do is to stop smoking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ovarian cancer</strong> &ndash; To screen for ovarian cancer, doctors can do a blood test, an imaging test called an ultrasound, or both. But these tests do not always find early ovarian cancer. Still, the tests are sometimes used in women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer. For them, screening might begin at age 30 to 35. Screening is not recommended for women who do not have a family history of ovarian or breast cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453435802\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-screening-psa-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prostate cancer screening (PSA tests) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pap-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pap tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lung cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-prevention-and-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lung cancer prevention and screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Prostate cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
