The use of perfluorochemicals, rather than nitrogen, as the inert carrier of oxygen and carbon dioxide offers a number of theoretical advantages for the treatment of acute lung injury, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing surface tension by maintaining a fluid interface with alveoli</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opening of collapsed alveoli by hydraulic pressure with a lower risk of barotrauma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing a reservoir in which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged with pulmonary capillary blood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functioning as a high efficiency heat exchanger</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobilizing alveolar and airway debris and exudates</p><p/><p>Despite its theoretical advantages, efficacy studies have been disappointing and the optimal clinical use of LV has yet to be defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The technique and potential applications of LV will be reviewed here. Conventional and alternative modes of gas-phase mechanical ventilation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPERTIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal fluid for liquid ventilation (LV) is nontoxic, has a low surface tension, is capable of dissolving large amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide, has minimal systemic absorption, and is chemically stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Following work with hyperbaric saline ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], researchers demonstrated that perfluorochemicals (PFCs) had many of these properties and could be used as a medium for liquid breathing in rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PFCs are organic compounds in which some carbon-bound hydrogen atoms have been replaced with fluorine atoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Perflubron (LiquiVent), the only medical grade PFC available for use in human LV trials, consists of a long, linear-fluorinated hydrocarbon chain. Perflubron contains one bromide atom, making it radiopaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Hundreds of different PFC fluids with unique biomedical properties exist. The structure of several examples of these compounds is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80558 \">figure 1</a>). The table compares the physical properties of air, water, and saline with three PFCs that have been studied for liquid ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52864 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>PFC fluids are clear, colorless, odorless, and inert. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases are highly soluble in these fluids; they can dissolve over 15 times the amount of oxygen per given volume as plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. PFCs are poor solvents for most other biological compounds.</p><p>PFCs are stable, insoluble in water, can be stored indefinitely at room temperature, and can be autoclaved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In contrast to saline, PFCs do not wash out surfactant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Almost all PFC fluids have low surface tension and are nonbiotransformable. However, PFCs have a high viscosity, which makes their flow characteristics problematic under certain circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very small amounts of PFCs diffuse into the pulmonary capillary blood and dissolve in blood lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of uptake in the blood depends upon the PFC vapor pressure, permeability coefficients of the blood vessels, solubility of the particular PFC used, and the degree of <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> matching.</p><p>Absorbed PFCs are scavenged by macrophages. The main route of PFC elimination is through the lungs via volatilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. To a smaller degree, the chemicals are eliminated through the skin by transpiration. Perflubron blood concentrations are low but measurable, and persist for at least eight days following administration of the last dose of perflubron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Perflubron may persist in extrapulmonary tissues for years following LV. Two case reports note the continued presence of perflubron in the mediastinum, the retroperitoneum, and the pleural space for nine and twelve years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two methods of perfluorochemical (PFC)-based liquid ventilation have been used: total (tidal) liquid ventilation and partial liquid ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Total liquid ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In total liquid ventilation (TLV), the entire lung is filled with an oxygenated PFC liquid, and a liquid tidal volume of PFC is actively pumped into and out of the lungs. A specialized apparatus is required to deliver and remove the relatively dense, viscous PFC tidal volumes, and to extracorporeally oxygenate and remove carbon dioxide from the liquid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/2,9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,16</a>].</p><p>TLV is initiated by insufflating the desired volume of pre-oxygenated PFC liquid (functional residual capacity plus tidal volume) into the lungs using a gravity-assisted device or more specialized equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Optimum ventilation and oxygenation depend upon adequate minute ventilation coupled with sufficient time for diffusion of respiratory gases to and from the PFC liquid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. During the maintenance phase of TLV, a low respiratory rate (eg, four to six breaths per minute) is set with an inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At these respiratory rates and timing ratios, PFC fluid dwells in the lung long enough for diffusion of respiratory gases to occur, thus effecting pulmonary gas exchange. Tidal volumes and peak inspiratory and positive end expiratory pressures (PEEP) are adjusted based upon pulmonary mechanics and blood gases in the same manner as when gas ventilation is employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TLV is weaned when sufficient clinical improvement has occurred such that gas ventilation will be adequate to support the patient; specific weaning parameters and techniques have not been fully evaluated. The return to gas ventilation is accomplished by a transition through a period of partial liquid ventilation (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Partial liquid ventilation'</a> below). PFC liquid is removed at the end of the expiratory phase, leaving a volume of PFC fluid equivalent to the functional residual capacity of the lung. Gas ventilation is begun, and the PFC fluid is not replaced or augmented as it is evaporated; elimination from the lung by evaporation generally requires one to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. In some cases, small amounts of PFC are radiographically apparent in the lungs for several weeks or longer without apparent ill effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial liquid ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In partial liquid ventilation (PLV), the lungs are slowly filled with a volume of PFC equivalent or close to the FRC during gas ventilation. The PFC within the lungs is oxygenated and carbon dioxide is removed by means of gas breaths cycling in the lungs by a conventional gas ventilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>PLV is initiated by insufflating PFC liquid (approximately 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> into the lungs using an intravenous syringe pump or by slowly pushing the fluid in over a 15-minute to one-hour period. The functional residual capacity is reached when a meniscus of PFC is present within the endotracheal tube at end-expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>As the fluid evaporates out of the lungs, it is intermittently and gradually replaced with additional PFC at approximately 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hr</span> to maintain a total liquid volume of functional residual capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Typically, but not exclusively, pressure-controlled ventilation with the addition of PEEP is used to deliver gas ventilation, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) and PEEP are adjusted based upon pulmonary mechanics and blood gases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Airway suctioning is still required with PLV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PLV is discontinued by ceasing to replace the PFC that is lost through evaporation. Most of the intrapulmonary PFC evaporates in the next one to seven days, allowing a transition to gas ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLV allows the lavage and removal of lung secretions, meconium, or alveolar edema from the lower airways to a greater extent than PLV. In addition, the distribution of PFC within the lungs may be more uniform during TLV than PLV. However, TLV requires a specialized delivery apparatus, and increased airway resistance can make the tidal delivery of viscous PFCs difficult.</p><p>PLV provides some of the same benefits as TLV by maintaining a liquid interface in the alveoli, but does not require specialized equipment. The technique may also be possible in some patients in whom elevated airway resistance precludes the use of TLV. Periodic repositioning of the patient is required with both modes to ensure optimal distribution of PFC fluid within the lungs, but is more important in PLV to maintain a liquid interface in as many alveoli as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liquid ventilation (LV) offers a number of theoretical advantages over conventional gas ventilation, including better gas exchange and functional lung recovery by any of several mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alveolar recruitment &ndash; Filling of alveoli with liquid rather than gas eliminates air-liquid interfaces and greatly reduces surface tension forces. Collapsed alveoli may also be recruited and stabilized by the hydraulic forces provided during LV. Alveolar expansion and stability is thus facilitated at much lower airway pressures, reducing the risk of barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. As more alveoli are filled with oxygen-rich perfluorochemical (PFC), the effective diffusing surface of the lung increases and is reflected by improvement in arterial oxygenation and compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> matching &ndash; PFC fluids are denser than water and therefore deposit in dependent regions of the lungs. They improve <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> matching by facilitating gas exchange in lung units that were previously perfused but unventilated. The weight of PFCs within dependent lung zones also may redistribute pulmonary blood flow to nondependent zones that were previously ventilated but unperfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lavage &ndash; LV facilitates the removal of exudative material from the lung but does not interfere substantially with the production or function of surfactant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. During TLV, the cyclical removal and replacement of PFC liquid may cleanse the lungs while maintaining gas exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. During PLV, exudative material in the peripheral airways and alveoli is lavaged to the central airways for removal via suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiinflammatory effects &ndash; Some studies suggest reduced neutrophil and alveolar macrophage responses exist in the presence of PFCs, including attenuation of neutrophil adhesion, activation, and migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-33</a>]. Preclinical studies suggest perfluorocarbons inhibit inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammatory mediator signaling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and attenuate ICAM-1 expression in injured alveolar cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The removal of inflammatory cells and their mediators from the alveolar spaces may also provide benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>]. Finally, filling of the alveolus with PFCs may provide a mechanical barrier to intraalveolar exudation and leukocyte <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> red blood cell translocation, with potential beneficial effects in reducing the intensity of inflammation and secondary lung injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temperature regulation &ndash; PFC liquids have a higher heat capacity than conventional gas mixtures. This allows the lung and pulmonary circulation to act as an internal heat exchanger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. PFC liquids can be used to warm the lungs and increase core body temperature or cool the lungs and decrease core body temperature, as required by clinical circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The unique properties of perfluorochemical (PFC)-based liquid ventilation (LV) make the technique potentially useful in a variety of situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal applications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns can suffer from a variety of lung diseases that may respond favorably to LV.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory distress syndrome &ndash; Exogenous surfactant therapy in infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) is limited by unequal delivery and distribution within the injured or premature lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. LV may facilitate more uniform endogenous surfactant distribution, and may be of use in surfactant-unresponsive cases.

Early studies using total liquid ventilation (TLV) reported an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance with a decrease in cardiac index of approximately 40 percent, which resulted in lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This probably was a consequence of lung overexpansion, which may decrease cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. In contrast, adverse direct hemodynamic effects appear uncommon during partial liquid ventilation (PLV).</p><p>Other adverse effects observed during PFC LV include mucous plug formation, pneumothoraces, and bleeding complications, but it is unclear to what degree these relate to LV rather than the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Morphologic, biochemical, and pathologic examination of numerous mature and immature species has revealed no adverse effects of PFCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The long-term adverse effects of breathing PFCs appear to be negligible but remain under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>LV potentially can complicate some of the supportive and general care that ventilated patients receive in the intensive care unit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFC fluid is almost twice as dense as saline, and patient weights should not be followed as the sole index of fluid balance when LV is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A dry weight should be obtained before the start of LV, and patients should be weighed again immediately after the lungs are filled with PFC fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFCs are radiopaque and will eliminate much of the diagnostic utility of chest radiography. All lung tissue will appear opacified during TLV; during PLV, an anterior-posterior supine film may appear uniformly radiopaque, but a lateral view of the chest will reveal the distribution of PFC primarily within the dependent portions of the lung. A chest radiograph should be obtained prior to and within an hour of filling the lung with PFC fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart sounds are more distinct during TLV than PLV. Breath sounds during PLV are notable for the presence of fine rales and coarse rhonchi. No audible breath sounds are present during TLV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of LV upon the development of nosocomial pneumonia is uncertain. Lavaging the lung of infectious exudate during LV may be beneficial, but this may be offset by the loss of diagnostic information usually provided by chest radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,26,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,26,41</a>]. PFCs are thought to be inert.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of liquid ventilation is unpleasant for the patient, and therefore deep sedation and paralysis are necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. The principles of using sedative and paralytic agents are similar to those applied when conventional gas ventilation is employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive doses of perflubron may explain the negative results of early human trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. This is supported by an animal study, in which rats given a low dose (7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> of perflubron had less microvascular lung injury than rats given a near functional residual capacity dose (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> of perflubron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, in preterm lambs, varying the dose of perfluorocarbon had no effect on cerebral blood flow velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Future efforts may involve studying the effects of various doses of perflubron.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liquid ventilation (LV) is a technique of mechanical ventilation in which the lungs are insufflated with oxygenated perfluorochemical (PFC) liquid rather than gas. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFC liquids are stable and nontoxic, with minimal systemic absorption. They dissolve large amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide; thus, they are ideal for gas exchange. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Properties'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two techniques of PFC-based liquid ventilation have been used, total (tidal) liquid ventilation and partial liquid ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theoretical advantages of LV over conventional gas ventilation include recruitment and stabilization of alveoli, improvement in <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> matching, removal of exudative material from the lung, direct anti-inflammatory effects, and temperature regulation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In theory, LV may be of benefit for numerous neonatal and adult diseases. Clinical trials, however, have shown little improvement in important clinical outcomes. As a result, LV cannot be recommended in routine clinical care. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Potential indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects observed during LV include mucous plug formation, pneumothoraces, and bleeding complications, although it is unclear whether these were due to LV or the underlying disease. LV can complicate the supportive and general care of patients. For example, patient weight cannot be followed as an index of fluid balance and deep sedation and paralysis is required. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Adverse Effects'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Degraeuwe PL, Vos GD, Blanco CE.
