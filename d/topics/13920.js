The bulk of injuries to this ligament occur in combination with other internal derangements of the knee in association with multi-ligament trauma; isolated PCL injuries are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The PCL is the knee ligament least frequently injured during sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Over time, increasing knowledge of the anatomy and biomechanics of this ligament has highlighted its importance with regard to knee stability and function. As isolated injury is uncommon, the natural history of injury has yet to be elucidated fully.</p><p>The presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and nonoperative management of PCL injuries are reviewed here. Other knee injuries and an overall approach to knee complaints in active adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medial collateral ligament injury of the knee&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lateral collateral ligament injury and related posterolateral corner injuries of the knee&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413038\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the largest and strongest of the intra-articular ligaments of the knee, originating at the lateral border of the medial femoral condyle and inserting at the posterior tibia in a depression called the PCL facet (fovea centralis) that lies between the medial and lateral tibial plateaus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90208\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90208 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89730\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89730 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65193\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65193 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,9</a>]. The PCL is considered an intra-articular but extra-synovial structure because of the synovial sheath that lines the ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The extra-synovial location accounts for the limited swelling seen with isolated PCL injuries. Due to its association with the posterior capsule, blood supply to the PCL is not permanently lost with an intrasubstance tear. This permits primary surgical repair in some cases of PCL injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The PCL is structurally divided into two distinct yet inseparable bundles identified as the larger anterolateral (AL) and the smaller posteromedial (PM) bundles. These bundles are distinguished based on function, with each bundle exhibiting different patterns of tension and relaxation depending upon the degree of knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,9</a>]. The PCL works in concert with the meniscofemoral ligaments, which together make up the PCL complex. The meniscofemoral ligaments originate from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus and insert on the medial femoral condyle anterior to the PCL (ligament of Humphrey inserts anteriorly) and posteriorly to the PCL (ligament of Wrisberg inserts posteriorly). While anchoring the lateral meniscus, these ligaments also act as a secondary restraint to posterior tibial translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/2,4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,8,9</a>].</p><p>The primary role of the PCL complex is to restrict posterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur, while also acting as a secondary restraint to external rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. In addition, the PCL protects the extended knee from varus and valgus stress. The role of the PCL in providing posterior knee stability increases as the knee is brought into flexion. The PCL provides 95 percent of posterior stability when the knee is flexed between 30 and 90 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Each bundle of the PCL contributes to joint stability based upon its distinctive fiber orientation in relation to the degree of knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. Essentially, tension in each bundle develops in a reciprocal fashion during knee flexion and extension: The AL bundle becomes slack in extension but progressively more taut with knee flexion; the PM bundle is tight in extension but becomes progressively more slack with knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Therefore, it may be more useful to consider the PCL as a single, complex structure with a continuum of fibers of different lengths and varying tensions depending on the degree of knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The posterolateral complex (PLC) consists of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), iliotibial band (ITB), popliteus tendon, popliteofibular ligament, arcuate ligament, and posterolateral joint capsule. The PLC is an important secondary constraint against posterior tibial translation, with a primary function of resisting varus and external rotational forces. The amount of posterior tibial translation increases significantly when both the PCL and PLC are injured. The clinician must be aware of this intimate anatomical relationship as an injury to both structures suggests a need for prompt surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lateral collateral ligament injury and related posterolateral corner injuries of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413044\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury is reported to range from 1 to 44 percent of all knee injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/3,5,6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6,10</a>]. This wide variability in incidence probably exists because of the subtlety with which isolated injuries can present. One report supports the notion that isolated PCL injury is rare, comprising only 3.5 to 7.5 percent of trauma-related injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Common associated knee injuries involve the posterior lateral corner, anterior cruciate ligament, and medial collateral ligament. Many individuals who have sustained an isolated PCL injury continue to function at a high level in sports and so may not present to clinicians, thus lowering the reported incidence. Another study found a 2 percent incidence of asymptomatic PCL injury among college American football players presenting for examination prior to the National Football League (NFL) draft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/2,3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,11</a>].</p><p>The main cause of PCL injury is high-energy trauma, most often involving motor vehicle collisions (MVC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/5,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,12</a>]. Sporting activities are the second most common cause of injury, and are less likely to result in combined ligament injury. According to a retrospective study of 19,530 sports-related injuries, the PCL is among the least likely structures to be injured in athletics comprising up to 0.65 percent of all athletic-related knee injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Another large retrospective analysis found that 45 percent of PCL injuries were due to MVCs, while 40 percent were related to athletic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this study, motorcycle accidents made up 28 percent of the motor vehicle injuries, while football (soccer) was the sport most often associated with PCL injury (25 percent). MVCs accounted for up to 63.8 percent of cases involving combined ligamentous injuries of the knee, compared with athletic injury, which accounted for 47.5 percent of such cases. Studies providing additional insight into the rates of PCL injury in particular sports are not available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413050\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries may be sustained from high- or low-energy trauma. High-energy mechanisms, primarily motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), may cause PCL injury when a posteriorly directed sheer force is applied to a flexed knee (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103923\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103923 \">figure 3</a>). One example is the classic &quot;dashboard injury&quot; in which the anterior knee, including the proximal tibia, of the driver or a front seat passenger collides with the car's dashboard. When such a force is combined with varus rotation, the lateral or posterolateral structures of the knee may be injured in addition to the PCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/2,3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,12</a>].</p><p>PCL injuries sustained during athletics typically occur when an athlete falls on their flexed knee while the foot is plantarflexed or from a direct blow to the anterior knee. In addition, the PCL and posterior capsule can be torn by a hyperflexion or hyperextension mechanism, with or without a posterior-directed force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/2,3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,12</a>]. Valgus and varus forces applied to the knee can cause a PCL injury, but such mechanisms typically involve injuries to multiple knee structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413056\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of patients with a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury varies depending upon the nature of the trauma involved (high versus low energy) and associated injuries and comorbidities. PCL injuries sustained from high-energy trauma are frequently associated with additional knee injuries, including damage to the posterolateral corner, anterior cruciate ligament, and medial collateral ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Particularly in cases of low-energy trauma, a careful history detailing the mechanism of injury is important for identifying PCL injury. PCL injury can be classified further based on the timing of injury (acute versus chronic) and severity (isolated versus multi-ligamentous). These variables affect treatment and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>As the large majority of PCL injuries are sustained during motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for ligamentous knee injury, including complete knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation, for any patient complaining of knee pain or dysfunction following high-energy trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Knee dislocation can cause severe morbidity from vascular disruption if not recognized and treated immediately. Knee injuries associated with high-velocity trauma often present with severe hemarthrosis, inability to bear weight, gross instability, and decreased range of motion. Assessments of knee dislocation and of the patient involved in major trauma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PCL injuries sustained from low-energy trauma (eg, sporting injuries) may present with gross instability, particularly if associated with injuries to posterolateral knee structures, or with more subtle symptoms that can make diagnosis difficult. The presentation of an isolated PCL injury is often subtle, and quite different from that of an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which often involves an acute popping sensation perceived by the athlete at the time of injury, typically while performing a quick pivoting maneuver or landing from a jump, followed by the development of a large knee effusion. Patients with an isolated PCL injury generally do not report feeling or hearing such a &quot;pop.&quot; They may have a mild to moderate knee effusion, a slight limp, pain in the back of the knee (especially with squatting or kneeling), and loss of terminal knee flexion (final 10 to 20 degrees). Complaints of joint instability are more common with multiple knee ligament injuries than an isolated PCL injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1-3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,10</a>]. Acutely, many of these athletes may continue to play sports and not seek medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. An athlete's only complaint may be a sensation that &quot;something's not right&quot; in the knee or of generalized knee pain; the patient may have difficulty being more precise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Patients suffering from a chronically injured PCL-deficient knee present more often with generalized anterior knee pain that may localize to the medial compartment or patellofemoral joint. According to an observational study of tibiofemoral motion involving open-access magnetic resonance imaging of patients with a PCL-deficient knee, altered kinematics related to PCL deficiency cause a fixed anterior subluxation of the medial femoral condyle in relation to the medial tibial plateau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This appears to increase the risk for degenerative changes in the medial knee. In this study, imaging was performed while patients performed several weight-bearing movements. The lateral compartment of the knee appears to be unaffected by the compressive forces created by PCL deficiency.</p><p>Patients with a chronic PCL-deficient knee may complain more of disability than instability that is most noticeable when negotiating inclines such as stairs or ramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/2,3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10</a>]. Athletes presenting with a chronic injury may complain of pain when sprinting or decelerating and mild instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many individuals with chronic PCL insufficiency are found to have been injured in a previous MVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Such patients often sustained life-threatening injuries that caused the knee injury to be overlooked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413062\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68876709\"><span class=\"h2\">General knee examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients presenting immediately following a motor vehicle collision (MVC) or other high-energy trauma, a precise knee examination may not be possible due to severe pain and swelling, or the need to perform urgent diagnostic imaging (eg, assessment of the popliteal artery from suspected knee dislocation) or more urgent interventions. Whenever possible, the knee is thoroughly examined as part of the secondary trauma survey. Of crucial importance is assessing for major vascular injury of the injured extremity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients presenting with knee pain following low-energy trauma or with chronic complaints, it is important to perform a careful knee examination paying close attention to joint stability and function. The knee examination is reviewed in detail separately; elements of the examination of particular importance to the assessment of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The knee examination begins with careful inspection, using the uninjured lower extremity for comparison. Asymmetries can be appreciated by watching the patient's stance and gait. Findings may include swelling, joint effusion, muscle atrophy, malalignment (eg, varus or valgus), and ecchymosis or other skin changes. In patients with a PCL injury, general inspection and palpation of the knee while the patient is supine may reveal a mild to moderate effusion, or possibly no effusion in case of chronic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>With acute isolated PCL injury, the patient may manifest an antalgic gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Depending upon the patient's anatomy and concomitant injuries, any of several gait abnormalities may be present. Loss of restraints against external rotation of the tibia (best evaluated by the dial test) in combination with tibia vara or genu recurvatum can produce a varus thrust gait or knee hyperextension in combination with a varus thrust gait, best noted during the stance phase of the gait cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The varus thrust pattern consists of a dynamic lateral bowing of the knee during the weight-bearing phase of gait, which places a greater load on the medial knee. Other patients may walk with a slightly flexed knee in order to avoid the pain and instability associated with a varus thrust or varus hyperextension gait pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. These abnormal gait patterns are typically more pronounced with combined PCL and posterolateral corner (PLC) injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-18</a>].</p><p>Examination findings in the patient with a chronically PCL-deficient knee are generally more subtle. Suggestive findings may include tibia vara (bow legged) or genu recurvatum (hyperextended knee) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,14,15,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15,17,19</a>]. Comparison with the uninjured extremity is often useful. Tibia vara, which may stem from progressive incompetence of posterolateral knee structures injured at the same time as the PCL, is best seen while inspecting the weight-bearing patient from behind. Genu recurvatum, which may develop from abnormal alignment due to posterior subluxation of the tibia, is best evaluated by observing sagittal knee alignment while the patient is weightbearing.</p><p>Following inspection, the knee is palpated for signs of injury, although with acute PCL injuries, findings other than effusion may be scant. It is difficult to differentiate using palpation the structures of the posterolateral corner (PLC), which is commonly injured in association with the PCL. Few structures are palpable in the posterior fossa, the space between the medial and lateral hamstring tendons, but the area may be tender. The lateral collateral (LCL) and medial collateral (MCL) ligaments should be palpated, and focal tenderness at these ligaments suggests injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As it can be difficult to distinguish the LCL from the biceps femoris tendon and iliotibial band at the joint line, the examiner should begin palpation at the lateral femoral condyle and follow the cordlike LCL distally as it crosses over the joint line towards the fibular head.</p><p>Following palpation, active knee flexion is assessed by having the supine patient flex the knee maximally, bringing the heel as close as possible to the gluteal fold. Flexion can be measured in degrees using a goniometer or by the minimum distance between the heels and the closest gluteal surface. Normal flexion is approximately 130 degrees. If an effusion is present, as seen in acute PCL injury, it is likely that active terminal flexion will be reduced by 10 to 20 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The clinician should determine the position of the tibia in relation to the femur with the knee flexed to 90 degrees. This enables detection of asymmetries and allows for correction of posterior subluxation of the tibia in the PCL-injured knee. In the normal knee, the medial tibial plateau lies approximately 1 cm anterior to the medial femoral condyle when the knee is flexed to 90 degrees. PCL injury should be suspected if this step-off is absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. As described below, it is important to avoid confusing a PCL injury for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury when performing an anterior drawer or Lachman test with the knee in this position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>As other knee ligaments are commonly injured along with the PCL, it is important to test the joint for laxity. The ACL is best assessed using the Lachman and anterior drawer maneuvers, while the MCL or LCL are assessed with the valgus and varus stress tests respectively, at 0 and 30 degrees of flexion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Assessing joint stability'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68876715\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests for PCL injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary tests used to assess the integrity of the PCL and posterior knee include the posterior drawer test, posterior sag sign, and quadriceps active test.

Prior to performing the posterior drawer test, the clinician must ascertain the position of the tibia relative to the femur.

A presumptive clinical diagnosis can often be made based upon the mechanism of injury and examination findings. A direct blow to the anterior portion of a flexed knee from a car dashboard, an opponent, or the ground is the most common mechanism, while a positive posterior drawer test, posterior sag sign, and quadriceps active test are highly suggestive findings. (See <a href=\"#H9413050\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9413056\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9413062\" class=\"local\">'Examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p>Establishing a definitive diagnosis of chronic PCL injury can be difficult as both MRI and direct visualization using arthroscopy have limitations. As PCL tears can heal over time, MRI studies of chronic injuries may fail to identify such injuries, although degenerative changes found in the medial and patellofemoral compartments of the knee are suggestive. A PCL tear may be difficult to detect using arthroscopy because the PCL is partially obscured by the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and may appear intact despite clinical laxity and the existence of a partial tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/20,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413141\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC CONSULT OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon our clinical experience and that of our surgical colleagues, and the limited available published evidence, we suggest that the following injuries be referred to a knowledgeable orthopedic surgeon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries &ndash; Anterior border of medial tibial plateau can be displaced posteriorly beyond the anterior border of the medial femoral condyle (posterior displacement &gt;10 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] ).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCL injuries associated with any fracture or any additional soft tissue injuries of significance (eg, injury of the posterolateral corner, anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] injury, meniscal tear).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCL disruption involving avulsion of the ligamentous insertion at the tibia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition, if the clinical picture is unclear or the patient is a high-level athlete, it is reasonable to obtain orthopedic consultation. We suggest that acute isolated PCL injuries (ie, Grade 1 and 2 injuries) be managed nonoperatively, as outlined below. Should appropriate nonoperative management of a Grade 1 or Grade 2 PCL injury be unsuccessful (eg, patient experiences persistent pain or instability), orthopedic consultation should be obtained. However, given the limitations of current surgical interventions, we adhere to a course of physical therapy and nonoperative management for as long as possible, and generally wait up to 12 months before referring patients with lower grade PCL injuries. We refer patients with a chronic, isolated PCL injury to a knowledgeable orthopedic surgeon <strong>IF</strong> they have developed functional instability or symptoms, such as recurrent effusions or worsening pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Otherwise, we begin treatment with an appropriate physical therapy program. (See <a href=\"#H9413208\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> below.)</p><p>It is vitally important that the treating clinician has, by examination and imaging, confirmed the diagnosis of <strong>isolated</strong> PCL injury, and determined its grade, before making a determination about the need for consultation. A multi-ligamentous knee injury is vastly different than an isolated PCL injury, with far greater associated morbidity, and surgical consultation is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413147\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries, particularly those sustained in high-energy trauma, are often associated with other injuries of the knee and elsewhere. Important injuries to consider when PCL tear is suspected include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413154\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms of injury associated with PCL trauma may also injure the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, the history and examination findings associated with ACL tears are generally distinct from those of PCL tears. Athletes who sustain an ACL injury often hear or feel an acute &quot;pop&quot; at the time of injury, and the mechanism generally involves a quick pivoting maneuver or landing from a jump, followed acutely by the development of a large knee effusion. The knee often feels unstable and a Lachman test is positive. It is important that the Lachman maneuver be performed correctly to avoid a false positive result. Should a definitive diagnosis be required, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) readily distinguishes between these two acute injuries. (See <a href=\"#H68876709\" class=\"local\">'General knee examination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413166\"><span class=\"h2\">Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LCL and PLC injuries are often sustained in combination with PCL injury, particularly following high-energy trauma, and must be distinguished from isolated PCL injuries as multi-ligament trauma typically requires surgical intervention. In the presence of an LCL injury, a varus stress maneuver reveals abnormal widening and pain at the lateral joint line; the maneuver does not provoke such widening or pain with an isolated PCL injury. Likewise, the examination maneuvers commonly used to assess the PLC (external rotation recurvatum test, posterolateral drawer test, reverse pivot shift test, and dial test at 30 and 90 degrees) are unlikely to be positive in the setting of an isolated PCL injury. MRI is highly accurate for identifying injury to the LCL and PLC in addition to the PCL, but the radiologist must be consulted to ensure that the appropriate imaging protocol is used.

Meniscal injuries often present with nonspecific mechanical symptoms, such as popping, locking or catching of the knee joint, and functional instability, which may also be present with PCL injuries. Pain and disability are comparable, and signs such as mild to moderate effusions may be similar. Differences in the physical examination include joint line tenderness and positive McMurray and Thessaly maneuvers, which are often present with meniscal injury, and the posterior sag and posterior drawer tests, which are positive in the presence of PCL injury but not with isolated meniscal injuries. Diagnostic imaging may be needed to distinguish these two injuries.

Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) causing direct trauma to the knee or hyperextension injuries sustained on the athletic field are common mechanisms for both types of injury. Typically, a tibial fracture presents with a hemarthrosis, which manifests as a larger effusion than is typically seen with PCL injury, and substantial pain, which is also uncharacteristic of an isolated PCL injury. Pain and guarding from a tibial fracture are likely to prevent the clinician from performing examination maneuvers that can distinguish between the two injuries. Plain radiographs usually reveal a tibial fracture.

The clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for such injury in any patient complaining of knee pain or dysfunction following significant knee trauma. Knee dislocation is typically sustained through high-energy trauma (eg, MVC) and causes severe pain and gross instability of the knee. Swelling is generally severe and there may be obvious deformity, assuming the dislocation does not reduce spontaneously.

Bone contusions can cause significant pain and disability, causing restrictions in knee motion, and possibly an effusion. However, the posterior sag and posterior drawer tests are negative in the patient with an isolated bone contusion. In difficult cases where the examination is limited and a definitive diagnosis is required, MRI readily distinguishes between these two acute injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530846305\"><span class=\"h2\">Patellar and quadriceps tendon tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both tendon tears and PCL injuries can occur with a fall onto a flexed knee. However, when such trauma causes a patellar or quadriceps tendon tear, the patient often reports feeling a &quot;pop&quot; in their knee along with some degree of immediate disability and a knee effusion. These presenting symptoms and signs are highly atypical of a PCL injury. Patients with tendon tears are generally unable to bear weight on the injured leg or to perform a straight leg raise, whereas patients with a PCL injury are usually able to do both, although posterior sag of the tibia may be noted during the straight leg raise. Often, there is a palpable defect and reproducible tenderness when examining a torn patellar or quadriceps tendon, while such findings are not found with PCL injuries. On plain radiographs, the height of the patella may be altered (patella alta or baja) or signs of a patellar avulsion injury may be present in patients with tendon tears. If obtained, an MRI clearly distinguishes between these two injury types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quadriceps-muscle-and-tendon-injuries#H11185653\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quadriceps muscle and tendon injuries&quot;, section on 'Quadriceps and patellar tendon tears'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413202\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the treating clinician has established that there is no need for referral, initial treatment of an isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury involves standard management of pain and functional disability if present. The basic principles of protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and medications (PRICE-M) apply.</p><p>We suggest maintaining the affected knee in hinged knee brace locked in full extension for approximately two weeks in order to reduce posterior lag in the acutely injured knee. Alternatively, a standard knee immobilizer may be used. After two weeks, the brace is unlocked to allow progressive range of motion exercises. There is no high-quality evidence supporting this approach, but we and some others consider immobilization in extension to be an important part of initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Chronic PCL-deficient knees do not require bracing unless the patient reports a high degree of functional instability; if a brace is used in this setting, it should be unlocked.</p><p>PCL injuries themselves generally do not cause significant pain or joint effusion, but these may develop due to associated bone contusions. Therefore, appropriate rest may require a period of limited weight-bearing using crutches. The use of crutches is intended for pain control and is not mandatory. Ice applied to the knee, elastic compression wraps (eg, ACE wraps), and elevation of the affected extremity above heart level may be needed to reduce swelling and discomfort. Analgesic medications may be needed for pain. Options may include a short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Opioids are typically unnecessary.

Early rehabilitation following an acute, isolated PCL injury consists primarily of general mobility and open-chain quadriceps exercises. These include ankle pumps (active dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankles) and quad sets (active contraction of the quad with the knee in extension). The goal of early rehabilitation is to prevent joint stiffness and encourage recruitment of the quadriceps, which the patient may have difficulty activating due to pain or joint effusion. Full strength and function of the quadriceps is needed for full recovery, and thus addressing this muscle group early in the course of treatment is important. The authors avoid open-chain hamstring exercises (eg, heel slides) to prevent unopposed hamstring activation, which may accentuate posterior sag of the tibia, contribute to joint irritation, and delay recovery.</p><p>Supervision by a knowledgeable physical therapist, athletic trainer, or comparable professional during this early stage of recovery is not mandatory but can be helpful to ensure that pain and swelling (if present) are manageable and the prescribed exercises are being performed correctly. Modalities often available through physical therapy, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, can help with quadriceps activation even if the patient is unable to perform simple open-chain exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>During rehabilitation, some patients may benefit from additional support of the posterior knee, which can be provided by the taping method pictured in the following graphic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100204\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100204 \">picture 3</a>). Note that the support provided by this method would <strong>not</strong> be adequate for a patient returning to full sport. Ideally, such patients should have developed sufficient strength of the muscles supporting the knee that extraneous support is unnecessary, or barring that should use a robust functional PCL brace.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413221\"><span class=\"h2\">Later rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advanced stage of rehabilitation typically commences four to six weeks after the initial injury, when pain and disability have subsided. Although several rehabilitation protocols for surgically treated PCL injuries have been published, there is relatively little evidence available to guide the rehabilitation of PCL injuries managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/3,10,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,40-42</a>]. An example of a properly designed, nonoperative PCL rehabilitation protocol for an isolated, uncomplicated, acute PCL injury can be found in the attached table and reference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103862 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Initially, the goals of this stage of rehabilitation are to continue to protect the knee, regain full knee motion, and strengthen the muscles primarily responsible for supporting the PCL-deficient knee (ie, quadriceps). Depending on patient goals, more challenging exercises are gradually introduced that enable the patient ultimately to regain full function.</p><p>Typically, rehabilitation for PCL injuries takes longer than that for ACL injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Rehabilitation protocols following PCL reconstruction range from 26 to 52 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44</a>], whereas rehabilitation of the nonoperatively treated PCL deficient knee is typically completed in half that time. It is important to note that rehabilitation protocols are function-based and not time-based.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413232\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions concerning return to sport or heavy labor are necessarily multi-factorial and entail balancing patient preference, subjective assessments of persistent pain and functional limitations, and objective evaluations of strength and performance. There is no single &quot;gold standard&quot; for determining return to sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The authors make their determination in concert with the physical therapists who have been conducting the patient's rehabilitation. The athlete is expected to demonstrate symmetric strength and proprioception in the affected and the uninvolved extremities. Strength can be assessed with single leg presses using resistance machines; proprioception may be determined by standing on one leg and maintaining balance and a level pelvis for 30 seconds. Plyometric and other functional tests are commonly used by physical therapists for these assessments, especially in athletes, and these may include timed single-leg hops for distance, shuttle runs, single leg vertical jumps for height, and the Star Excursion Balance Test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As a general rule of thumb, performance of the injured leg should be within ten percent of that of the uninjured leg prior to return to sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>For patients who do desk work or do not engage in vigorous activity, return to work can typically be achieved as soon as pain and functional disability have abated sufficiently. The time needed for a return to this sort of work is generally within two to four weeks, and can commence while the patient is still undergoing rehabilitation.</p><p>Beyond the period of early rehabilitation, there is no evidence to support functional knee bracing in patients with isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. When returning patients to sport, the authors do not routinely use functional knee braces, although these may be used for activities that are considered high-risk (eg, American football linemen). Following surgical reconstruction, such knee bracing may be used during sport for up to 18 months post-operatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413238\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of isolated, nonoperatively treated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears continues to be a source of debate. Some authors believe that the natural history of PCL tears entails inevitable degenerative changes and have argued that this supports the need for surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Others have noted that the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis after PCL reconstruction appears to be similar or worse than that seen in knees treated conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to determine the true prognosis or the best approach to treatment.</p><p>Based on limited evidence, it appears that most patients can expect to have good subjective and functional results with nonoperative management of isolated PCL tears. One prospective study of 133 patients reported that the majority had good subjective results at five year follow-up, with half able to return to sport at the same or a higher level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Smaller studies of similar design report comparable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>]. However, premature osteoarthritis is a long-term concern, as it is with any internal derangement of the knee. According to a case series of 44 patients managed nonoperatively and followed for a mean of 14.3 years, the prevalence of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis was 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>No factors have been identified that accurately predict which patients will develop complications, such as osteoarthritis, instability, or chronic pain. As an example, the grade of PCL injury does not correlate with the development of degenerative joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Historically, the results of surgical repair of isolated PCL injuries have been less satisfactory than comparable repairs of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, the PCL has greater natural healing ability than the ACL, with one study demonstrating continuity of the disrupted PCL in 20 of 21 patients six months after injury with conservative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, PCL repair and reconstruction are becoming more common, although high-quality evidence pertaining to the surgical treatment of isolated PCL injuries is lacking, and controversy exists about appropriate management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/35,46,48,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,46,48,52</a>]. The sources of controversy encompass a number of issues related to PCL surgery, including: repair versus reconstruction; single-bundle versus double-bundle reconstruction techniques; preferred graft options (eg, Achilles allograft versus hamstring autograft); whether any PCL remnant should be preserved in reconstruction; and the best surgical approach (eg, tibial tunnel versus tibial inlay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In the United States, many if not most Grade 3 injuries are currently managed nonoperatively, with surgery primarily reserved for acute, multi-ligamentous knee injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9413244\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the largest and strongest of the intra-articular ligaments of the knee, and the primary restraint to posterior translation of the tibia at the knee joint. PCL injuries are usually sustained from high-energy trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision [MVC]) in association with damage to other knee structures. Sporting activities are the second most common cause of PCL injury. Isolated PCL injuries are relatively uncommon, and athletes with such injuries may continue to function at a high level. (See <a href=\"#H9413038\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9413044\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-energy mechanisms of PCL injury typically involve a posteriorly directed sheer force is applied to a flexed knee, as might occur when a knee strikes a dashboard during a MVC. PCL injuries sustained during athletics typically occur when an athlete falls on their flexed knee while the foot is plantarflexed or from a direct blow to the anterior knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presentation of patients with a PCL injury varies depending upon the nature of the trauma and associated injuries and comorbidities. PCL injuries sustained from high-energy trauma are frequently associated with damage to the posterolateral corner (PLC), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), or a combination of these structures. The possibility of a complete knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation, a limb-threatening injury, must be considered for any patient complaining of knee pain or dysfunction following high-energy trauma. (See <a href=\"#H9413056\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCL injuries sustained from low-energy trauma (eg, sporting injuries) may present with gross instability, particularly if associated with injuries to posterolateral knee structures, but typically present with more subtle symptoms, particularly in the case of an isolated PCL injury. Patients with such injuries may present with a mild to moderate knee effusion, a slight limp, pain in the back of the knee (especially with squatting or kneeling), and loss of terminal knee flexion (final 10 to 20 degrees). Patients suffering from a chronically injured PCL-deficient knee present more often with generalized anterior knee pain that may localize to the medial compartment or patellofemoral joint. (See <a href=\"#H9413056\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following major trauma, the knee examination may be limited by pain, swelling, or the need to perform more urgent interventions. Gross instability due to multiple ligament disruptions (eg, knee dislocation) can damage the popliteal artery, putting the limb at risk, and this must be assessed. For patients assessed following low-energy trauma or with chronic complaints, it is important to perform a careful knee examination paying close attention to joint stability and function. Findings with an acute PCL injury often include gait abnormalities, a knee joint effusion, tenderness in the posterior fossa, and loss of terminal knee flexion. The most useful tests for detecting PCL injury are the posterior drawer test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74928\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74928 \">figure 4</a>), posterior sag sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93332 \">picture 2</a>), and quadriceps active test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104667\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104667 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103924 \">figure 5</a>). Given the frequency of injury to other knee ligaments in patients with PCL damage, the stability of the anterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments should be assessed. (See <a href=\"#H9413062\" class=\"local\">'Examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With any acute knee injury presenting after moderate or severe trauma in which a PCL injury is suspected and that is accompanied by concerning physical findings, such as joint effusion, focal bony tenderness, decreased range of motion, or limp, we suggest obtaining plain radiographs of the knee as part of the initial diagnostic imaging. If trauma is relatively minor and concerning physical findings are absent, the Ottawa knee rules can be used to guide decisions about plain radiographs. The Ottawa knee rules are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H1700819050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest obtaining an MRI for all patients in whom a PCL injury is suspected on clinical grounds (eg, blow to flexed knee with positive posterior drawer test) following acute trauma involving the knee. In addition, for patients with a chronic PCL injury suspected on clinical grounds and unrevealing plain radiographs, we suggest obtaining an MRI. MRI is the preferred method for establishing a definitive diagnosis in the acute or subacute setting, but its accuracy is more limited with chronic PCL injuries. (See <a href=\"#H68877236\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9413117\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCL injuries that meet any of the following criterial should be referred to a knowledgeable orthopedic surgeon:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 3 PCL injuries: Anterior border of medial tibial plateau can be displaced posteriorly beyond the anterior border of the medial femoral condyle (posterior displacement &gt;10 mm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PCL injuries associated with any fracture or any additional soft tissue injuries of significance (eg, injury of the PLC, ACL, or meniscus)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PCL disruption involving avulsion of the ligamentous insertion at the tibia (see <a href=\"#H9413141\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consult or referral'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating the patient with a possible PCL injury, other conditions to consider include: ACL injury, PLC and LCL injury, meniscal injury, proximal tibia fracture, knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation, bone contusion, and patellar and quadriceps tendon tear. (See <a href=\"#H9413147\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment of a PCL injury involves standard management of pain and functional disability, if present. The basic principles of protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and medications (PRICE-M) apply. Knee injuries involving multiple structures are referred as detailed above, but the management of isolated PCL injuries consists primarily of a progressive physical therapy program, which is discussed in the text. For isolated acute PCL injuries, we suggest maintaining the affected knee in full extension for approximately two weeks initially in order to reduce posterior lag.
