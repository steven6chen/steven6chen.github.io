In the subgroup of 322 patients with hemorrhagic stroke, IPC was associated with reduced risk of proximal DVT at 30 days (6.7 versus 17 percent; OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.75). In the total patient group (hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke), IPC was also associated with a reduction in the rate of proximal DVT (8.5 versus 12.1 percent), as well as lower rates of symptomatic DVT (proximal or calf) and any DVT (symptomatic or asymptomatic, proximal or calf). No major adverse events were associated with IPC, but IPC was associated with a higher rate of skin breaks (3.1 versus 1.4 percent). <br/><br/>In a randomized trial that compared the use of elastic stockings with or without IPC in 133 acute ICH patients, IPC was associated with reduced incidence of asymptomatic DVT on compression ultrasonography on day 10 (16 versus 5 percent, relative risk 0.29, 95% CI 0.08-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Rates of symptomatic DVT were low and similar in both groups. <br/><br/>There are several types of intermittent pneumatic compression devices (eg, multichamber versus monochamber, pressure applied sequentially or uniformly, whole leg versus calf only).

Both randomized trials cited above used multichamber devices that used sequential pressure applied to the entire leg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticoagulants </strong>&mdash; Very few studies have studied the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulation after a prior episode of ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/16,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24-26</a>]. A meta-analysis of four studies, two randomized, that compared anticoagulation therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, low-molecular-weight heparin, heparinoids) with other treatments in patients with acute ICH found that anticoagulation therapy was associated with a significant reduction in PE (1.7 versus 2.9 percent); while rates of DVT and mortality were nonsignificantly decreased, and rates of hematoma expansion were nonsignificantly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Extrapolating from patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is likely that anticoagulant therapies reduce the incidence of VTE in patients with an acute ICH. However, the safety of these agents in a setting of acute ICH has yet to be adequately established, and the absolute benefit for VTE prevention is likely to be low if IPC prophylaxis is properly used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association Stroke Council guideline has recommended that after documentation of cessation of bleeding, low-dose LMW or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> may be considered in patients at high risk (mostly bed bound) as early as the first day after ICH onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In choosing whether to start anticoagulant therapy, we also consider the risk of hematoma expansion (eg, presence of SPOT sign, blood pressure control, presenting hematoma volume).<br/><br/>Specific regimens for anticoagulant therapy for this indication are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-acutely-ill-hospitalized-medical-adults#H79882310\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are neither good data nor expert consensus about the optimal treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. </p><p>One review estimated the risk of fatal PE in patients with acute ICH to be about 25 percent for those who were untreated for proximal DVT or nonfatal PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Anticoagulant therapies are highly efficacious for reducing fatal and nonfatal PE in nonstroke patients with proximal DVT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As discussed above, DVT and PE are most likely to occur after the period of highest risk of hematoma expansion. While the risks of worsening or recurrence of an ICH with anticoagulation therapy during this relatively subacute period are not fully known it has been estimated to be approximately 3 to 5 percent, ie substantially less than the risk of fatal PE. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Risk of hemorrhage recurrence'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>These constructs, while not confirmed by clinical studies, favor the use of anticoagulation in this setting. As a result, in patients with acute ICH and proximal DVT or nonfatal PE and who are &gt;4 days from ICH onset, we recommend treatment with heparin, LMW heparin, or heparinoid, followed by the use of reduced intensity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation (ie, a target INR of 2.0) or low-molecular weight heparin for a period of three months. For ICH patients with DVT confined to below the knee, withholding anticoagulation is reasonable, providing cardiorespiratory reserve is adequate and serial monitoring to detect proximal extension of the thrombosis can be carried out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in this situation has been recommended by some authorities, including the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,33</a>], there are no direct comparisons between these two options (ie, anticoagulation versus IVC filter). The higher rate of long-term complications and lesser efficacy of IVC filters may therefore support the use of anticoagulants for patients who are more than one week from ICH onset or when IVC placement is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIOR OR RECENT INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs in ICH survivors involves a challenging <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> decision that considers the risk of late hemorrhage expansion and hemorrhage recurrence as well as the risk of thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].</p><p>Only those ICH survivors with an exceptionally high risk for atherothrombotic events should be treated with antiplatelet drugs, and only those with very high risk for cardioembolic stroke (ie, prosthetic valves, dilated cardiomyopathy, documented intracardiac thrombus) should be treated with anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Regardless of whether or not the patient is treated with antithrombotic agents, control of hypertension substantially reduces the risk of recurrent ICH. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of hemorrhage recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ICH recurs in survivors at a rate of 2 to 3 percent per year; this represents an approximate 10-fold increase in relative risk and a 2 percent per year absolute risk increase over the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. </p><p>During the first three months following an acute ICH, the reported rate of recurrent ICH, in the absence of anticoagulation, is about 1 percent (range 0.4 to 3.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/8,39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,39,42</a>].
