This topic reviews the conditions that a clinician is likely to encounter on routine physical examination. The most common nonacute scrotal conditions include varicocele, hydrocele, epididymal cyst and spermatocele, testicular cancer, chronic epididymitis, and cryptorchidism.</p><p>Acute scrotal pain in adults and scrotal disorders in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of scrotal pain or swelling in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The testis, tunica vaginalis, epididymis, spermatic cord, appendix testis, and appendix epididymis are anatomic structures that may be involved in nonacute scrotal conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The testis (testicle) is the male gonad responsible for production of sperm and androgens (primarily testosterone). The normal testis is ovoid, about 3 to 5 cm in length, and firm with smooth surfaces. One testis may be slightly larger than the other, and one testis (usually the left) may hang slightly lower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tunica vaginalis is a fascial layer which encapsulates a potential space that encompasses the anterior two-thirds of the testis. Different types of fluid may accumulate within the tunica vaginalis (eg, water with a hydrocele, blood with a hematocele, pus with a pyocele).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epididymis is a tightly coiled tubular structure located on the posterior aspect of the testis running from its superior to inferior poles. Sperm travels from the tubules of the rete testis into the epididymis, which joins the vas deferens distally. The function of the epididymis is to aid in the storage and transport of sperm cells that are produced in the testes, as well as to facilitate sperm maturation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spermatic cord, which consists of the testicular blood vessels and the vas deferens, is connected to the base of the epididymis and traverses into the retropubic space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appendix testis is a small vestigial structure on the anterosuperior aspect of the testis, representing an embryologic remnant of the M&uuml;llerian duct system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67439\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67439 \">figure 2</a>). It measures approximately 0.3 cm in length and is predisposed to torsion (twisting), particularly during childhood, because of its pedunculated shape. The appendix epididymis is a Wolffian duct vestigial structure found on the top of the epididymis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791714205\"><span class=\"h1\">PALPABLE ABNORMALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1490446302\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal scrotal findings are generally asymptomatic and may be identified by the patient on self-exam. The specific diagnosis is often based on characteristic physical findings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scrotal fullness, which is variable in size and has the feel of a &ldquo;bag of worms,&rdquo; is suggestive of a varicocele. It may be asymptomatic or associated with dull, aching scrotal pain. Varicoceles generally occur on the left side. (See <a href=\"#H196748973\" class=\"local\">'Varicocele'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral or bilateral diffuse scrotal swelling, which has a uniform consistency, is suggestive of a hydrocele. A small hydrocele is often asymptomatic, whereas a large one may be associated with significant pain. (See <a href=\"#H2795396049\" class=\"local\">'Hydrocele'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized fullness in the head of the epididymis is suggestive of an epididymal cyst or spermatocele (epididymal cyst &gt;2 cm). It is usually asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H2895775251\" class=\"local\">'Epididymal cyst/spermatocele'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A firm, nontender nodule or mass on a testis is suggestive of testicular cancer. It is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with gynecomastia. (See <a href=\"#H1525206540\" class=\"local\">'Testicular cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Transillumination of the scrotum may be helpful in identifying a hydrocele. It is performed by holding a light behind the scrotum: A hydrocele will permit the light to shine through, while solid lesions will block the light. However, it is important to emphasize that acute inflammatory conditions of the scrotal contents (epididymitis, torsion, appendiceal torsion) and testicular cancer may occasionally cause a reactive hydrocele.</p><p>If the specific diagnosis is not evident on physical examination, a scrotal ultrasound should be performed. It is a reliable means of distinguishing between these scrotal conditions, with &gt;95 percent sensitivity and specificity for intratesticular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The main role of ultrasound is to distinguish between intratesticular and extratesticular lesions: Most extratesticular lesions are benign, and intratesticular lesions are more likely to be malignant. Referral to a urologist is advised if there is still uncertainty after the ultrasound results, if testicular cancer is a possibility, or if surgery for a varicocele or hydrocele is a consideration. (See <a href=\"#H4252984257\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2795396049\" class=\"local\">'Hydrocele'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2246289456\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196748973\"><span class=\"h3\">Varicocele</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A varicocele, which is present in 15 to 20 percent of post-pubertal males, is caused by dilatation of the pampiniform plexus of spermatic veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73206 \">figure 3</a>). It is generally left-sided, first appears at puberty, and may become larger over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The left internal spermatic (gonadal) vein is one of the longest veins in the body, entering the left renal vein at a perpendicular angle. The intravascular pressure in the left renal vein is higher than on the right because it is compressed between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery coming off the aorta above the renal vein, thereby producing a &quot;nutcracker effect.&quot; This phenomenon causes increased pressure in the left gonadal vein, which can dilate and cause incompetence of the valve leaflets, leading to retrograde flow of blood toward the testis, resulting in dilation of the scrotal venous complex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2075621805\"><span class=\"h4\">Clinical features and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Varicocele is diagnosed by its characteristic physical findings, which range from minimal left-sided scrotal fullness on Valsalva maneuver to a large, soft, left-sided scrotal mass (&quot;bag of worms&quot;) that decompresses and disappears in the recumbent position. Varicoceles are graded I, II, or III according to size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51251 \">table 1</a>). If there is uncertainty, a scrotal ultrasound can be performed for confirmation.</p><p>Varicocele may be asymptomatic or present with any or all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dull, aching, usually left-sided scrotal pain, typically noticeable when standing and relieved by recumbency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophy of the left testicle, believed to be secondary to loss of germ cell mass by induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) initiated by slightly increased scrotal temperature</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased fertility</p><p/><p>Varicocele usually occurs in the left hemiscrotum. Bilateral varicoceles occur in 33 percent of patients. Unilateral right varicoceles are uncommon and should alert the clinician to possible underlying pathology causing inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction (eg, renal cell carcinoma with IVC thrombus, right renal vein thrombosis with clot propagation down the IVC) since the right gonadal vein directly empties into the IVC. We evaluate unilateral right varicoceles with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast. Varicoceles on either side that do not decompress in the recumbent position (non-diminishing) also raise concern for obstruction (eg, from thrombus or extrinsic masses) and should be evaluated by CT scan of the abdomen as well.</p><p>Varicoceles are often identified in infertile men. In a World Health Organization (WHO) study of over 9000 men who were partners in an infertile couple, a varicocele was much more common in men with abnormal semen (25.4 versus 11.7 percent with normal semen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A varicocele is more commonly found in men with secondary infertility because of its detrimental impact on semen parameters over time. On the other hand, men with varicoceles may have normal semen parameters and fertility. Thus, the precise relationship between varicocele and infertility is unknown because teenage boys may not feel comfortable providing a semen specimen for analysis and many infertility problems are multifactorial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary hypogonadism in males&quot;, section on 'Varicocele'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4252984257\"><span class=\"h4\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most varicoceles do not require intervention. Adolescents and young men who have a varicocele and objective evidence of reduced ipsilateral testicular size may be offered varicocele repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Treatment options include surgical ligation or percutaneous venous embolization. Low microsurgical approaches have lower recurrence and complication rates than high non-microsurgical approaches. Although data are limited and of low quality, some studies have shown improvement in semen parameters (over three to six months) and fertility after repair of varicocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Young men (21 years old or younger)</strong> &ndash; Young men with a varicocele should be evaluated for testicular atrophy on physical examination, and those who are post-pubertal should undergo a semen analysis if acceptable to the patient. Further management depends on those results:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>If there is evidence of testicular atrophy or abnormal semen parameters</strong> &ndash; We suggest surgical ligation or percutaneous venous embolization. There are data to suggest that catch-up growth of the atrophic testis is possible in some cases after surgery and that return of testicular size directly correlates with normal fertility potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Subclinical varicoceles are sometimes discovered as part of an infertility evaluation by demonstrating retrograde flow to the scrotum by color Doppler ultrasonography. Surgery or venous embolization is not recommended in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>If semen parameters are normal </strong>&ndash; We suggest monitoring with semen analysis every one to two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management of children and adolescents with a varicocele is discussed separately.

Conservative management with scrotal support and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may suffice for an older man who has completed his family and presents with minor scrotal discomfort as his only symptom.</p><p/><p>Surgery, which is the preferred treatment option for varicoceles, involves ligating the gonadal vein so that retrograde blood flow can no longer reach the plexus of veins in the scrotum. This procedure can be performed with inguinal, subinguinal, or retroperitoneal approaches. Some urologists favor laparoscopy or microsurgery, which may have a lower recurrence rate. Treatment with percutaneous gonadal vein embolization, with or without sclerotherapy, is an alternative to surgery, but there have been reports of embolization coils migrating to the lungs and other organs and higher overall recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is usually performed by accessing the left renal and then gonadal vein via the right common iliac vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Unilateral right varicoceles and varicoceles that do not decompress should be evaluated with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H2075621805\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2795396049\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrocele</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hydrocele is a collection of peritoneal fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis, which directly surrounds the testis and spermatic cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58679 \">figure 4</a>). It is the same layer that forms the peritoneal lining of the abdomen. Hydroceles are believed to arise from an imbalance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid from the tunica vaginalis.</p><p>Idiopathic hydrocele, the most common type, generally arises over a long period of time. Inflammatory conditions of the scrotal contents (epididymitis, torsion, appendiceal torsion) can produce an acute reactive hydrocele, which often resolves with treatment of the underlying condition.</p><p>Hydroceles range in size from small, soft collections that still allow palpation of the scrotal contents to massive, tense collections of several liters that make examination impossible. Pain and disability generally correlate with the size. Hydrocele fluid in the scrotal sac transilluminates well, which differentiates the process from a possible hematocele, hernia, or solid mass. A scrotal ultrasound should be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain since a reactive hydrocele can occur in the presence of a testicular neoplasm or with acute inflammatory scrotal conditions (eg, orchitis, epididymitis).</p><p>Most hydroceles do not require intervention. Treatment is only indicated in patients who are symptomatic with pain or a pressure sensation or when the scrotal skin integrity is compromised from chronic irritation. For asymptomatic patients with hydroceles, there is no need for routine follow-up.</p><p>The most common surgical procedure is excision of the hydrocele sac. Simple aspiration is generally unsuccessful because of the rapid reaccumulation of fluid but may be effective if combined with instillation of a sclerosing agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, alcohol) into the sac. The potential risks of this approach are a low incidence of reactive <span class=\"nowrap\">orchitis/epididymitis</span> and a higher rate of recurrence, which may then make open surgery more difficult because of the development of adhesions between the hydrocele sac and the scrotal contents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2895775251\"><span class=\"h3\">Epididymal cyst/spermatocele</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An epididymal cyst is generally asymptomatic and palpated as a soft round mass in the head of the epididymis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>). An epididymal cyst that is larger than 2 cm is called a spermatocele. Epididymal cysts occur with increased frequency in male offspring of mothers who used diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy. They do not generally require treatment, but spermatoceles may rarely necessitate surgical excision because of chronic pain.</p><p>The main differential diagnosis of an epididymal cyst is epididymal cystadenoma, which is palpated as a firm mass and can be distinguished from a cyst by scrotal ultrasound. It is often bilateral and seen in more than one-half of patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis and broad ligament'</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1525206540\"><span class=\"h3\">Testicular cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular cancer, while relatively rare, is the most common solid tumor in men between the ages of 18 and 40 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>). It usually presents as a painless mass discovered by the patient or clinician, although rapidly growing germ cell tumors may cause scrotal pain from hemorrhage and infarction. On physical examination, testicular cancer is usually a firm, nontender nodule or mass that does not transilluminate (although a reactive hydrocele may occasionally be evident). Some patients have associated gynecomastia.</p><p>Scrotal ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate a testicular nodule or mass. However, several conditions may mimic neoplasia on ultrasound, including inflammation, hematoma, infarct, fibrosis, and tubular ectasia. In cases in which the ultrasound is inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help differentiate benign from malignant lesions. In a study of 622 patients who underwent scrotal ultrasound to evaluate a variety of scrotal diseases, of whom 17 had a lesion suspicious for cancer but an inconclusive ultrasound, no lesion defined as benign by MRI proved to be malignant (negative predictive value 100 percent), while two benign inflammatory lesions were mistakenly thought to be malignant (positive predictive value 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These findings suggest that ultrasound is sufficient in the vast majority of patients with suspected malignancy but that MRI is a useful adjunct when ultrasound is equivocal or shows microcalcifications within the testis but no obvious mass. Small benign calcifications on the surface of the testis are relatively common and do not require further evaluation.</p><p>Any patient suspected of having testicular cancer should also have blood levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) measured. However, normal serum values do not exclude testicular cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of testicular cancer is described separately.

Several factors, including sexual activity, heavy physical exertion, and bicycle or motorcycle riding may predispose to it. Patients who present with chronic or recurrent epididymitis should be evaluated for a structural abnormality of the urinary tract by CT scan with contrast and possibly prostate ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Physical examination shows subtle epididymal induration and tenderness with or without swelling. In all suspected cases, a urinalysis, urine culture, and urine nucleic acid amplification tests for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> should be performed. Management is identical to that of acute infectious epididymitis but may rarely extend to surgical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults#H2745746919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic noninfectious epididymitis</strong> &ndash; Chronic noninfectious epididymitis can be precipitated by trauma, autoimmune disease, or vasculitis, but no etiology is identified in many cases. Idiopathic noninfectious epididymitis is thought to be the result of reflux of urine through the ejaculatory ducts and vas deferens into the epididymis, producing a &ldquo;chemical&rdquo; inflammation with resultant swelling and ductal obstruction. It can occur, however, even in men who have had a previous vasectomy. Typical inciting factors include prolonged periods of sitting (eg, long plane or car travel, sedentary desk jobs) or vigorous exercise (eg, heavy lifting). Unlike acute infectious epididymitis, patients have less pain and swelling on physical examination. The diagnosis is made by lack of response to empiric antibiotic therapy. Management includes scrotal elevation, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and avoidance of activities that precipitate symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYPTORCHIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryptorchidism is failure of descent of the testes into the scrotum during fetal development. This defect may result in the testes being located within the abdomen or inguinal canal or in another ectopic location. Both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism are associated with impaired spermatogenesis and an increased risk of testicular cancer, the reasons for which are poorly understood. It may have to do with dysregulation of growth factor expression that alters the balance between spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, which shifts them towards neoplastic proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Physical examination of adults with a suspected undescended testicle should be performed in both the standing and supine positions with adequate cremasteric relaxation to differentiate undescended testicle or ectopic testes from retractile testes. A true undescended testicle may sometimes be felt along the spermatic cord in the supine position.</p><p>The vast majority of cryptorchid testes are addressed during childhood, and their management is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H169948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Management of undescended testes'</a>).

If the specific diagnosis is not evident on physical examination, a scrotal ultrasound should be performed. Referral to a urologist is advised if there is still uncertainty after the ultrasound results, if testicular cancer is a possibility, or if surgery for a varicocele or hydrocele is a consideration. (See <a href=\"#H1490446302\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varicoceles present with left-sided scrotal fullness, which is variable in size and has the feel of a &ldquo;bag of worms.&rdquo; They may be asymptomatic or associated with dull, aching scrotal pain. Unilateral right varicoceles are uncommon and should alert the clinician to possible underlying pathology. We evaluate unilateral right varicoceles with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen. Varicoceles on either side that do not decompress in the recumbent position (non-diminishing) also raise concern for obstruction and should be evaluated by CT scan as well. (See <a href=\"#H2075621805\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most varicoceles do not require intervention. We suggest surgical ligation or percutaneous venous embolization in men &le;21 years old if the varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy or decreased sperm quality (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In young men with normal semen parameters, we suggest monitoring with semen analysis every one to two years. Older men with varicoceles who have normal semen parameters can be followed with semen analysis every two years for as long as fertility is desired. (See <a href=\"#H4252984257\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydroceles present with unilateral or bilateral diffuse scrotal swelling, which has a uniform consistency. A small hydrocele is often asymptomatic, whereas a large one may be associated with significant pain. Most hydroceles do not require intervention. However, we suggest treatment in patients who are symptomatic with pain or a pressure sensation or when the scrotal skin integrity is compromised from chronic irritation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The most common surgical procedure is excision of the hydrocele sac. Simple aspiration is generally unsuccessful because of the rapid reaccumulation of fluid. (See <a href=\"#H2795396049\" class=\"local\">'Hydrocele'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epididymal cysts and spermatoceles (epididymal cyst &gt;2 cm) present with localized fullness in the head of the epididymis and are usually asymptomatic. Epididymal cysts do not generally require treatment, but spermatoceles may rarely warrant surgical excision because of chronic pain. (See <a href=\"#H2895775251\" class=\"local\">'Epididymal cyst/spermatocele'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular cancer presents as a firm, nontender nodule on a testis. It is usually asymptomatic but is occasionally associated with gynecomastia. Patients with testicular nodules or masses should undergo scrotal ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful adjunct when ultrasound is equivocal or shows microcalcifications within the testis but no obvious mass. Any patient suspected of having testicular cancer should also have blood levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) measured. (See <a href=\"#H1490446302\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1525206540\" class=\"local\">'Testicular cancer'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic epididymitis may be infectious or noninfectious in origin. It presents with localized tenderness and swelling on the posterior aspect of the testis (usually without lower urinary tract symptoms). Management of chronic infectious epididymitis is identical to that of acute infectious epididymitis. For the management of chronic noninfectious epididymitis, we suggest scrotal elevation, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and avoidance of activities that precipitate symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3389120289\" class=\"local\">'Chronic epididymitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryptorchidism is failure of descent of the testes into the scrotum during fetal development. Both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism are associated with impaired spermatogenesis and an increased risk of testicular cancer. The vast majority of cryptorchid testes are addressed during childhood. If an undescended testis is detected in men &lt;50, we suggest surgical excision to prevent the development of testicular cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cryptorchidism'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rifkin MD, Kurtz AB, Pasto ME, Goldberg BB.
