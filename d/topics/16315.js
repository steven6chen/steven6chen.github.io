In addition, patients with ascites admitted to the hospital for other reasons should also undergo paracentesis to look for evidence of SBP. A low clinical suspicion for SBP does <strong>not</strong> obviate the need for testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Paracentesis can be performed in the interventional radiology suite or at the bedside. It is important that trained personnel be available to perform the procedure at off hours (such as at night or on weekends). Paracentesis should be carried out promptly in patients with suspected SBP, as delays in performing paracentesis have been associated with increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Paracentesis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-and-therapeutic-abdominal-paracentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic and therapeutic abdominal paracentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of paracentesis was demonstrated in a review of a database of 17,711 patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of ascites or encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Paracentesis was performed in 61 percent. Patients who underwent paracentesis had a lower in-hospital mortality rate than those who did not undergo paracentesis (6.5 versus 8.5 percent; adjusted odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.74).</p><p>If SBP is suspected, a paracentesis should be performed with analysis of the ascitic fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75590\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef75590 \">algorithm 1</a>). It is important that the paracentesis be performed <strong>prior</strong> to the administration of any antibiotics. Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is crucial to ensure the proper tests are obtained, to minimize the risk of skin flora contaminating the cultures, and to avoid obtaining a falsely negative culture. Tests obtained on the fluid include aerobic and anaerobic cultures, cell count and differential, and fluid chemistries (albumin, protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and in some cases bilirubin). (See <a href=\"#H59507197\" class=\"local\">'Handling the ascitic fluid'</a> below.)</p><p>A diagnosis of SBP is made if the polymorphonuclear cell (PMN, also referred to as neutrophils) count in the ascitic fluid is &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> culture results are positive, and secondary causes of peritonitis are excluded. However, in selected cases, fluid chemistries may be needed to support the diagnosis. While awaiting the results of the fluid cultures, patients with a PMN count &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</span> </sup>should be started on empiric antibiotic treatment.

Prior to performing a paracentesis in a patient suspected of having SBP, it is important to have the equipment necessary not only to obtain the fluid, but also to send it for analysis (eg, blood culture bottles, purple- and red-top blood-drawing tubes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Paracentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is vital that patients suspected of having SBP undergo abdominal paracentesis <strong>before</strong> receiving any antibiotics (a single dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic can lead to no growth in 86 percent of patients after six hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the vast majority of patients, a paracentesis can be safely carried out despite an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). Paracentesis should not be delayed in patients suspected of having SBP. In a retrospective study of 239 hospitalized patients with SBP, mortality rates were higher for those who underwent paracentesis 12 to 72 hours after hospitalization compared with those who underwent paracentesis within 12 hours of hospitalization (27 versus 13 percent; adjusted odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-4.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Each hour of delay in paracentesis was associated with a 3.3 percent increase in mortality.

Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is also required to minimize the risk of obtaining a falsely negative culture, possibly leading to the diagnosis of culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (ie, ascites with a PMN count &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> but with negative cultures of the ascitic fluid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, these tests will frequently fail to detect tuberculous peritonitis, so if there is high suspicion, peritoneoscopy with mycobacterial culture and histology of a biopsied tubercle are the most rapid route to the diagnosis.

At least two bottles (one for aerobic and one for anaerobic culture) should be inoculated immediately at the bedside using a new, sterile needle. A needle that has passed through the skin should <strong>not</strong> be used to inoculate the bottles because it may lead to contamination of the sample with skin flora. Ideally, at least 10 mL of fluid should be introduced into each bottle. </p><p>We use the following approach when obtaining ascitic fluid cultures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately prior to the paracentesis, we wipe the top of each blood culture bottle with an alcohol wipe and leave the wipe on the bottle top in an attempt to maintain sterility while the paracentesis is being performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the paracentesis, a 20 mL syringe is connected to the needle that is in the abdominal wall and filled with ascitic fluid. Additional syringes are filled to obtain fluid for additional testing (eg, cell count and chemistries), and if needed, to increase the volume of fluid obtained for culture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately after the paracentesis, a new, sterile needle should be placed on the 20 mL syringe. The new needle can be used to inoculate multiple bottles. However, each syringe should have its own new needle. This is to decrease the risk of a needle-stick injury that could occur if the needle is transferred among syringes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alcohol wipes are removed and the blood culture bottles are inoculated, preferably with at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid each. However, some bottles will not permit more than the recommended amount of fluid to be instilled without infringing upon the &quot;head space&quot; in the bottle, in which case the upper end of the recommended amount of fluid should be instilled. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If tuberculous peritonitis is suspected, ascitic fluid should be sent to the lab as per local procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blood culture bottles are sent to the microbiology laboratory immediately for both aerobic and anaerobic culture.</p><p/><p>It is important to use blood culture bottles because SBP is a low-colony-count monomicrobial infection similar to bacteremia. If a syringe or tube of fluid is sent to the laboratory for culture, the sensitivity for detecting SBP is dramatically decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Culturing ascitic fluid as if it were blood (with immediate bedside inoculation of ascitic fluid into blood culture bottles) has been shown to increase the culture-positivity of the ascitic fluid. In a study of patients with an ascitic fluid PMN count &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> (in the absence of prior antibiotic treatment, pancreatitis, tuberculous peritonitis, or malignancy-related ascites), immediate inoculation increased the sensitivity of cultures from about 50 to 77 percent (with delayed inoculation) to 80 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>].</p><p>The volume of fluid cultured also has a dramatic impact on the sensitivity of ascitic fluid cultures. In one report, for example, inoculation of 10 or 20 mL of fluid into 100 mL blood culture bottles led to a much higher culture-positivity rate than a 1 mL inoculum (93 versus 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59507460\"><span class=\"h3\">Gram stain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few milliliters of ascitic fluid should be sent for Gram stain in a sterile urine container or red-top tube. Centrifugation of the fluid prior to performing a Gram stain is not necessary since it does not increase the yield and may actually decrease the likelihood of obtaining a positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Fluid from the blood culture bottles can only be used for Gram stain after they have incubated for 12 to 24 hours, so sending a separate sample immediately after the paracentesis permits receiving the Gram stain results much more rapidly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 1 mL of fluid should be injected into a purple-top EDTA blood-drawing tube for cell count. An accurate cell count cannot be obtained if the fluid is allowed to clot or is submitted in a non-anticoagulated tube. The cell count and differential should be ordered &quot;stat,&quot; otherwise many laboratories will prioritize the cell count below routine peripheral blood counts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59507442\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemistries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several milliliters of fluid should be injected into a red-top blood-drawing tube for chemistries. Chemistries obtained should include albumin (so the serum-ascites albumin gradient can be determined), total protein concentration, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and amylase. If the fluid is dark orange or brown, a bilirubin concentration should be obtained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59507452\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF ASCITIC FLUID TEST RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is typically diagnosed if there is an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear cell (PMN, also referred to as neutrophils) count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture, and absence of secondary causes of peritonitis, such as bowel perforation. However, in some cases, additional tests may be needed to support the diagnosis or to differentiate SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59507681\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture and Gram stain results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of an elevated PMN count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> positive culture results from ascitic fluid not only confirm a diagnosis of SBP, but also allow for tailored antibiotic therapy. However, antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while awaiting culture results in patients with a PMN count &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span>. Instead, patients should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, with narrowing of the antibiotic coverage once a pathogen has been identified. Pathogens commonly associated with SBP included <em>Escherichia coli</em>, streptococcal species, and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80188 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology and bacterial entry into ascites'</a>.)</p><p>Gram stain is notoriously insensitive for detecting SBP and is associated with a high false-positive rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One study found that 16 of 31 positive Gram stains were false positives, and that only 1 Gram stain out of 796 led to a change in antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, a Gram stain can help differentiate SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis due to gut perforation. In the latter, the Gram stain may show multiple different bacterial forms. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Ascitic fluid analysis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59507564\"><span class=\"h2\">Ascitic fluid cell count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absolute PMN count in the ascitic fluid is calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell count (or total &quot;nucleated cell&quot; count) by the percentage of PMNs in the differential. The diagnosis of SBP is established by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture and an elevated ascitic fluid absolute PMN count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span>.</p><p>If the laboratory provides an &quot;expanded differential&quot; including bands or even earlier forms of PMNs, these should be added to the count of PMNs. The cell count and differential are performed manually, so the accuracy of the differential is dependent upon the skill of the medical technologist. Some investigators have found that automated cell counts can be accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, this has not been our experience; we have found that their accuracy is poor when the PMN count is low. Nevertheless, the automated approach has the potential to improve the speed with which results are obtained if it can be validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>One potential source of error in the PMN count is that hemorrhage into the ascitic fluid, as in a traumatic paracentesis, leads to red cell and white cell entry into the fluid. A corrected PMN count should be calculated if there is bloody fluid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One PMN is subtracted from the absolute PMN count for every 250 red <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</span> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p>PMNs lyse rapidly, much more so than red cells. Thus, if the bleeding episode occurred prior to (rather than during) paracentesis, the PMNs that entered the fluid may have lysed, and the corrected PMN count may be a negative number.</p><p>The results of the cell count should be reviewed and a decision made about treatment within a few hours of the paracentesis. Delaying empiric antibiotic treatment could result in the death of the patient from infection. It is prudent to write the initial antibiotic order to be given &quot;stat&quot; to prevent an inadvertent delay in administration of the first dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Use of dipsticks to detect PMNs could provide presumptive evidence of SBP in 90 to 120 seconds and is being studied. Use of dipsticks could lead to initiation of treatment within minutes rather than hours.

Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein concentration less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/dL)</span> have the lowest concentration of opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

The glucose concentration generally remains above 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in SBP but frequently falls below this level in secondary bacterial peritonitis. This difference may be related to the fact that patients with SBP typically have lower ascitic fluid PMN counts than patients with secondary bacterial peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the setting of gut perforation, the ascitic fluid glucose concentration may fall to near zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in ascitic fluid is released from PMNs that have lysed.

One study, for example, analyzed 22 patients whose ascitic fluid was examined before and then during an episode of SBP. The LDH concentration increased significantly during infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The upper limit of normal for LDH varies by laboratory.

Every segment of the gut, with the exception of the gallbladder, leaks amylase into the fluid when it perforates. In one report, two patients with pancreatic ascites had a mean ascitic fluid amylase concentration of 1957 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> a value more than five times that in the plasma. By contrast, the mean amylase concentration in patients with nonpancreatic ascites was 42 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> a value just under one-half of the plasma value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ascitic fluid bilirubin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated bilirubin concentration in the ascitic fluid suggests perforation of the gallbladder into the peritoneum (choleperitoneum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The bilirubin concentration should only be measured if the ascitic fluid is dark orange or brown.
