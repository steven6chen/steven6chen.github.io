Mild types of heart block can cause your heart to beat more slowly than normal or to skip beats. More serious types can cause your heart to stop beating. Without emergency treatment, serious heart block can be fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199727\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes heart block?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart block happens when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat either get slowed down or stopped. Most people with heart block get it from a disease, surgery, or medicine that damaged their heart. In rare cases, people are born with heart block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199744\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of heart block?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the type of heart block a person has. There are 3 types of heart block:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree &ndash; This is the mildest type of heart block. Often, people with this type have no symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree &ndash; This type is more serious than first degree. Symptoms include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fainting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling dizzy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree &ndash; This is the most serious type of heart block. It can cause the same symptoms as second degree, but they will be more severe. In some cases, third degree heart block can be life threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199759\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for heart block?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will probably do a test called an electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;). This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>You might also need other tests to see if another condition is causing your slow heartbeat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199774\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If you do not have these problems, but you often notice your heart beating slowly or skipping beats, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199789\"><span class=\"h1\">How is heart block treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the type of heart block you have. Often, people who have first degree heart block do not need treatment. But people who have third degree heart block and some people who have second degree heart block need a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a device that goes under the skin near a person's heart. It sends electrical signals to the heart that help it beat at a normal rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199804\"><span class=\"h1\">Can heart block be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have heart disease are more likely to get heart block. Doing things that keep your heart healthy can help prevent heart disease. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a healthy diet. This involves eating lots of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, but not a lot of meat or fatty foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking or doing a physical activity on most days of the week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7199821\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers-and-their-responses-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vagal maneuvers and their responses (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
