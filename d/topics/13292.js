They include pelvic ring fractures, acetabular fractures, and avulsion injuries. The majority of pelvis injuries are due to high energy blunt trauma, although frail and elderly patients may sustain such injuries from a low energy mechanism (ie, fall). High energy trauma increases the likelihood of concomitant injuries, likely involving the abdominal and pelvic viscera.</p><p>Bony pelvic injuries in adults will be reviewed here. Abdominal injuries and other aspects of trauma, including initial management, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic fractures represent approximately 3 percent of skeletal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall mortality from pelvic fractures ranges from 5 to 16 percent, with the rate for unstable pelvic fractures approximately 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Patients with pelvic fractures who are in shock at presentation have high mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mortality rate associated with acetabular fractures is 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while open pelvic fractures, which comprise 2 to 4 percent of all pelvic fractures, are associated with a mortality rate of up to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6-8</a>]. Most fatalities stem from associated internal injuries; deaths attributed solely to pelvic fractures range from 0.4 to 0.8 percent of trauma fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,9</a>]. Patients aged greater than 65 with pelvic fractures have a mortality rate of approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Overall, pelvic fractures are associated with an increased risk of death among trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>An Australian study of pelvic ring fractures demonstrated an incidence of 23 per 100,000 persons per year, while a British study found the incidence of acetabular fractures to be 3 per 100,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Reviews of two large trauma registries found the incidence of pelvic ring fractures among admitted trauma patients to be 8 and 9.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for pelvic fractures include low bone mass, smoking, hysterectomy, older age, and a propensity to fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Age greater than 60 years in patients with significant pelvic fractures predicts a higher likelihood of bleeding requiring angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common mechanisms for pelvic fractures include motor vehicle collisions and motorcycle accidents (43 to 58 percent), pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle (20 to 22 percent), and falls (5 to 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,19</a>]. Similar mechanisms lead to acetabular fractures, but the percentage caused by motor vehicle collisions and motorcycle accidents is higher (80.5 to 83.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. Avulsion fractures usually result from sudden, forceful contraction of a muscle in skeletally immature athletes aged 14 to 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>One study looking at 1851 motor vehicle accident patients, of whom 511 had pelvic fractures, found a higher incidence of pelvic fractures among those who sustained near side lateral impacts and reported that the use of seat belts was associated with fewer pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another study of 240 motor vehicle accident victims, 38 with pelvic ring fractures, also found an association with near side lateral impact crashes, but no decrease in pelvic ring injury with seat belt use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The effect of near side lateral impact on injury rates may change with the introduction of side torso airbags in automobiles, which occurred subsequent to the collection of much of the data used for these studies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvis injuries from high energy trauma frequently cause concomitant internal injuries, which may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; Life-threatening hemorrhage can occur, typically related to bleeding from the venous plexus (presacral, lumbar), but other sources of arterial or venous bleeding have been reported. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Venous plexus bleeding is the source in 80 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one case series, 38.5 percent of hospitalized trauma patients with pelvic fractures required transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another series, 34 percent of trauma patients with isolated pelvis and acetabulum fractures required blood transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although complex pelvic injuries with major ligament disruption more often require transfusion, hemorrhage can accompany any pelvic fracture pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Factors associated with hemorrhage requiring treatment with angiographic embolization include sacroiliac joint disruption, prolonged hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg), and female gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial bleeding associated with pelvic trauma can be related to injury of the iliac vessels (artery, veins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The mechanism of injury is compression of the vessels against the pelvic brim or shearing that disrupts the integrity of the vessel wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraabdominal</strong> &ndash; Such injury occurs in 16.5 percent of patients with pelvic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Both visceral organs (eg, liver, spleen) and bowel may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>].

Males are 10 times more likely to sustain urethral injuries (1.5 versus 0.15 percent).

The incidence increases with the degree of instability: 1.5 percent in stable fractures versus 14.4 percent in unstable fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The most common sites include the L5 and S1 nerve roots and isolated peripheral nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fracture types'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thoracic aorta rupture</strong> &ndash; Dissection of the thoracic aorta occurs in 1.4 percent of blunt trauma patients with a pelvic fracture, compared with 0.3 percent of all blunt trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Acetabular fractures, even in isolation, are associated with similar rates of concomitant injuries and require thorough evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bony pelvis consists of the sacrum, coccyx, and three innominate bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The ilium, ischium, and pubis fuse to form the acetabulum. The acetabulum is classically described as having an anterior column (anterior iliac wing, superior pubic ramus, and anterior wall of the acetabulum) and a posterior column (ischium, ischial tuberosity, and posterior wall of the acetabulum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76695\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76695 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The strength and stability of the pelvis relies on the strong ligaments connecting the sacrum with the other pelvic bones. These ligaments include the sacroiliac ligament complex (anterior and posterior portions), sacrospinous, and sacrotuberous. Additional pelvic strength comes from the symphyseal ligaments running from pubis to pubis, and ligaments between the lumbar spine and pelvic ring, such as the iliolumbar and lumbosacral. Disruption of these ligaments leads to pelvic instability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82199\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82199 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57811 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Within the bony pelvis lie the pelvic viscera, an extensive vascular system, and a rich neural network. The pelvis contains the rectum, anal canal, and bladder. In females, the urethra, uterus, ovaries, and vagina also lie within the pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66158\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66158 \">figure 4</a>). The prostate is found in males. All these structures require evaluation in pelvis injuries.</p><p>The pelvic arterial system has anatomic variability especially the internal iliac artery and its branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65019 \">figure 5</a>). Usually, the two common iliac arteries divide at the level of the pelvic brim. The external iliac artery follows the pelvic brim to exit the pelvis underneath the inguinal ligament. The internal iliac artery lies more posterior in the pelvis, particularly the posterior division as it overlies the sacroiliac joint. The posterior branch divides into the superior gluteal, iliolumbar, and lateral sacral arteries. The anterior division has many more branches; most important are the obturator and internal pudendal arteries, which can be injured in pubic rami fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73935 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>The pelvic venous system consists of veins that parallel the arterial system and a venous plexus that lies anterior to the sacrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59871\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59871 \">figure 7</a>). This plexus contains many thin-walled veins. This plexus is highly susceptible to damage with sacroiliac injuries and is a common source of bleeding.</p><p>The neural network in the pelvis, the lumbosacral plexus, arises primarily from the nerve roots of L4 to S3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74353 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56679 \">figure 8</a>). The sacral nerves exit through the sacral neural foramina and can be injured with sacral fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71171\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71171 \">figure 9</a>). Injuries to these nerves can result in bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73935 \">figure 6</a>). Although they do not arise from the lumbosacral plexus, the femoral and obturator nerves lie within the pelvis and may be injured with pelvic trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FRACTURE TYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic fractures include ring disruptions, sacral fractures, acetabular fractures, and avulsion injuries. Significant hemorrhage may accompany any fracture pattern. However, patients with stable fractures (no operative intervention required) and no other significant injuries who are hemodynamically stable at presentation seldom have major bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic ring disruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bony pelvis forms a ring. When the ring is broken, most often two fractures occur. Therefore, clinicians should examine radiographs closely for additional injuries whenever a pelvis fracture is identified. &#160; &#160;</p><p>The elderly and athletes represent two exceptions to the general principle of grouped pelvic fractures. The elderly can sustain isolated rami or sacral fractures due to minor trauma and osteopenia. In addition, isolated fractures are occasionally seen in low energy falls and straddle type injuries. Avulsion fractures from sudden, forceful contraction of a muscle may occur in skeletally immature athletes.</p><p>Several classification schemes for pelvic ring disruptions have been proposed. This review uses the Young and Burgess classification scheme because it incorporates the mechanism of injury and the direction of the involved forces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81214 \">figure 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55023 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>While Young and Burgess found a correlation between major ligamentous injury (lateral compression III, anteroposterior compression II and III) and an increased risk of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent correlation between injury type and mortality or the need for angiographic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. However, the largest review, involving 1248 pelvic fractures, reported that patients with unstable fracture patterns (lateral compression <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III,</span> anteroposterior compression <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III,</span> vertical shear) required twice the transfusion rate of patients with stable injuries (4.9 versus 2.4 units) and sustained increased mortality (11.5 versus 7.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. One prospective observational study found that sacroiliac joint disruption, regardless of the Young-Burgess classification, predicts the need for angiographic embolization (odds ratio [OR] 4.5; 95% CI 1.6-12.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Overall, evidence suggests that patients who sustain a major injury to the posterior pelvic ring are more likely to have complications.</p><p>The Young and Burgess classification is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lateral compression injuries</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 1 &ndash; Most common of this type.

This fracture encompasses an anterior injury (either widening of the pubic symphysis or rami fractures or both) and a posterior pelvic fracture or ligamentous injury. Lateral compression, anteroposterior compression, and vertical shear injuries may all be termed open-book based upon the extent of injury and anterior widening. When the anterior pelvic ring widens more than 2.5 cm, the posterior pelvis (especially the anterior portion of the sacroiliac ligamentous complex) is frequently injured, increasing the risk of hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Sacral fracture classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Denis and colleagues further classified sacral fractures to assist with predicting neurologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Sudden forceful muscular contraction is the usual cause. The most common sites and muscles involved are the anterior superior iliac spine (sartorius), anterior inferior iliac spine (rectus femoris), ischial tuberosity (hamstrings), and less commonly the lesser trochanter (iliopsoas) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54327\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54327 \">image 23</a>).

Prehospital trauma management is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In pelvic trauma, the primary goal of EMS personnel is recognizing possible injuries based upon mechanism and physical assessment. Unstable pelvic injuries, such as &quot;open-book&quot; fractures involving disruption of the sacroiliac joints, are associated with retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can be severe. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fracture types'</a> above.)</p><p>The results of a large, retrospective study involving over 7000 trauma patients with pelvic fracture raise important doubts about the accuracy of pre-hospital examination for detecting clinically unstable pelvic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Consequently, whether a pelvis injury is suspected or not in a hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patient, we suggest that paramedics stabilize or &quot;close&quot; the pelvis by securing it with a sheet or by applying a commercial pelvic binder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62544\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62544 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61466\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61466 \">picture 2</a>). This reduces pelvic volume and stabilizes fracture fragments, thereby reducing the risk of major hemorrhage. Paramedics can also tie the legs together to stabilize the lower extremities in internal rotation, which reduces pelvic volume. Care should be taken not to tie or bind the pelvis too tightly. The goal of pelvic binding is stabilization and existing injuries may be exacerbated by over-reduction. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Pelvis injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients sustain pelvis injuries from high energy trauma and have multiple injuries to be addressed. Often the condition of the trauma patient limits the clinician's ability to obtain a complete history. Prehospital providers can describe the likely mechanism of injury, accident scene (eg, intrusion into the passenger compartment of an automobile), and their initial assessment. In addition to the standard trauma history (eg, AMPLE: Allergies, Medications [especially anti-coagulants], Past history, Last meal, Events), the following facts are useful in the setting of possible pelvic trauma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism of injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulatory at the accident scene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel or bladder incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding: hematuria, rectal or vaginal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Last menstrual period</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial inspection should include a search for external bleeding, ecchymosis (flank, perineal, and scrotal), blood at the penile meatus, vaginal bleeding, and the position of the lower extremities and iliac crests. Do not neglect to inspect the back, gluteal region, and pannicular folds.</p><p>Palpation of bony landmarks, range of motion (if there is no obvious deformity or significant pain), and a thorough neurovascular examination should be performed. The important bony landmarks to palpate include the iliac crests, pubic symphysis, sacrum, sacroiliac joints, and greater trochanters.</p><p>Rectal and vaginal examinations should be carefully completed to assess for open fractures. These examinations should include evaluation for palpable bony fragments, integrity of the rectal and vaginal walls, gross blood, and a high riding prostate. Although the accuracy of the digital rectal examination is limited, assessing for open pelvic fractures represents one instance when it may provide useful information beyond clinical judgment in trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Care should be taken to avoid injury to the examiner from bony fragments. The rectal examination in trauma is reviewed in detail separately.

Once a pelvic injury is detected, repeated compression should be avoided. According to retrospective data, instability with compression of the pelvis has limited sensitivity for detecting a pelvic fracture (8 percent), including unstable pelvic fractures (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, when present, such instability is highly specific for both stable and unstable fractures (approximately 99 percent for each).</p><p>In awake trauma patients (Glasgow Coma Scale 14 or 15), the physical examination is highly sensitive for significant pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. In a prospective study comparing a focused examination protocol to CT scan, pain with palpation of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint had the greatest sensitivity (98 percent) for detecting posterior pelvic ring injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A study based upon prospectively collected data found that among patients with signs of blunt pelvic trauma, those who sustained pelvic fractures had more severe injuries overall and were more likely to be hypotensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The clinician should <strong>not</strong> rely upon the physical examination in severely injured or intubated trauma patients. In one prospective series, physical examination missed 20 percent of surgically significant pelvic fractures in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all trauma patients, stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation takes precedence.

Its role in the assessment of pelvic trauma has yet to be clearly defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of the hemoperitoneum in the setting of a pelvic fracture can be difficult, especially in the hemodynamically unstable patient. Two retrospective studies of the FAST examination in blunt trauma patients with pelvic fractures found the test's sensitivity to be 26 and 81 percent, respectively, with specificities of 96 and 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Although the accuracy of the FAST examination is limited in patients with pelvic fractures, its high specificity and bedside availability has led to its incorporation into pelvic management protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/19,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,49-51</a>]. However, further evaluation is needed whenever the examination is negative and either the patient is unstable or clinical suspicion for injury remains. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic peritoneal aspirate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic peritoneal aspirate (DPA) is used in patients with negative FAST studies and persistent hemodynamic instability to determine rapidly whether the source of bleeding is peritoneal or retroperitoneal. An aspirate of 10 mL or more of gross blood is considered positive for intraperitoneal bleeding. The role of DPA in the assessment of pelvic trauma is discussed below; the general role of DPA and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in abdominal trauma is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)'</a>.)</p><p>Although the role of DPA in pelvic trauma remains unclear, it may be an important tool for determining whether intraabdominal free fluid detected by ultrasound is blood or urine. This distinction can be of great importance in unstable patients with multiple trauma that includes pelvic injuries. In a single-center, retrospective study of 87 patients with major pelvis trauma, free peritoneal fluid detected by ultrasound was found to be urine rather than blood in 19 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A plain radiograph of the pelvis is obtained in hemodynamically unstable patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89080\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89080 \">image 24</a>); its utility in stable patients and those undergoing computed tomography is debatable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. We do <strong>not</strong> routinely obtain a plain radiograph in patients who meet <strong>all</strong> the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glasgow coma scale &gt;13</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No pelvic, abdominal, or back complaints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No tenderness in the lower abdomen, lower back, groin, or bony pelvis (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above)</p><p/><p>Traditional teaching in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) is to obtain a portable AP pelvis radiograph in all trauma patients suspected to have a pelvis injury on the basis of mechanism or physical findings. However, many clinicians question the utility of a plain radiograph in screening for pelvis fractures in hemodynamically stable blunt trauma patients. Several observational studies have found plain radiograph to have limited sensitivity and no effect upon management in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55,56</a>]. One important caveat to these studies is that all patients underwent multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans, which guided treatment. In hospitals without MDCT scanning and in hemodynamically unstable patients, portable pelvis radiographs should be performed. </p><p>The plain AP radiograph is used to assess for significant pelvic fractures, specifically displaced fractures, open-book injuries, and posterior pelvis injuries. Example radiographs for many pelvic injuries are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fracture types'</a> above.) </p><p>Remember that when the pelvic ring is broken most often two fractures occur, although this may not be the case in elder patients. Also keep in mind that passive recoil of the pelvis due to intact muscular attachments (ie, pelvic recoil) can make it difficult to appreciate the extent of pelvic fracture displacement and contribute to the limited sensitivity of plain pelvis radiographs. In a study of 15 cadavers with simulated pelvic trauma, pelvic recoil was reported to occur in approximately 40 percent of open-book injuries and 80 percent of lateral compression injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>The posterior stability of the pelvic ring is enhanced by the iliolumbar ligaments that connect the L5 transverse process to the iliac crest. Any fracture of this transverse process weakens the attachment. According to a retrospective case series, unstable pelvic fractures are approximately nine times more likely when an L5 transverse process fracture occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Once the patient has been stabilized and other injuries have been appropriately managed, specialized radiographs may be performed.

The iliac oblique highlights the posterior column and the anterior wall of the acetabulum while the obturator oblique illustrates the anterior column and the posterior wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50887\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50887 \">image 14</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69019\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69019 \">image 12</a>).

MDCT can determine concomitant injuries, areas of arterial bleeding, and the extent of retroperitoneal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Most hemodynamically stable blunt trauma patients with a pelvic fracture should be evaluated with MDCT. Notable exceptions include elderly patients with isolated pubic rami fractures and athletes with avulsion fractures. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Avulsion fractures'</a> above.) </p><p>MDCT has some limitations assessing rotational instability in patients wearing a pelvic binder. Specific avulsion type injuries to the inferolateral sacrum, ischial spines, and rectus abdominis insertion can act as markers, albeit uncommon ones, of rotational instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should have a low threshold for obtaining a CT when an acetabular injury is suspected.

Hemodynamically unstable patients with a positive FAST examination are treated with emergent celiotomy, pelvic stabilization, and preperitoneal packing; hemodynamically unstable patients with a negative FAST examination can be evaluated with a diagnostic peritoneal aspirate (DPA). If the DPA is positive, the patients go for emergent celiotomy, pelvic stabilization, and preperitoneal packing. For those patients with a negative FAST <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DPA, options include pelvic stabilization, preperitoneal packing, or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). The majority of patients will eventually require pelvic angiography, but preperitoneal packing and REBOA control pelvic bleeding more rapidly.

Even fractures without an &quot;open-book&quot; component can be wrapped, the primary goal being fracture stabilization and not reduction.</p><p>The simplest method for reducing pelvic volume is to tape the legs together in internal rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Alternatively, a sheet wrapped circumferentially around the greater trochanters and held in place with towel clamps is effective at reducing pelvic volume while permitting trauma assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115443\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115443 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62544\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62544 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. A video demonstrating techniques for applying a sheet is available in the following reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Commercial pelvic binders may also be used. Commercial devices include the Dallas Pelvic Binder, Geneva Belt, Stuart Splint, London Pelvic Splint, and the Trauma Pelvic Orthotic Device (TPOD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. These splints are placed around the iliac crests (Dallas and Geneva) or the greater trochanters (London, TPOD, and simple sheets). To date, no controlled study has shown commercial devices to be clinically superior to sheets or taping.</p><p>Great care should be taken not to over-reduce the fracture, especially with lateral compression injuries. Excessive reduction can create or increase an internal rotation deformity. Such a deformity places greater strain on the posterior pelvis, leading to greater diastasis, increased hemorrhage, and further injury. Over-reduction can be assessed clinically by the position of the patient's legs, greater trochanters, and patellae, which should lie in an anatomically neutral position.</p><p>Radiographs should be obtained after splint application to assess the adequacy of reduction. In severe lateral compression injuries, the sheet or splint is placed only to stabilize the pelvis, not to compress it. Three devices, the SAM Pelvic Sling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61466\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61466 \">picture 2</a>), TPOD, and the Pelvic Circumferential Compression Device (PCCD), limit the amount of force that can be applied, reducing the chance of internal rotation even in lateral compression injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p>Although sheets or commercial pelvic binders can be placed quickly and are effective, external fixators can also be placed in the emergency department by orthopedic or trauma surgeons to reduce fractures and control bleeding. In experienced hands, standard pelvic external fixators require approximately 15 minutes to place, but can interfere with abdominal surgery. Pelvic clamps (referred to as C-clamps) can be placed more quickly and may be rotated to avoid interfering with pelvic angiography or abdominal surgery.</p><p>In addition to aggressive resuscitation, patients with open pelvic fractures (ie, with exposed bone) require treatment with broad spectrum IV antibiotics and prophylaxis against tetanus. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefuroxime</a> is an appropriate choice. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> should be added if concern exists for infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Morbidity is also related to associated neurologic and genitourinary injuries.

Osteoarthritis develops in 26.6 percent of acetabular fractures, while 75.1 percent have a good functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7468319\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6979610\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric bones are covered by a thicker periosteum and are more pliable than adult bones. In addition, the ligaments of children are relatively stronger than the adjacent bone, as are the tendons compared to their related apophyses. Due to these differences, avulsion fractures of the pelvis and isolated pelvic ring fractures are more common in children, although the most likely location for such injuries does not differ from adults. Significant force is required for a child to sustain a complete pelvic ring disruption involving the posterior elements.

Pelvic fractures occur less frequently in children than adults, with pelvic ring disruptions and avulsion injuries most commonly described. The reported incidence of pelvic fractures among children admitted to the hospital following blunt trauma ranges from 2.4 to 7.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. According to one review that included 124 children with pelvic fractures, patients with such injuries represent 1.6 percent of all pediatric trauma admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, the true incidence of pediatric pelvic fractures is most likely higher, as suggested by a postmortem study of 66 blunt pediatric trauma deaths that found 93 percent had sustained posterior pelvic ring injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In the review cited above, mortality among children with non-avulsion pelvic fractures was five percent. Unlike adults, children die less often from pelvic hemorrhage but more often from concomitant injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p>With the exception of avulsion injuries, pediatric pelvic fractures generally result from high-energy mechanisms, most often involving a child being struck by a motor vehicle (57.8 percent), followed by motor vehicle crashes (17.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Avulsion fractures of the pelvis are more common in children than adults, and generally occur from less severe mechanisms, such as sports-related trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Published studies likely under-represent avulsion fractures as children with these injuries typically do not require hospital admission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7468357\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of avulsion fractures, pediatric pelvic fractures result from high-energy mechanisms that often cause significant concomitant injury. The rate of associated injury increases with the severity of the pelvic fracture, but data is limited, and thus, it is difficult to characterize precisely which injuries occur and how frequently. Concomitant injuries may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage &ndash; Life-threatening hemorrhage caused directly by pelvic fractures is uncommon in children, occurring in less than two percent of cases according to one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, bleeding from associated injuries does occur, as shown in one series in which 30 percent of patients required a blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The sites of bleeding are primarily intraabdominal (eg, liver, spleen) and thoracic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head Injuries &ndash; Head injuries, ranging from facial lacerations to intracranial hemorrhage, occur in as many as 40 percent of children with pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In one series of 39 children with pelvic ring fractures, approximately 8 percent of associated head trauma involved parenchymal brain injury and 10 percent were skull fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Chest/Abdomen</span> &ndash; Approximately 15 to 33 percent of children with pelvic fractures sustain some type of thoracic or abdominal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/72,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,76</a>]. A retrospective review comparing over 7000 adult and pediatric pelvic fracture patients did not find a correlation between higher grade pelvic fractures and the severity of spleen or hepatic injuries in children but did report a significantly higher rate of rectal injury among children with pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genitourinary &ndash; According to a systematic review of studies involving over 1000 total pediatric pelvic injuries, the overall incidence of genitourinary injury associated with pelvic trauma is 11 to 12 percent, including urethra (26.4 percent), vagina (14.9 percent), bladder (10.7 percent), and rectum (10.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

The incidence of concomitant spinal cord injury is approximately 3.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Overall, the range of concomitant neurologic injuries sustained by children with severe pelvic trauma is similar to adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremity &ndash; Fractures of the femur and tibia are the extremity injuries most often associated with pelvic trauma, occurring approximately 18 and 10.7 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7468372\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies and fracture types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs have limited sensitivity for detecting pediatric pelvic fractures, ranging from approximately 50 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/55,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,80,81</a>].

No definitive guidelines exist for CT scan indications; however, we recommend CT scan imaging for patients with pelvic ring injuries found on plain radiographs to better assess posterior involvement and for patients requiring further evaluation for abdominal trauma (eg, signs associated with intra-abdominal injury present on examination or ultrasound). In addition, CT imaging is warranted in patients with findings consistent with an unstable pelvis. Isolated avulsion fractures identified by plain radiograph generally do not warrant additional imaging with CT.

Based upon the CT results, pelvic ring fractures are described as either IIIA (isolated anterior ring fractures) or IIIB (involving anterior and posterior ring, stable). Stable fractures are defined by pelvic stability with manual compression and less than 2 mm of displacement on CT. According to a retrospective study of 124 children with pelvic fractures, patients with Type IIIB injuries were three times more likely to require ICU admission and 3.5 times more likely to require a blood transfusion than patients with Type IIIA injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7468393\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation and management of pediatric pelvic trauma is similar to that performed in adults.
