Signs and symptoms of upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower respiratory tract involvement are present, along with indications of systemic illness such as fever, headache, myalgia, and weakness. Although acutely debilitating, influenza is a self-limited infection in the general population (uncomplicated influenza); however, it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in certain high-risk populations (complicated influenza).</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the World Health Organization and its reporting network, tracks influenza virus isolates throughout the world to monitor disease activity and to predict the appropriate components for the annual influenza vaccine.

As a result, infection can be transmitted through sneezing and coughing and is thought to be via both large droplets (&gt;5 microns) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and small particle aerosols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Acquisition via large particle droplets requires close contact with an infected individual, since large particles do not remain suspended in the air and travel only short distances (approximately 6 feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], while small particle aerosols may travel for longer distances.</p><p>A study suggested that it may also be possible to transmit influenza by small aerosols that are released into the air during breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this study, 355 adults with acute respiratory illnesses were tested for influenza; influenza was confirmed in 142. Those with influenza provided nasopharyngeal and 30-minute breath samples (coarse [&gt;5 micron] and fine [&le;5 micron] fractions) within three days of symptom onset. Infectious virus was recovered by culture from 39 percent of the fine aerosol samples and 89 percent of the nasopharyngeal swabs (but was not evaluated in coarse aerosol samples because of technical limitations). In adjusted models, fine and coarse aerosol viral RNA were positively associated with body mass index and number of coughs and negatively associated with increasing days since symptom onset. Nasopharyngeal swab viral RNA was positively associated with upper respiratory symptoms but was not significantly associated with fine or coarse aerosol viral RNA or their predictors. Sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious aerosol generation.</p><p>Contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with respiratory droplets is another potential source of transmission and have also been shown to contain infectious virus. Although the respiratory tract is presumed to be the primary site for the acquisition of infection, one study has suggested that transocular entry of influenza virus can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Infection control measures to prevent the transmission of influenza in healthcare settings are discussed separately.

In a small influenza transmission study, the secondary attack rate was 25 percent among healthy individuals who socialized for 30 hours over a two-day period with volunteers who had been infected with influenza via intranasal drops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39276461\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of shedding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In otherwise healthy adults with influenza infection, viral shedding can be detected 24 to 48 hours before illness onset but is generally at much lower titers than during the symptomatic period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a review of 56 studies of 1280 healthy adults who were experimentally challenged with influenza virus, shedding of influenza virus increased sharply one-half to one day following exposure, peaked on the second day, and then rapidly declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The average duration of shedding was 4.8 days (95% CI 4.3 to 5.3 days). Shedding ceased after 6 or 7 days in most studies but occurred for up to 10 days in some. Studies of natural infection in healthy adults have shown similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/2,13,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,15-18</a>].

In one study, immunocompromised patients shed virus for a mean of 19.0 days, whereas immunocompetent patients shed virus for a mean of 6.4 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among 147 inpatients &gt;16 years of age with H3N2 influenza A infection, systemic glucocorticoid use and comorbidities such as chronic lung disease or diabetes were associated with slower viral clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Individuals who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> by symptom day 4 had an accelerated decrease in viral RNA concentration and clearance by one week. In a study that evaluated eight immunocompromised patients (seven with hematologic malignancy) who had shedding of influenza virus for &ge;2 weeks (median 30 days), lymphopenia was associated with prolonged shedding in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333377550\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnitude of shedding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The magnitude of shedding appears to correlate with the presence of symptoms and severity of illness, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of hospitalized patients with influenza, influenza virus release, as assessed by quantitative air samples, was associated with high viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples, coughing, and sneezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In a study of outpatients with influenza in which viral shedding was used as a proxy for infectiousness, the top 20 percent of infectious children and adults (as assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR) were responsible for 89 to 96 percent and 78 to 82 percent of total infectiousness in each age group, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">UNCOMPLICATED INFLUENZA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza characteristically begins with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/17,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29-32</a>], following an incubation period of one to four days (average two days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. These symptoms are accompanied by manifestations of respiratory tract illness, such as nonproductive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge. In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time at which illness began.</p><p>However, influenza infections also have a broad spectrum of other presentations that can range from afebrile respiratory illnesses similar to the common cold to illnesses in which systemic signs and symptoms predominate with relatively little clinical indication of respiratory tract involvement.

Fever is often higher in children than adults. Gastrointestinal illness, such as vomiting and diarrhea, are usually not part of influenza infections in adults but can occur in 10 to 20 percent of influenza infections in children.</p><p>Physical findings generally are few in cases of uncomplicated influenza. The patient may appear hot and flushed; oropharyngeal abnormalities other than hyperemia are uncommon, even with complaints of severe sore throat. Mild cervical lymphadenopathy may be present and is more frequent in younger patients. Physical examination of the chest is generally unremarkable in uncomplicated influenza, although mild ventilatory defects and increased alveolar-capillary diffusion gradients have been described in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Laboratory findings are generally not helpful in making the diagnosis of influenza.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average duration of influenza virus shedding in immunocompetent patients is five days. Shedding typically ceases after six or seven days but may continue for up to 10 days or more, particularly in children, older adults, patients with chronic illnesses, and immunocompromised hosts. (See <a href=\"#H39276461\" class=\"local\">'Duration of shedding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza characteristically begins with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise after an incubation period of one to four days (average two days). These symptoms and signs are accompanied by manifestations of respiratory tract illness, such as nonproductive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated influenza'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major complication of influenza is pneumonia, which occurs most frequently in certain groups of patients with underlying chronic illnesses who are classified as high risk for this infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72029 \">table 1</a>).
