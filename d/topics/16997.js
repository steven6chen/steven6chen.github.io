These abnormalities can result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). The use of testosterone to treat hypogonadism in adult men, primary or secondary, is reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of male hypogonadism, induction of spermatogenesis in men with secondary hypogonadism, and induction of puberty with testosterone are discussed elsewhere.

It can act directly by binding to the androgen receptor. It can also act in tissues that express the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, via conversion to dihydrotestosterone, which binds more avidly to the androgen receptor than testosterone itself. Finally, it can act as an estrogen following conversion by aromatase to estradiol, which binds to the estrogen receptor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> requires conversion to dihydrotestosterone for its action on the external genitalia (which include the prostate gland) and sexual hair. This mechanism provides the basis for the use of the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>, to treat benign enlargement of the prostate and male pattern baldness.

This is likely due, at least in part, to direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) encouraging use of testosterone products for nonspecific symptoms, such as decreased energy and sexual interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1417831311\" class=\"local\">'Impact of direct-to-consumer advertising'</a> below). It is important for clinicians to understand that the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency should be made <strong>only</strong> on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and consistently subnormal serum testosterone concentrations at 8 to 10 AM on three occasions.</p><p>For men with vague symptoms that could be the result of low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> (eg, fatigue) and a single but not repeatedly subnormal serum testosterone concentration, we recommend strongly against testosterone use. The Endocrine Society's guidelines and others also strongly advocate this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>]. Treatment should not be prescribed on a &quot;trial&quot; basis, because the results are not interpretable and because once men have started treatment, they may find cessation difficult because of the prolonged period of hypogonadism during recovery of the pituitary-testicular axis. In addition, testosterone therapy eventually results in suppression of spermatogenesis and decreased testicular size. (See <a href=\"#H2364392919\" class=\"local\">'Suppression of spermatogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1417831311\"><span class=\"h4\">Impact of direct-to-consumer advertising</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that DTCA is associated with and likely plays an important role in the increase of inappropriate use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> in healthy, middle-aged men (see <a href=\"#H863673533\" class=\"local\">'Inappropriate use of testosterone in healthy, middle-aged men'</a> above). In one study of 75 designated market areas with high rates of DTCA of specific testosterone products <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> testosterone deficiency (&quot;low T&quot;), approximately 1 of 17 million men (6 percent) had themselves tested for low testosterone for the first time between 2009 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Approximately 280,000 men (1.6 percent) started testosterone therapy during that interval. The study authors calculated that each exposure to DTCA was associated with a 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8 percent increase in testosterone testing, initiation of therapy, or initiation of testosterone therapy without baseline testing, respectively. Although the percentage changes are small, in large populations, the impact is large.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3938851\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of testosterone regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choosing among the different <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> preparations requires an understanding of their pharmacokinetics. Native testosterone is absorbed well from the intestine, but it is metabolized so rapidly by the liver that it is virtually impossible to maintain a normal serum testosterone concentration in a hypogonadal man with oral testosterone. The solutions to this problem that have been developed over many years involve modifying the testosterone molecule, changing the method of testosterone delivery, or both.</p><p>A number of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> preparations are currently available or are under development for treating testosterone deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94118 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>We usually suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> gels because they typically result in normal and relatively stable serum testosterone concentrations, and most patients prefer them to other preparations. However, other factors affect choice of regimen, including patient preference, cost, convenience, and insurance coverage, which varies by plan and regimen. In general, the newest preparations (the gels) cost the most, the patch costs somewhat less, and injectable esters cost the least.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several 17-alpha alkylated androgens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyltestosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyltestosterone</a>) have been available for oral use for many years, but we suggest <strong>not</strong> using them. Decades ago, investigators discovered that adding an alkyl group in the 17-alpha position of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> molecule retarded its catabolism by the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53955 \">figure 1</a>). Many endocrinologists who treat male hypogonadism think that these preparations are not fully effective in producing virilization, although no studies have tested these observations. In addition, several reports have described hepatic side effects with these preparations, including cholestatic jaundice, a hepatic cystic disease called peliosis hepatis, and hepatoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. For both of these reasons and because better preparations are available, the 17-alpha alkylated androgens should generally <strong>not </strong>be used to treat testosterone deficiency.</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> undecanoate is available in some countries but not the United States. This formulation has gastrointestinal side effects and does not keep the serum testosterone concentration normal in hypogonadal men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94118 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Parenteral testosterone</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198649145\"><span class=\"h4\">Long-acting injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> enanthate and testosterone cypionate are esters of testosterone that have been used for many years for the treatment of testosterone deficiency. The rationale for their use is that esterification of a lipophilic fatty acid to the 17-beta hydroxyl group of testosterone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53955 \">figure 1</a>) makes testosterone even more lipophilic than the native molecule. Intramuscular (IM) injection of testosterone esters results in their storage in, and gradual release from, the oil-based vehicle in which they are administered, thereby prolonging the presence of testosterone in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94118 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The therapeutic characteristics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> enanthate are relatively well described. In one report, for example, 100 mg of testosterone enanthate was administered once a week for 12 weeks to 12 men with primary hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The mean serum testosterone concentration increased to slightly higher than the upper limit of normal one to two days after the injection and gradually decreased to the midnormal range by the time of the next injection.</p><p>When the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> was increased to 200 mg in an attempt to prolong the dosing interval to every two weeks, the peak serum testosterone concentration increased further, and the nadir, just before the next injection, decreased to the low-normal range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74011 \">figure 2</a>). Regimens of 300 mg every three weeks and 400 mg every four weeks increased the peaks and decreased the nadirs further.</p><p>The serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), which were initially above normal in all of the men, decreased gradually after initiation of the 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> regimen and reached the normal range by six to eight weeks. Serum LH concentrations also decreased to normal with the 200 mg per two-week regimen, barely to normal with the 300 mg per three-week regimen, and remained supranormal with the 400 mg per four-week regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>These data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> enanthate can be administered once every one to two weeks in most men, every three weeks in a few, but not every four weeks. The doses used in this study were all somewhat excessive; we recommend for most men doses of 50 to 100 mg every week or 100 to 200 mg every two weeks.</p><p>Less information is available for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> cypionate, but the few studies that have been performed suggest that its characteristics are similar to those of testosterone enanthate. Testosterone enanthate has been in short supply in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], so the cypionate may be the only long-acting ester available in some settings.</p><p>An advantage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> enanthate and cypionate over other testosterone preparations is that they are biologically effective in initiating and maintaining normal virilization in all hypogonadal men. Another advantage to some men is freedom from daily administration. The disadvantages are the need for deep IM administration of an oily solution every one to three weeks and fluctuations in the serum testosterone concentration, which result in fluctuations in energy, mood, and libido in many patients.

Therefore, they are requiring that manufacturers of approved testosterone products change their labeling to clarify the approved uses of testosterone (see <a href=\"#H863673345\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate candidates'</a> above) and to add information about the possibility of increased risks of myocardial infarctions (MIs) and strokes in patients taking testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> treatment of hypogonadal men has generally not been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, as shown by an observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], a meta-analysis of 51 clinical trials that included seven trials with the outcome of MI (n = 1053 patients, relative risk [RR] 0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and a randomized trial published after data were analyzed for the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The meta-analysis, however, was done in men of variable ages and baseline risk for cardiovascular disease; some of the included trials were done in older men, while others were done in considerably younger human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men.

The lack of documentation of antecedent hypogonadism is particularly important because of the widespread and often inappropriate prescription of testosterone therapy for men with normal, age-associated symptoms who do <strong>not</strong> have hypogonadism.
