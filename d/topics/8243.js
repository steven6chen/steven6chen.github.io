High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Although hypertension is more common in adults, it often develops during childhood and adolescence, and can increase the risk of early heart disease and stroke during adulthood. Fortunately, high blood pressure is easy to measure and can be treated.</p><p>This topic discusses the treatment options for children and adolescents with high blood pressure. High blood pressure is divided into different stages based on the blood pressure measurement; categories include elevated blood pressure (blood pressure that is higher than normal but is not yet hypertension, formerly called &quot;prehypertension&quot;) and stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension. In general, interventions include lifestyle changes for anyone with high blood pressure. Medications are reserved for people with stage 2 hypertension, those with persistent stage 1 hypertension despite lifestyle changes, and those with elevated blood pressure who have chronic diseases. A child's blood pressure percentile and classification can be calculated here for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p>The causes and diagnosis of high blood pressure (hypertension) in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY TREAT HYPERTENSION?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several important reasons to treat high blood pressure in children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To <span class=\"nowrap\">prevent/treat</span> complications of hypertension in childhood, such as seizures or heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension that begins in childhood and adolescence may persist into adulthood. Adult hypertension is a major risk factor contributing to early heart attack or stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTENSION TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the treatment of hypertension is to treat any underlying cause for hypertension (secondary hypertension), if present.</p><p>If treating the underlying cause does not adequately reduce blood pressure, or if there is no known underlying cause (primary, formerly called &quot;essential&quot;, hypertension), treatments to reduce the blood pressure are recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics#H10\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Types of high blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment includes lifestyle changes (diet changes, regular exercise, and if appropriate, weight loss) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFESTYLE CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lifestyle changes are recommended for children with hypertension (defined as blood pressure &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile) or those with elevated blood pressure (defined as blood pressure &gt;90<sup>th</sup> to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile <strong>or</strong> if blood pressure exceeds <span class=\"nowrap\">120/80</span> mmHg in adolescents). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics#H3\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Normal versus high blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Lifestyle changes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary changes, including reducing salt intake and avoiding alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although cigarette smoke does not directly affect blood pressure, exposure to cigarette smoke (including secondhand exposure) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and should be avoided</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child is said to be obese or overweight based upon the body mass index, which can be calculated here for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-boys-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 3</a>) and here for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-girls-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are between the 85<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile are said to be overweight, while children who are above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile are said to be obese.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children who are obese or overweight, losing weight can help to lower blood pressure. In some cases, the child will be referred to a nutritionist, who can work with the child and parents to formulate a healthy eating plan.</p><p/><p>Weight loss is most effective at reducing the blood pressure when it is combined with exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular exercise can help to lower blood pressure in children and adolescents. Although exercise recommendations for an individual child may vary, general recommendations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per day most days of the week. Aerobic exercise includes walking, swimming, and biking, but not weight lifting or strength training.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedentary activities (watching television <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> playing video and computer games) should be limited to less than two hours per day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Participation in sports</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have controlled high blood pressure are generally allowed to participate in competitive sports. Children and adolescents with high blood pressure are advised to avoid weight lifting until the blood pressure is better controlled.</p><p>Exceptions to these recommendations include children with uncontrolled severe hypertension (stage 2 hypertension, see below) or those with abnormalities due to high pressure in their echocardiogram (cardiac ultrasound) such as thickened wall of the left ventricular chamber of the heart, who are generally advised to avoid competitive sports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing salt intake and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products can help to reduce blood pressure in children and adolescents with hypertension. When possible, the entire family should make these changes to encourage the child to develop healthy eating habits.</p><p>To reduce salt intake, some experts recommend using a no-salt added diet and avoiding or eating fewer foods with a high salt content. A full discussion of a low salt diet is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking and alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents who have hypertension should not smoke because it significantly increases their risk of heart disease and lung cancer. Family members of a child with hypertension are encouraged to quit smoking as well because exposure to secondhand smoke also increases the child's risk of developing heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple studies in adults have shown that drinking more than two alcoholic beverages per day significantly increases the risk of developing hypertension. Although studies in children are not available, children and adolescents should avoid alcohol for many other health and safety reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and adolescents, one or more medications may be recommended to reduce high blood pressure in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension associated with symptoms that are related to elevated blood pressure, such as headaches or seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 hypertension, defined as blood pressure level 12 mmHg greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;140/90</span> mmHg (whichever is lower).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 hypertension, defined as blood pressure level between the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile and stage 2, that persists after four to six months of nonpharmacologic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are physical signs of hypertension, such as a thickened wall of the left ventricular chamber of the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any stage of hypertension or elevated blood pressure in children with chronic kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any stage of hypertension in children with diabetes mellitus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Classes of antihypertensive medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several classes of antihypertensive medications commonly used to treat children. These include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of follow-up is dependent on the initial level of blood pressure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension who are treated only with nonpharmacologic therapies usually have their blood pressure monitored every three to six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If medications are given to lower blood pressure, the child or adolescent is generally seen every four to six weeks for medication changes until a stable regimen is established. If no additional changes are required, the time between follow-ups is gradually increased to three to six months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H716245600\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING AND GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents with prehypertension who are treated with nonpharmacologic therapies usually have their blood pressure monitored every four to six months. Those with hypertension are generally monitored more often depending upon the severity of their hypertension.</p><p>The goal blood pressure for most children with hypertension is less than the 90th percentile. If the child is obese or has high cholesterol, diabetes, or has organ damage related to hypertension, the blood pressure goal is lower. Blood pressure percentiles can be calculated here for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and here for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=1184\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
