Scale, erythema, pruritus, burning sensations, and pain are common associated features. </p><p>Although PPP involves a limited area, the disorder can have a significant negative effect on quality of life and can interfere with performance of activities of daily living. Patients with PPP on the soles of the feet may experience difficulty walking, and hand involvement may interfere with other activities.</p><p>PPP tends to have a prolonged course consisting of periods of exacerbation and partial remission. The treatment of the disease is often challenging, as responses to individual treatments are variable and unpredictable.</p><p>The management of PPP will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PPP are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palmoplantar-pustulosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palmoplantar pustulosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463081\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-quality data on the treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) are limited, contributing to uncertainty about the ideal approach to treatment. Although multiple randomized trials have been performed, most are small and of poor methodological quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Moreover, the lack of a standardized method for assessing the response to treatment, as well as the wide variability in treatment regimens, complicate comparisons of study findings.</p><p>Because of the variable and unpredictable response to treatment, our therapeutic approach consists of first treating with generally well-tolerated therapies that have been reported to be effective for improving PPP in conjunction with benign general measures to minimize symptoms. Our preferred first-line therapies are topical corticosteroids, oral retinoids, and photochemotherapy. Patients who do not respond to these interventions are candidates for other treatments. (See <a href=\"#H257463093\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H257463117\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463087\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the severity of the disease, we encourage all patients to engage in the following behavioral changes in an attempt to minimize symptoms and disease exacerbations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin moisturization </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Moisturization of the skin can help to mediate the discomfort associated with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) by helping to minimize formation of cracks and fissures in skin. We encourage patients to apply a bland, unscented, emollient moisturizer on affected areas and surrounding skin several times daily as needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of irritants </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Clinical experience suggests that skin irritation may contribute to exacerbations of PPP. In particular, we encourage patients to avoid wet work with the hands (eg, washing items with detergents or soaps) or to use gloves when engaging in such activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking cessation </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Although data are insufficient for definitive conclusions on the effect of smoking cessation on the course of PPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], we encourage all of our patients with PPP to stop smoking based upon knowledge of the strong link between smoking and PPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The findings of an uncontrolled prospective study of 63 adult smokers with PPP suggest there may be a benefit of smoking cessation; statistically significant improvements in the number of pustules and patient scores for disease severity were noted after three to six months among patients who stopped smoking, but not among the remainder of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A high dropout rate was among the limitations of this study. Additional studies are needed to explore the effect of smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palmoplantar-pustulosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H77149468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palmoplantar pustulosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463093\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-line therapeutic options for palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) include topical corticosteroids, an oral retinoid, and photochemotherapy. </p><p>Topical corticosteroids are often our initial choice for limited PPP (focal involvement on the palms or soles) based upon the ease of administration and well-tolerated nature of these agents. However, when patients present with extensive disease (diffuse palmar or plantar involvement) we usually begin oral retinoid treatment or photochemotherapy immediately in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463099\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroid therapy is an accepted first-line therapy for PPP and is the most widely used treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The major advantage of topical corticosteroid therapy is that it is a skin-directed treatment with a low risk for serious adverse effects that can be administered by the patient. Clinical follow-up to ensure proper use of topical corticosteroids is still required. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; There are few data on the efficacy of topical corticosteroids for PPP. An open-label right-left trial in which 19 patients with bilateral PPP were randomly assigned to apply <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> 0.1% cream (a medium potency topical corticosteroid) under a hydrocolloid dressing to sites of PPP on one side of the body every three days and to apply <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% cream (a super high potency topical corticosteroid) twice daily without occlusion to the contralateral side found that both treatments induced improvement in PPP after four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, significantly greater clinical improvement developed in sites treated with triamcinolone under occlusion than in sites treated with clobetasol without occlusion. Additionally, complete clearance occurred more frequently in the triamcinolone under occlusion areas (63 versus 16 percent of treated areas). Responses to both treatments were transient; symptoms recurred within a few weeks after treatment cessation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Benefit of topical corticosteroid therapy is also suggested by a retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among 49 patients with PPP who were treated with high potency topical corticosteroids (twice daily for up to four weeks followed by less frequent use of lower potency topical corticosteroids), marked, moderate, partial, and no improvement were documented in 27, 29, 20, and 24 percent of patients, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Our preferred regimen for topical corticosteroid therapy is a super high potency topical corticosteroid applied under occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). We typically instruct patients to apply the topical corticosteroid under a hydrocolloid dressing. The topical corticosteroid and a hydrocolloid dressing are reapplied every three days until clearance of active PPP or for a maximum of four weeks. A response to treatment is usually evident within the first two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there are <strong>no</strong> signs of clinical improvement after four weeks or worsening of symptoms occurs, we usually begin oral retinoid treatment or photochemotherapy. If the patient has partial improvement that seems likely to continue to improve with a longer course of topical corticosteroid therapy, we continue topical corticosteroid monotherapy for up to an additional four weeks, but decrease the intensity of treatment as tolerated (eg, treatment in place two days per week). If the response remains insufficient, we transition to other treatments. (See <a href=\"#H257463105\" class=\"local\">'Oral retinoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H257463111\" class=\"local\">'Photochemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternative methods to perform occlusion (eg, plastic wrap) are an option, but may require more frequent dressing changes. When plastic wrap occlusion is used, we instruct patients to apply the plastic wrap over the topical corticosteroid every night for one week, then every other night for two weeks followed by twice-weekly applications under plastic wrap for up to 13 additional weeks. Topical corticosteroids are not applied on the intervening occlusion-free days. We often see partial improvement within the first 10 to 20 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once patients achieve resolution of active disease with topical corticosteroid therapy, we institute maintenance therapy. Our goal is to reduce the intensity of treatment to application of the high potency topical corticosteroid <strong>without</strong> occlusion two days per week. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cutaneous atrophy is a potential adverse effect of topical corticosteroid therapy, particularly when high potency topical corticosteroids are used. The potential adverse effects of topical corticosteroid treatment are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463105\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral retinoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic treatment with oral retinoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>, etretinate) can be effective for PPP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; A 2006 systematic review identified several randomized trials that evaluated oral retinoid therapy for PPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pooling of data from four randomized trials that compared etretinate with placebo demonstrated that 72 percent of 67 patients treated with etretinate compared with 28 percent of 60 patients given placebo showed some improvement in PPP (rate ratio 2.54, 95% CI 1.65-3.91). Moreover, 39 versus 17 percent, respectively, achieved good or excellent responses (rate ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.20-4.46). The doses used for etretinate therapy in these trials varied; the duration of treatment ranged from 8 to 16 weeks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although etretinate is no longer available in many locations, including the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>, a metabolite of etretinate, appears to be similarly effective for PPP. A randomized trial that compared etretinate with acitretin in 60 adults with PPP found that both treatments were similarly effective for improving clinical manifestations of PPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients in both groups were given 30 mg of the assigned medicine for four weeks followed by upward or downward dose adjustments according to clinical improvement and tolerance of therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alitretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alitretinoin</a>, a newer oral retinoid, appeared beneficial for PPP in an uncontrolled study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], a phase 2 randomized trial, in which 33 adults with PPP (with or without psoriasis) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to alitretinoin (30 mg once daily) or placebo for up to 24 weeks, did not find alitretinoin more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Additional study is necessary to confirm the effects of alitretinoin in PPP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Our preferred treatment regimen for PPP in adults is an initial three-month course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> (50 mg per day). We usually begin with a 25 mg dose of acitretin and increase the dose by 10 mg per week as tolerated. Reductions in dose to reduce side effects are sometimes necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once satisfactory improvement is achieved, we aim to taper the drug to the lowest dose required to maintain improvement. In two randomized trials, maintenance treatment with etretinate demonstrated greater efficacy for maintaining remissions than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Side effects of oral retinoids can be limiting factors for therapy. Potential adverse effects include xerosis, cheilitis, dry mucous membranes, hypertriglyceridemia, hair loss, liver function test abnormalities, bone changes, and visual changes. Oral retinoids are teratogenic and pregnancy should be avoided for three years following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> therapy. Therefore, acitretin has a relative contraindication for use in women of childbearing age.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463111\"><span class=\"h2\">Photochemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy, which involves the oral or topical administration of a psoralen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a>) prior to exposure of affected areas to ultraviolet A light, can be effective for PPP. We typically administer oral PUVA rather than topical PUVA because there is greater support for the efficacy of oral PUVA therapy. Also, in our experience, topical PUVA can be irritating to the skin and is poorly tolerated by some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; The use of oral PUVA for PPP is supported by randomized trials that compared oral PUVA with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In a trial of 22 patients with bilateral PPP, a total of 30 treatment sessions of PUVA given four times per week on one randomly selected side of the body resulted in complete clearance of treated areas in 12 patients and great improvement in an additional five patients, whereas none of the untreated sides achieved these levels of improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The difference in effect between treated and untreated areas was statistically significant. In most cases, improvement was not seen until 10 to 20 treatments were administered and the mean number of treatments required for clearance of lesions was 26 (range 18 to 30). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The second trial compared oral PUVA (three times per week), etretinate (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), combination therapy with oral PUVA and etretinate, and placebo and no PUVA over a course of 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this open trial, thirty patients with severe bilateral PPP were randomly assigned to etretinate or placebo therapy, and after two weeks began oral PUVA photochemotherapy on affected areas of one side of the body. The proportion of the 12 areas that received 12 weeks of PUVA monotherapy that cleared or exhibited much improvement was significantly greater than among the 12 affected areas assigned to placebo and no PUVA (75 versus 17 percent). The results among areas treated with etretinate monotherapy did not differ significantly from oral PUVA monotherapy, a finding that contrasts with another 12-week trial that favored etretinate over oral PUVA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Combination therapy with an oral retinoid and PUVA appeared to be the most effective therapy. (See <a href=\"#H257463123\" class=\"local\">'Re-PUVA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although favorable responses to topical PUVA have been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], randomized trials evaluating topical PUVA have not demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. One trial comparing oral PUVA and topical PUVA did not find a significant difference in efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the response rates to oral PUVA reported in this trial were lower than reported in other studies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; We usually aim to administer oral PUVA three times per week and continue treatment for at least 12 weeks prior to concluding treatment inefficacy. Potential adverse effects of PUVA include burns, blistering, nausea, pruritus, phototoxicity, hyperpigmentation, premature aging of skin, and skin cancer. Adverse effects of PUVA are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy#H31513947\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463117\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not respond sufficiently to first-line treatment may benefit from combination therapy with an oral retinoid and PUVA or from immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463123\"><span class=\"h2\">Re-PUVA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;Re-PUVA&quot; is often used to refer to combination therapy with an oral retinoid and oral or topical psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy. The small randomized trials that have investigated the efficacy of this treatment support greater efficacy of Re-PUVA compared with either an oral retinoid or PUVA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/1,13,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,15,17</a>]. As an example, an unblinded trial in which 20 patients with bilateral palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) were randomly assigned to treatment with oral etretinate or no etretinate and given topical PUVA only on the right hand and foot found complete clearance occurred in 6 of 10 sites treated with etretinate and PUVA, 2 of 10 sites treated with etretinate alone, 1 of 10 sites treated with PUVA alone, and none of 10 sites that received neither treatment after 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A separate 20-week randomized trial that compared etretinate and oral PUVA with oral PUVA and placebo in 17 patients with PPP and 3 patients with hyperkeratotic palmoplantar psoriasis found that combination therapy was associated with a greater likelihood of response, significantly fewer treatments required for clearance, and a shorter time to response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Oral PUVA was started two weeks after the start of etretinate therapy and was given three times per week. </p><p>We usually begin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> therapy (25 to 50 mg per day) two to four weeks before the start of PUVA therapy when administering Re-PUVA treatment. Once PUVA treatment is started, we reduce the dose of acitretin to 10 to 20 mg per day. PUVA treatments are given two or three days per week. We are cautious with the initial dose of PUVA in this population because of concern for retinoid-induced thinning of the stratum corneum resulting in an increased propensity to burn. Thus, we reduce our initial PUVA dose by 30 to 50 percent compared with the dose we would use for a patient who is not on oral retinoid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy#H770375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Oral PUVA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257463129\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> can be beneficial for some patients with PPP.

In a trial in which 40 patients with PPP were randomized to treatment with oral cyclosporine (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or placebo, 17 of 19 patients who completed the four-week treatment phase had at least a 50 percent reduction in the number of pustules compared with 4 of 15 patients in the placebo group (89 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lower doses of cyclosporine may also be effective. A randomized trial by the same group in which 58 patients were randomly assigned to oral cyclosporine (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or placebo for one month found at least a 50 percent reduction in pustules in 48 percent of 27 patients in the cyclosporine group compared with 19 percent of 31 patients in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, we treat adults with a 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and begin to taper the dose after 10 days of sustained clinical improvement (at least 75 percent improvement from baseline).

Our typical duration of cyclosporine treatment lasts 12 to 24 weeks. Close monitoring for side effects is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our personal experience suggests that higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> may be effective for some patients who fail to respond to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day; we have successfully used doses of up to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. However, increased risk for side effects is a concern for treatment with higher doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; Although our personal experience suggests that methotrexate can be useful for PPP, data to support this assertion are limited. A retrospective study of 114 patients with PPP or palmoplantar psoriasis found that four of seven patients with PPP who were treated with 15 to 25 mg per week of methotrexate (57 percent) achieved marked improvement in their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A separate uncontrolled study in which patients were treated with 25 mg of methotrexate for two months found complete or almost complete resolution of PPP in 8 of 25 patients (32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palmoplantar-pustulosis-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most of the responders also had psoriatic skin lesions at other sites. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically treat with 7.5 to 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> <strong>per week</strong> given intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Methotrexate is <strong>not</strong> given daily. Oral administration of methotrexate (10 to 25 mg per week) is an additional option, though the risk for drug-related gastrointestinal distress may be higher. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Methods for beginning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy vary. We usually begin methotrexate therapy with a low dose (eg, 7.5 mg per week) and titrate upward by 2.5 mg per week if a complete blood count with differential performed one week after initiation (and dose increases) does not reveal hematologic toxicity and treatment is tolerated. The time course in which we expect to see improvement is 12 to 16 weeks. Following satisfactory improvement, we aim to taper the dose to 5 to 7.5 mg per week for maintenance therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Monitoring for adverse effects is important during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy, particularly at the start of therapy and following dose increases.

PPP is associated with symptoms of pruritus, burning sensations, or pain in involved areas and can have a significant negative effect on quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H257468162\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palmoplantar-pustulosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palmoplantar pustulosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PPP exhibits a chronic course characterized by exacerbations and partial remissions and can be difficult to treat. Therapeutic options include topical therapy, systemic therapy, and photochemotherapy. No treatment is uniformly effective and the response to treatment is unpredictable. (See <a href=\"#H257463081\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an attempt to reduce associated symptoms of PPP, we advise patients to keep skin moisturized and to avoid irritants that may exacerbate PPP. (See <a href=\"#H257463087\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a strong relationship between smoking and the development of PPP. Although data are insufficient for conclusions on the effect of smoking cessation on the course of PPP, we encourage all patients to stop smoking. (See <a href=\"#H257463087\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palmoplantar-pustulosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H77149468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palmoplantar pustulosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with PPP that is limited to focal areas of involvement, we suggest a super high potency topical corticosteroid applied under occlusion for the initial treatment of PPP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with diffuse eruptions on the palms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soles, we suggest initial treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> or oral psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Topical corticosteroid therapy may be administered concomitantly.
