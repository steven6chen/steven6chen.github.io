Thus, it can be perturbed by a number of systemic disorders.</p><p>This topic will review the myopathies associated with endocrine disease, malabsorption, electrolyte disturbance, critical illness, and rheumatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINE MYOPATHIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrine diseases are generally associated with hormonally-mediated systemic alterations in metabolism. At any time during the course of many endocrinopathies, muscle may become affected. The diagnosis of such a myopathy may be more difficult if it is the presenting manifestation of the endocrinopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothyroid myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle disease is a common complication of congenital and adult-onset hypothyroidism. Hypothyroid myopathy is briefly reviewed here and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroid-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroid myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with hypothyroidism frequently complain of weakness with or without cramps and myalgias. Patients of all ages and either sex may be affected, but hypothyroidism and therefore hypothyroid myopathy is more common in women. Weakness may be an initial symptom of hypothyroidism, or it may occur years into the course of the endocrinopathy.</p><p>Myopathic weakness in congenital hypothyroidism occurs in association with other manifestations of cretinism, is accompanied by prominent muscle hypertrophy, and responds to thyroid replacement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroid-myopathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroid myopathy&quot;, section on 'Congenital hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, the severity of muscle disease can range from asymptomatic elevation of serum creatine kinase to disabling muscle weakness. In addition to proximal muscle weakness, neurologic findings include sluggish or hung-up reflexes, myoedema (expansion of muscle following direct percussion), and, rarely, an increase in muscle bulk. In chronic hypothyroid myopathy, the triad of muscle hypertrophy, weakness, and creatine kinase elevation may occur. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported but occurs rarely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroid-myopathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroid myopathy&quot;, section on 'Clinical and laboratory manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of typical myopathic symptoms in the setting of hypothyroidism is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Electromyography is normal or shows myopathic changes. Muscle biopsy, if performed to exclude other conditions, shows nonspecific changes and only mild, if any, inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroid-myopathy#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroid myopathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid replacement usually leads to resolution of laboratory abnormalities and symptoms over a few to several weeks. Weakness may recover more slowly, over several months, and, in severely affected patients, may persist even longer. Pathologic changes in muscle may also persist after clinical recovery occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroid-myopathy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroid myopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthyroid myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle weakness with or without atrophy and myalgias occurs in 60 to 80 percent of patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. This discussion will briefly review hyperthyroid myopathy. A more detailed discussion is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Myopathy'</a>.)</p><p>Cramps are less common than with hypothyroidism. Patients with hyperthyroidism tend to develop muscle involvement more frequently after the age of 40. The likelihood of developing weakness, but not its degree, is correlated with the duration of the hyperthyroid state.</p><p>About two-thirds of patients with hyperthyroid myopathy report proximal weakness that usually begins several weeks to several months after the onset of hyperthyroidism. Hip flexors and quadriceps may be predominantly affected. The remainder has distal as well as proximal muscle involvement. Bulbar and respiratory muscle dysfunction occurs rarely. Weakness is sometimes the sole manifestation of the endocrinopathy. Myalgias may occur. Deep tendon reflexes are normal or increased, an unusual finding in a myopathic disorder. Paresthesias, due to coexisting polyneuropathy, may be present.</p><p>Laboratory testing usually shows a normal serum creatine kinase level; electromyography sometimes reveals &quot;myopathic&quot; motor unit potentials, but fibrillation potential activity is usually absent. Pathologic changes are typically nonspecific.</p><p>Treatment involves returning the patient to euthyroidism. Patients generally improve fully within four months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cushing syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle weakness is a common accompaniment of all types of hypercortisolism, both endogenous (Cushing syndrome and Cushing disease) and exogenous. The clinical features are similar in all of the cortisol excess states. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Muscle weakness in Cushing syndrome may be due to glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of protein synthesis with impairment in ribosome function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Accelerated protein catabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], changes in amino acid export from muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and alteration of carbohydrate metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] are all likely to play a role. Altered gene regulation and cell signaling by steroid hormones probably leads to some of these metabolic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is also enhanced protein turnover mediated by the ubiquitin-proteosome proteolytic pathway, which is stimulated by glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Clinically, weakness with atrophy occurs insidiously in 50 to 90 percent of patients with Cushing syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Patients usually have other physical features of hypercortisolism such as &quot;moon facies.&quot; The weakness, which may or may not be accompanied by myalgias, is proximal in distribution, first affecting the lower extremities and then the upper extremities. Facial and bulbar muscles are generally not involved, and diaphragm weakness occurs rarely. This respiratory involvement can be severe, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>On laboratory evaluation, the serum creatine kinase (CK) is normal. In fact, the serum CK and myoglobin are low when compared to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Electromyography is sometimes normal, but some short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials, compatible with myopathy, are often detected. Occasionally, insertional activity is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The major histologic finding is atrophy of type 2 muscle fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], especially type 2B (high glycolytic, low oxidative potential) muscle fibers.</p><p>Patients generally improve over months with treatment of the endocrinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. The greatest improvement occurs within three months, but strength and muscle mass may continue to increase for over a year. Improvement may be incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The treatment of Cushing syndrome depends on the etiology; options include pituitary or adrenal tumor removal, medical therapy to reduce hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone, and chemical adrenalectomy. Physical therapy may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe, subjective, generalized weakness has been described in up to 100 percent of patients with Addison's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Cramping and fatigue may also occur. Some patients develop lower extremity flexion contractures and myalgias as their primary complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Symptoms improve with the administration of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adequate clinicopathologic studies are lacking; therefore, it is difficult to clearly categorize the weakness as myopathic.</p><p>The mechanism of adrenal insufficiency-associated weakness is not established, but potential causes include changes in carbohydrate metabolism and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), a loss of exercise-induced glycogenolysis, and circulatory insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperaldosteronism with myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weakness is a very common complaint in patients with hyperaldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and it has been ascribed to potassium deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. On the other hand, objective weakness is rare, and in one report was seen in only one of 12 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other reported features include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study describing two patients with hyperaldosteronism and myopathy, serum creatine kinase levels were elevated in both, and the electromyography findings were &quot;myopathic&quot; in one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Some patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism also have osteomalacia, which alone is commonly associated with myopathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Osteomalacic myopathy and celiac sprue'</a> below.)</p><p>Rarely, a malignant necrotizing myopathy with vascular calcifications occurs in patients with hyperparathyroidism and uremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>On laboratory testing, serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are elevated, while the serum creatine kinase is normal. Electromyography findings are mixed and include short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials as well as high-amplitude, long-duration motor unit potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Limited reports of nerve conduction studies have been normal. Histopathologic studies of muscle reveal mostly atrophy of type 2 more than type 1 fibers.</p><p>The pathogenesis of hyperparathyroid myopathy is uncertain. There may be a neuronal or motor axonal component. Increased regulators of calcium homeostasis, namely parathyroid hormone and vitamin D, may be important in inducing weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Patients usually regain strength within weeks of treatment of the endocrinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Patients often have pain, which may be partly of myopathic and partly of bone origin.</p><p>Celiac sprue can present with osteomalacic myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Although neuropathy with or without ataxia are more common accompaniments of sprue, myopathy can be the primary neuromuscular presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Histopathologic features may include muscle inflammation, suggesting an autoimmune component.</p><p>Patients who develop malabsorption after gastric bypass can also develop vitamin D deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

An elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase is a clue to diagnosis. The 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 level is low, but 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 may be normal if there is increased renal conversion of vitamin D to the dihydroxy form in the setting of hypophosphatemia and elevated parathyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

Other considerations in the differential diagnosis include rhabdomyolysis, cachectic myopathy, and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Critical illness myopathy is the most common form of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired myopathy. Earlier studies suggested that the main risk factor for CIM was the use of intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in the ICU setting. However, the glucocorticoid association is now controversial, and critically ill patients may develop CIM in the absence of exposure to IV glucocorticoids. CIM usually begins several days or so after ICU admission.</p><p>Major electrophysiologic findings of CIM include normal to low-amplitude motor responses of prolonged duration and short-duration motor unit potentials coupled with normal or near-normal sensory potentials. Needle electromyography shows early or normal full recruitment. Some muscles exhibit electrical inexcitability to direct muscle stimulation. The major histopathologic findings are myopathy and myosin loss. Serum CK elevation is seen in approximately one-half of patients.

The stiffness is usually noted in the morning. It is often difficult to determine whether there is proximal muscle weakness because the examination is limited by pain. The pain usually worsens with activity. Imaging studies suggest inflammation in synovial tissues. Systemic features are common, including anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.) The RS3PE (Remitting, Symmetric, Seronegative [for rheumatoid arthritis] Synovitis with Pitting Edema) syndrome may be considered a variant of PMR when it responds to low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. It may also be associated with neoplastic disorders or other rheumatic diseases. These patients may also present with &quot;weakness&quot; due to pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, some patients with PMR develop giant cell arteritis of the head and neck, potentially leading to headache, jaw claudication, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, aortic aneurysm, cranial neuropathy, and even brachial plexopathy and stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typically, elevations in Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (&gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h)</span> and C-reactive protein are present. The serum creatine kinase level is normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Electromyography is also normal.

Microvascularization of muscle has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>There is usually a dramatic improvement with low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal muscle vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal muscle vasculitis typically occurs in association with either systemic vasculitis or isolated peripheral nervous system vasculitis. In either group, an associated vasculitic neuropathy is often the major peripheral nervous system clinical manifestation.</p><p>About 55 percent or more of patients with vasculitis affecting skeletal muscle have substantial myalgias and some degree of weakness. They may also exhibit weight loss and fever, and some (about 20 percent in one series) will have paresthesias due to an associated peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients with systemic vasculitides may also have fever, arthralgias, and involvement of other organ systems.</p><p>In polyarteritis nodosa, vascular occlusions and aneurysmal dilatations can affect digits and intra-abdominal organs. Skeletal muscle MRI with contrast may show small, fluffy enhancing lesions centered on blood vessels in addition to signal changes of muscle edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Other systemic vasculitides that may involve skeletal muscle include eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss), granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and microscopic polyarteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, HIV infection, and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome can develop skeletal muscle vasculitis, often in conjunction with a vasculitic peripheral neuropathy. MRI may reveal increased signal on slow tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences in affected muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Giant cell arteritis is only rarely associated with skeletal muscle vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Anemia and leukocytosis may be present. Other laboratory findings may reflect the presence of an underlying systemic disorder, such as anti-DNA antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus, and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic bodies in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and EGPA. Patients with polyarteritis nodosa may have associated hepatitis C or B virus infections.</p><p>Histopathologically, vasculitis is identified by the presence of fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall in conjunction with transmural inflammation. There may be vascular occlusion in a minority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In all types of systemic vasculitis, macrophages and lymphocytes of various types are commonly noted.</p><p>In polyarteritis nodosa, neutrophils may be seen within the inflammatory infiltrate, and, with EGPA, eosinophils are common. Giant cells are typically seen in the region of the internal elastic membrane in giant cell arteritis, and they are sometimes seen in other systemic vasculitides. With hypersensitivity vasculitis and vasculitis affecting small blood vessels, fibrinoid necrosis may not be evident, but there should be a transmural inflammatory infiltrate with nuclear debris.</p><p>The vast majority of muscle specimens also reveal evidence of neurogenic atrophy. Regenerating and degenerating muscle fibers are also seen in approximately 40 percent of biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends upon the cause of vasculitis. The treatments are addressed in the individual sections regarding these disorders. (See appropriate topic reviews).</p><p>In isolated peripheral nervous system vasculitis, treatment with corticosteroids alone is a consideration, but often <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> will be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a retrospective series that excluded vasculitis associated with inflammatory myopathic conditions, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, 33 patients with skeletal muscle vasculitis underwent corticosteroid therapy, and 19 received additional immunosuppressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Relatively uncommon features include distal weakness, muscle atrophy, focal axial myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], respiratory dysfunction, and claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Systemic features may include bruising, diarrhea, autonomic neuropathy, renal and cardiac dysfunction, and arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/55,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,60</a>]. MRI may identify distinctive reticulation of the subcutaneous fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p>The mean or median age at diagnosis is 60 to 67 years, but there is a wide range.

The clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic features may mimic an inflammatory myopathy. Cardiac troponin T levels may be elevated even in the absence of other features of cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Nerve conduction studies may reveal low peroneal or tibial motor amplitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Needle examination features include short duration motor unit potentials in all cases, and long duration motor unit potentials mainly in distal muscles in a minority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/55,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,62</a>]. At least half exhibit fibrillation potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/55,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,62</a>]. Complex repetitive or myotonic discharges are uncommonly encountered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopathies-of-systemic-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. There may be evidence of a coexisting axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy or mononeuropathy such as carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p>Pathologically, there is amyloid deposition around small blood vessels, encasement of muscle fibers by amyloid, and mild muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97036\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97036 \">picture 1</a>).
