In people who have coronary heart disease, the arteries that supply blood to the heart get clogged with fatty deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61785 \">figure 1</a>). Other names for this disease are &quot;coronary artery disease&quot; or just &quot;heart disease.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25721390\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of coronary heart disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with coronary heart disease have no symptoms. For those who do, the most common symptoms usually happen with exercise. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, pressure, or discomfort in the center of the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, tingling, or discomfort in other parts of the upper body &ndash; This might include the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling short of breath</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H936099321\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a heart attack?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first symptom of coronary heart disease can be a heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52579 \">figure 2</a>). That's why it is so important to know how to spot a heart attack.</p><p>The symptoms of a heart attack can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, pressure, or discomfort in the center of the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, tingling, or discomfort in other parts of the upper body, including the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, burping, or heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating or having cold, clammy skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A racing or uneven heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or lightheaded</p><p/><p>If these symptoms last more than 10 minutes or they keep coming and going, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> right away. Do not try to get to the hospital on your own.</p><p>As mentioned above, some people with coronary heart disease have chest pain even when they are not having a heart attack. This is most likely to happen when they are walking, going up stairs, or moving around. But if you have chest pain that is new or different than pain you have had before, you should see a doctor right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25721397\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for coronary heart disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have coronary heart disease, he or she might order blood tests and one or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An electrocardiogram (&quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;)</strong> &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A stress test</strong> &ndash; During a stress test, which is also called an exercise test, you might be asked to run or walk on a treadmill while you also have an ECG. Physical activity increases the heart's need for blood. This test helps doctors see if the heart is getting enough blood. If you cannot walk or run, your doctor might do this test by giving you a medicine to make your heart pump faster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An echocardiogram</strong> &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create an image of your heart as it beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;)</strong> &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart. Next, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-ray into the tube. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot; It can show whether any of the arteries in your heart are clogged.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25721404\"><span class=\"h1\">How is coronary heart disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatments for coronary heart disease are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> &ndash; Here are some things you can do to reduce your risk of heart attack and death:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quit smoking, if you smoke.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and foods with a lot of fiber. Avoid foods that have a lot of sugar.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Walk or do some form of physically activity on most days of the week.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; The medicines to treat heart disease are very important. Some medicines lower your risk of heart attacks and can help you live longer. But you must take them every day, as directed. Medicines your doctor might prescribe include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Aspirin</a> or other medicines that help prevent blood clots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to treat diabetes</p><p/><p>People who have chest pain caused by coronary heart disease (called &quot;angina&quot;) can also get medicines to relive their pain. These medicines might include &quot;nitrates,&quot; &quot;beta blockers,&quot; and others.</p><p>Some people with coronary heart disease can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A stent procedure</strong> &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor puts a thin plastic tube into the blocked artery, and uses a tiny balloon to open the blockage. Then the doctor leaves a tiny mesh tube called a &quot;stent&quot; inside the artery to hold it open.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bypass surgery</strong> (also known as &quot;coronary artery bypass grafting&quot; or CABG) &ndash; During bypass surgery, the doctor removes a piece of blood vessel from another part of the body. Then he or she reattaches the blood vessel above and below the area that is clogged. This re-routes blood around the clog and allows it to get to the part of the heart that was not getting blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73589 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>If your doctor recommends stenting or bypass surgery, ask these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this procedure for me? Will the procedure help me live longer? Will it reduce my chance of having a heart attack? Will I feel better if I have this procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of the procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I don't have this procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25721484\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-recovery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack recovery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nuclear-heart-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nuclear heart testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stenting-for-the-heart-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stenting for the heart (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-choices-for-angina-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment choices for angina (chest pain) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=can-foods-or-supplements-lower-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Can foods or supplements lower cholesterol?
