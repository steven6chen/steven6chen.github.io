The jaw joint, called the &quot;temporomandibular joint,&quot; is located in front of the ear where the jawbone connects to your head. To feel the joint, place your finger on your cheek just in front of your ear and then open and close your mouth.</p><p>When doctors refer to temporomandibular joint disorders, they often use the term &quot;TMJ&quot; for short. TMJ disorders can be caused by many problems, including arthritis. Sometimes TMJ is due to a combination of stress, jaw clenching, teeth grinding, and other things that strain the jaw joint and the muscles around it. Some people with TMJ also have anxiety, depression, or an increased awareness of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954801\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of TMJ?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom of TMJ is a dull pain on just 1 side of the face, near the ear. Sometimes the pain also affects the ear, jaw, or back of the neck. Some people have headaches with TMJ. The pain of TMJ is typically constant, but may come and go. It is usually worse with jaw movement. People with TMJ might hear a clicking or popping sound or have a &quot;crunchy feeling&quot; in the joint when they open and close their mouth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954816\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the pain in your face or jaw is bothering you and does not go away, you should see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954831\"><span class=\"h1\">What tests might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single test that can show if you have TMJ. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have TMJ by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>Unless the doctor suspects something unusual, most patients will <strong>not</strong> need X-rays or an MRI (an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of your body).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954846\"><span class=\"h1\">How is TMJ treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single treatment for TMJ works for everyone. Most of the time, medicines and simple lifestyle changes can help. Most patients get better over time, even without treatment, so patience is important.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will help you find the right mix of treatments for you. He or she might refer you to a dentist who specializes in TMJ. Treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education and self-care &ndash; This includes following instructions from your doctor about how to avoid things that trigger TMJ pain. It also involves learning different ways to help you relax and manage stress. Some people might also improve with simple jaw exercises they can do on their own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve pain and relax the muscles &ndash; There are several types of medicines used to treat TMJ. These include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and certain medicines used for depression. (Medicines for depression can relieve pain even in people who are not depressed.) Your doctor will decide which medicine or group of medicines is best for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bite <span class=\"nowrap\">plates/splints</span> &ndash; These are special devices that fit in your mouth and keep you from grinding your teeth at night. They are made out of either a hard or soft plastic and might be made specially to fit your mouth. If you have sleep apnea, be sure to tell your doctor as the bite plate or splint might make your sleep apnea worse.</p><p/><p>If these treatments don't help, your doctor might suggest that you see a specialist, such as an oral surgeon. The specialist might use medicines given by injection (shots) to treat the pain. It is rare that people need surgery for TMJ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954876\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pain (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
