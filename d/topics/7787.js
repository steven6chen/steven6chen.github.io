Normally, the kidneys filter toxins out of the bloodstream and excrete them in the urine but keep red blood cells and protein in the bloodstream. In people with glomerular disease, red blood cells and protein may be excreted into the urine, while toxins may be retained.</p><p>Glomerular disease can occur by itself (ie, affect only the kidney) or may be associated with an underlying medical condition that affects other organ systems, such as lupus, diabetes, or certain infections. Glomerular disease can develop suddenly (&quot;acute&quot; glomerular disease) or develop slowly over a period of years (&quot;chronic&quot; glomerular disease). Treatment of glomerular disease depends upon its cause and type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL KIDNEY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To understand glomerular disease, it may be helpful to understand how the kidneys normally function. The kidneys are bean-shaped, approximately fist-sized organs that are located in the mid-back, just below the rib cage on each side of the body.</p><p>The kidneys filter the body's blood supply with tiny structures, known as nephrons. Each kidney contains hundreds of thousands of nephrons. Each nephron is composed of a glomerulus and a tubule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82497 \">figure 1</a>). The glomerulus filters wastes and excess fluids, while the tubules modify the waste to form urine. Glomerular disease affects the glomerulus, causing it to filter and excrete incorrectly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR DISEASE FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of glomerular disease depend upon the cause. The first sign of a problem may be a urine test (urinalysis) that comes back abnormal after being done for another reason. The urinalysis may detect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More red blood cells than normal &ndash; In addition to showing up on urinalysis, this sometimes causes the urine to look light or dark brown in color. The medical term for blood in the urine is &quot;hematuria.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More protein than normal &ndash; The medical term for this is &quot;proteinuria.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-in-the-urine-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Signs and symptoms may also include an elevated blood pressure (greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg); fluid retention (edema) in the hands, face, feet, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdomen; fatigue (due to anemia or kidney failure); or urinating infrequently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two basic types of glomerular disease include nephritic and nephrotic, but, with some diseases, the two types can overlap. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephritic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key feature of nephritic disease (&quot;glomerulonephritis&quot;) is blood in the urine (hematuria). In milder disease, there may not be significant impairment of kidney function or proteinuria. In fact, a person with glomerulonephritis may not have any symptoms, and their condition may go unnoticed until blood and protein are found during a routine urinalysis. People with more severe nephritic disease have hematuria and, often, impaired kidney function. Urine testing may also show high levels of protein, and the person may have edema (swelling in the lower legs) or high blood pressure.</p><p>Examples of conditions that may cause glomerulonephritis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain bacterial and viral infections (postinfectious glomerulonephritis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed cryoglobulinemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alport syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with nephrotic syndrome have protein in the urine (proteinuria) but, often, little to no blood in the urine (hematuria). Kidney function may worsen as nephrotic syndrome progresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples of conditions that may cause nephrotic syndrome include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal change disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Membranous nephropathy (including lupus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic nephropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (later stage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA nephropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary amyloidosis or the related disorder light chain deposition disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR DISEASE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular disease is diagnosed based on the results of blood or urine tests. Other tests, including imaging tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kidney biopsy, may be used to help diagnose the specific type of glomerular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinalysis may show red blood cells (which are seen when there is damage or inflammation in the glomeruli), white blood cells (which can indicate inflammation), or increased protein levels (which is an indicator of glomerular damage).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood tests are used to measure the level of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which become elevated when the kidneys are damaged and are not filtering properly. Blood tests may also be used to diagnose underlying medical conditions (such as diabetes, lupus, or certain infections).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ultrasound of the kidney is frequently recommended if glomerular disease is suspected, primarily to rule out other causes of blood in the urine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased kidney function. The ultrasound can also measure the size of the kidneys, which can provide a clue as to the duration of the kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A kidney (renal) biopsy may be needed to definitively determine the cause of glomerular disease in patients that cannot be diagnosed by blood tests or imaging tests alone. A separate topic review discusses renal biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR DISEASE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of glomerular disease depends upon the form (acute or chronic), the underlying cause, and the severity of associated signs and symptoms. Some forms of glomerular disease, such as that caused by infection, improve after the infection is treated.</p><p>Other types of glomerular disease may require treatment with medications that suppress the immune system, such as glucocorticoids (commonly called steroids). Cyclophosphamide (brand name: Cytoxan) or azathioprine (sample brand names: Azasan, Imuran) may be used as well. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is sometimes treated with plasmapheresis, a procedure to filter the blood and remove substances that could be causing the inflammation.</p><p>Some forms of glomerular disease do not require treatment, while others do not respond to any therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Managing high blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of high blood pressure is important to prevent further damage to the kidneys; one or more medications may be needed. One or more high blood pressure medications may be recommended for patients with chronic glomerular disease to decrease the amount of protein in the urine and slow the rate of progression of kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-diet-and-weight-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure, diet, and weight (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR DISEASE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some types of glomerular disease are associated with complications, including high blood pressure, acute or chronic kidney failure, and nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">High blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High blood pressure can develop in people with glomerular disease due to kidney damage and buildup of waste products and excess fluid in the bloodstream. One or more medications may be needed to reduce blood pressure and prevent further damage to the kidneys. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden onset (acute) kidney failure is more likely to occur with acute glomerulonephritis (eg, diffuse nephritic). If the glomeruli are unable to filter the blood adequately, waste products and excess fluids build up in the bloodstream quickly. Hemodialysis may be needed to remove waste products and excess fluids. This could be temporary, until the kidney function recovers, or may be long term if the kidneys become damaged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hemodialysis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic kidney failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If kidney function continues to worsen, dialysis or kidney transplantation may be needed to perform the normal functions of the kidneys. There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
