As a result, the differential diagnosis of childhood joint pain and swelling is large and includes both benign and serious conditions. The assessment of a child with joint pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling needs to differentiate between conditions of varying severity, especially those that require urgent medical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of a child with joint pain or swelling is reviewed here. Although there is overlap among the causes of limping, hip pain, and joint swelling and pain, the causes and approaches to assessing a child with limp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hip pain are discussed separately.

In particular, signs and symptoms that are cause for concern (ie, red flags or danger signs that suggest an underlying serious condition) should be sought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322209052\"><span class=\"h2\">Worrisome findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are certain signs and symptoms in the child who presents with joint pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling that may indicate the presence of a more serious condition requiring urgent medical attention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105586 \">table 2</a>). These findings are typically uncovered during the initial history (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> below) and physical exam.

The characterization of swelling is also important and includes many of the same elements as those for pain, as well as the presence of associated findings of warmth and discoloration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of precipitating factors, such as a history of trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of systems focusing on history of rash, weight loss, abdominal pain, and ocular abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions associated with arthritis or arthralgias. These include celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic lung or cardiac disease with hypoxia, uveitis, psoriasis, and cystic fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history &ndash; It is important to ask about the presence of psoriasis, hypermobility syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthropathies, uveitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bony dysplasias in close relatives as these conditions have a genetic basis and may be associated with arthritis in the child. The likelihood that joint pain is due to an autoimmune condition is increased if a family member has suffered from an autoimmune disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune deficiency syndrome. This likelihood further increases if family members on both maternal and paternal sides are affected. The health and medical history of the patient's siblings may also be informative.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322207828\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of fever narrows the differential diagnosis significantly. If there is a history of fever, it is important to ascertain the timing and pattern of fever and the height of elevated temperature.</p><p>Fever may precede or present at the same time as joint symptoms in children whose disease is due to bacterial infection. High fever (temperature greater than 38&deg;C) in a patient with monoarticular disease is typical of a bacterial infection of the joint or bone. However, subacute or partially treated infection may not be accompanied by significant fever. Fever also<em> </em>might have been present during an antecedent illness that preceded the development of reactive arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antecedent infection'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever is also associated with noninfectious diseases including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Kawasaki disease, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In some conditions, the pattern of fever is an important clue to the diagnosis, as demonstrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic JIA is associated with a quotidian fever pattern. A daily spike of high fever often occurs in the afternoon or evening, with a return to normal or even subnormal temperature between fevers, typically in the early morning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Fever'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic fever syndromes, such as familial Mediterranean fever, have a characteristic pattern of irregular, intermittent episodes of fever. These last for a few days or longer, resolve spontaneously, and give way to weeks of normal temperature. During the febrile episodes, patients may have joint pain and swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fever in patients with SLE has a gradual onset and is typically low grade and intermittent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain, swelling, and stiffness characterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain and swelling are characterized by their location, severity, frequency, duration, and factors that either exacerbate or relieve the finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78083 \">table 3</a>). Joint stiffness is also a common feature but, like pain, is subjective and may be difficult to quantify.</p><p>The following questions help to characterize the child's joint pain and swelling:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe is the pain, swelling, or stiffness?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where is the location(s) of the pain, stiffness, or swelling?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many and which joints are involved?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When and for how long have the joint(s) been painful, stiff, or swollen?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly did the pain, swelling, or stiffness appear?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What makes the pain, swelling, or stiffness better or worse?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the severity or intensity of pain or stiffness should be assessed, one must be careful not to equate severity of pain or stiffness with severity of illness, because the perception of pain is subjective. However, pain severe enough to cause the child to refuse to put any weight on the affected limb is a &quot;red flag&quot; for serious illness, such as bacterial infection of the joint or bone (eg, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis) or malignancy (eg, leukemia and osteosarcoma). In contrast, JIA, Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and transient synovitis are often associated with limping, but the pain is generally not severe enough for a child to refuse to bear weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Young children and infants may have difficulty articulating the presence of pain and may not complain of joint pain even when there are obvious signs of joint inflammation and swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In cases that involve the lower extremities, the young child may manifest pain as a refusal to walk or walking with a limp, and, in those that involve the upper extremities, the patient may limit the movement and use of the involved arm.</p><p>In an adolescent who complains of excruciating pain, often accompanied by inability to walk, but does not seemed to be particularly bothered by the problem (&quot;la belle indifference&quot;), a pain disorder such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1 or fibromyalgia may be the likely diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain that wakes a child in the middle of the night is generally severe and is a useful diagnostic clue as it is more commonly seen in patients with bony pain due to benign tumors, such as osteoid osteoma, or malignancies, such as leukemia. Although other benign conditions such as growing pains also occur typically at night, these children are always entirely well during the day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growing-pains\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growing pains&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Significant joint symptoms are likely to interfere with daily activities, such as walking long distances, participating in sports or physical education, and playing musical instruments. Involvement of the small joints of the hand may interfere with writing, buttoning clothes, and opening jars and bottles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Location and number of involved joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the site(s) of the <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/swelling</span> is important to develop a rational list of differential diagnoses and to direct subsequent evaluation and treatment. Involvement of a single joint is more concerning for an acute process and warrants more urgent evaluation than involvement of multiple joints.</p><p>It may be challenging to have children localize pain accurately, especially younger children. Children should be asked to tell or to point to the painful area(s). For the nonverbal child, family members are asked what led them to think that the child has a joint problem and whether they noted any unusual warmth or swelling of the joint(s).</p><p>There is overlap between causes of monoarticular and polyarticular pain and swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57734 \">table 1</a>). However, it is important to determine the number of involved joints because infection is a relatively common cause of acute pain and swelling in a single joint, which can result in cartilage destruction within a few days if not treated. As a result, patients with monoarticular involvement need to be assessed urgently to ensure that therapy can be initiated as quickly as possible in those suspected of having a bacterial infection as the cause of their symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single joint involvement &ndash; Bacterial infections (eg, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis) and significant trauma (eg, fracture or hemarthroses) are important causes of pain in a single joint that must be considered without delay, as discussed above. Other common causes of monoarticular pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling include osteonecrosis (ie, Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease), oligoarticular JIA, Lyme arthritis, and some cases of reactive arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple joint involvement &ndash; As bacterial infection and significant trauma rarely affect multiple joints, there is less urgency to evaluate a child with polyarticular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Causes of multiple joint pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling include connective tissue disorders, such as SLE, JIA, and inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Frequency, duration, and pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain and swelling can be characterized based upon their frequency, duration, and pattern:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent, intermittent, and migratory <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/swelling</span> &ndash; Persistent pain is characteristic of inflammation of the joint space commonly seen in patients with arthritis that is due to infection or a rheumatologic disorder or bony pain due to a neoplastic process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intermittent pain, particularly associated with activity, is more likely due to a mechanical problem (eg, patellofemoral pain, meniscal or ligamentous injuries of the knee, or rotator cuff impingement disorder in the shoulder). In addition, recurrent pain and swelling of one or two large joints followed by spontaneous resolution, particularly in the knees, is characteristic of Lyme arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Migratory joint pain is pain that lasts for several days in one or more joints and then resolves while other, previously unaffected joints become painful. It can be seen in patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) or poststreptococcal reactive arthritis, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), and childhood leukemia or lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the presentation and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time of day &ndash; Diurnal variation is an important distinguishing feature of many different causes of joint pain that aids in identifying the underlying diagnosis. Joint pain due to arthritis, such as JIA, is usually worse at the beginning of the day and improves throughout the day with movement and activity. In contrast, pain due to trauma or mechanical causes (eg, hypermobility, torn meniscus, patellofemoral pain, or Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease) is usually mild or nonexistent in the morning and worsens with activity or may only occur after increased physical activity. Growing pains typically occur in a well child, with pain that may affect the joint usually beginning at the end of the day and into the middle of the night, but not during the daytime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although bone tumors can cause nocturnal pain, the child also has pain during the day.

Judging the degree of trauma and determining the temporal relation between the trauma and the child's presentation are important in deciding whether trauma can be the cause or a contributing factor to a child's joint symptoms. In a significant traumatic injury, the precipitating event is usually associated with the immediate onset of pain, swelling, and sometimes bruising. In some cases, however, an episode of minor trauma may simply bring to attention a pre-existing, but as yet undiagnosed and unrelated, condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Antecedent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recent infections, especially with enteric pathogens (<em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Yersinia</em>, and <em>Campylobacter</em>), viruses (eg, parvovirus B19 and varicella), Group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, and immunization (eg, rubella immunization), may be associated with reactive arthritis, a common cause of acute arthritis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, the arthritis of ARF, a sequel of a group A streptococcal pharyngeal infection, typically occurs two weeks after the precipitating infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reactive arthritis is broadly defined as an arthritis that develops soon after or during an infection elsewhere in the body but in which the micro-organisms cannot be recovered from the joints. In the most restrictive definition, reactive arthritis has been used to refer to the triad of postinfectious arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, formerly called Reiter syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">Inactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint pain or stiffness that is worsened by periods of inactivity (called articular or inactivity gelling) is typical of chronic inflammatory arthritis, such as seen in some cases of JIA or SLE. An important question to ask is whether the child appears stiff in the morning with gradual resolution or improvement during the day's activity. Some parents will volunteer that their child &quot;looks like an old man&quot; after getting up in the morning. Very young children may simply be irritable upon awakening and ask to be carried until they feel better.

If the joint pain location is asymmetrical or worse on one side than the other, compare both extremities, looking for differences in size and shape. Does the child hold an affected joint in a particular position of comfort? If a joint appears bigger than the corresponding contralateral articulation, further assessment will need to determine if joint effusion, synovial thickening, edema of the soft tissue overlying the joint, bony overgrowth, or some combination of these abnormalities has led to the increase in joint size. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Palpation'</a> below.)</p><p>Even if only a single joint is painful, the entire extremity should be examined to detect the presence of muscle atrophy, discrepancies of length, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized asymmetry. There are two commonly used clinical methods for measuring an apparent leg length discrepancy. The most accurate is to correct any pelvic tilt (observed from behind) by asking the child to stand with the foot of the shorter leg on an object of measurable height, such as a book, magazine, or even a specifically fashioned wooden block (a &quot;lift&quot;). Alternatively, each leg length can be compared after careful measurement from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus, although this method is subject to considerable observer error.</p><p>The skin overlying the joint should be inspected for evidence of scars, bruises, and discoloration, which could be caused by a rash or inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h4\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to assess any differences in the temperature of the skin overlying the affected joint. Increased warmth of the affected joint compared with the unaffected side can indicate inflammation due to infection or rheumatologic disorder. Extremities affected by CRPS type 1 can be either cooler or warmer than the unaffected side.</p><p>Palpation includes assessment for the presence and location of tenderness. Joint tenderness may be secondary to disorders of the bone, such as osteomyelitis, bone tumor, other causes of periostitis, or Osgood-Schlatter disease; synovial disease, such as arthritis; or abnormalities of the ligaments, tendons, and menisci. Palpation of the &quot;entheses&quot; (points of insertion of ligament, tendon, or joint capsule into bone) is of particular importance in determining the subtype of JIA (usually associated with enthesitis-related arthritis or spondyloarthritis) and occasionally in other musculoskeletal and rheumatic diseases. Inflammation at these points of insertion is referred to as &quot;enthesitis.&quot;</p><p>If osteomyelitis is suspected, a careful palpation of the bone should be performed, and it should start away from the painful area and move towards it slowly. In a febrile child, severe pain in a localized area of bone (&quot;point tenderness&quot;) is indicative of possible osteomyelitis. In a nonfebrile child, there is a wide differential diagnosis for point bone tenderness, including fracture, periostitis, benign or malignant neoplasia, and enthesitis. Subacute osteomyelitis is also possible in the afebrile child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>If swelling is present, palpation may help determine the nature of the enlargement. A cystic or fluctuant quality to the swelling suggests a fluid collection that may be indicative of a joint effusion, ganglion, meniscal cyst, bursal swelling, or abscess. A doughy or rubbery consistency suggests synovial thickening, whereas, a hard, bony feel may indicate osseous overgrowth (eg, bone tumor or exostosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h4\">Range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ROM is an important part of the examination of a child with joint pain; however, if there is severe pain, particularly if there is a history of trauma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an obvious deformity, it is prudent to splint the involved joint and proceed to obtain radiographs to rule out a fracture or dislocation.</p><p>In the absence of severe pain, deformity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of significant trauma, joint function is assessed with the following questions in mind:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the ROM limited and, if so, to what degree? While most joints are limited in movement to flexion and extension, a few joints move in other planes, resulting in a greater ROM. These include the hips, shoulders, spine, wrists, and ankles. Active and passive ROM should be noted in abduction and with internal and external rotation of the hips and shoulders. A particularly valuable technique is to assess the degree of relaxed passive extension of the knees by raising both legs using the feet while the patient is supine and asking the patient to relax. The knees should have up to 10 degrees of recurvatum (hyperextension), and any asymmetry may indicate a subtle but significant loss of joint range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, one of the biggest mistakes that nonspecialists make when testing passive ROM is not pushing the joint to the limits of its ROM. Frequently in arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, there may be very subtle abnormalities that are missed when this is not done. As an example, in the knee, where loss of the normal few degrees of &quot;relaxed passive extension&quot; may be the only indication of knee pathology, a few degrees of motion may be the sole distinguishing feature between an arthritic joint and a normal one. To demonstrate this finding, while the child lies supine and relaxed with the legs extended, the feet are gently lifted off the bed by the examiner (as described in the preceding paragraph). If there is asymmetry of the expected 5 to 10 degrees hyperextension of the knees, pathology is generally found in the side that has &quot;lost&quot; relaxed passive extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there excessive joint mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]? Excessive mobility of the joint, which may be associated with joint pain, can be seen in benign hypermobility syndrome, which may be associated with increased musculoskeletal pain and in pathologic joint laxity syndromes, such as Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-hypermobility-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint hypermobility syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there pain with motion? If palpation and movement of the painful joint do not reproduce or exacerbate the pain, then referred pain should be suspected. As an example, knee pain may arise from a problem at the hip. If the hip and knee are normal on examination, consider an even more proximal site, such as the spine or retroperitoneum. For example, pyomyositis of the psoas (psoas abscess) typically presents with hip pain and flexion deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is muscle strength normal? Muscle weakness, especially proximal weakness, may be an indication of myopathy, such as dermatomyositis or muscular dystrophy.

In fact, most rheumatologic disorders affecting children are diagnosed based upon the history and physical examination, and imaging and laboratory studies are used to confirm or grade the pathology. Some of the most common rheumatic diseases of children, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), may have few or no associated laboratory abnormalities. Diagnostic studies may help to exclude other conditions or support one's clinical impression, but rarely do they reveal a previously unsuspected diagnosis. A particular danger for the inexperienced clinician is finding and dealing with irrelevant or inconsequential &quot;abnormalities&quot; as a result of performing an overenthusiastic battery of investigations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint aspiration and examination of the synovial fluid should be performed in any child with clinical features suggestive of septic arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75192 \">table 6</a>) to either make the diagnosis or rule it out. Acute onset of fever with joint pain, swelling, and limited range of motion (ROM) in a single joint of the lower extremity is the classic presentation for bacterial arthritis. However, the presentation varies depending upon the age of the child, the site of infection, and the causative organism. As examples, the classical signs of sepsis may be missing in a child with tuberculous arthritis, an indolent condition that usually presents as monoarthritis, and with <em>Kingella kingae</em> infection, which is typically insidious, indolent, and with low-grade or no fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

This is unlike the situation in adults, in whom other illnesses, such as gout, make arthrocentesis a more important diagnostic tool. In addition, the procedure is probably more painful and traumatic to a pediatric patient.</p><p>If it is necessary, older children usually can tolerate joint aspiration with the use of local anesthetics. Younger children and those requiring aspiration of a shoulder or hip may require procedural sedation or general anesthesia.

Indications for these studies depend upon the diagnoses suspected and the joint(s) involved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of conditions with presentations similar to JIA &ndash; Plain radiographs of the affected joint are useful in ruling out several of the differential diagnoses of JIA, including fractures, periostitis, avascular necrosis, hematologic malignancies, bone tumors, and bone dysplasias, and should be performed on every child in whom there is concern for one of these diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually reserved for instances when bone infection, traumatic joint injury, or tumor is of concern and computed tomography (CT) for fractures that are not evident on plain radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Plain radiographs are almost always the best initial imaging test to perform when evaluating these children. Decisions regarding more advanced imaging should be discussed with an experienced radiologist. On the other hand, contrast-enhanced MRI and joint ultrasound scans to demonstrate joint effusions and synovitis are more commonly used than plain radiographs in the evaluation and management of JIA once the diagnosis is made. In cases of polyarticular JIA, the most severely affected joint(s) are typically imaged to monitor for evidence of chronic changes indicative of disease progression, such as cyst formation, cartilage thinning, or bony erosions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Simultaneous imaging of the contralateral joint may be performed to allow for comparison of growth and development. Unilateral acceleration may be a sign of chronic inflammation associated with longstanding arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip pain of unclear etiology &ndash; In patients with hip pain of unclear etiology, ultrasonography or MRI is particularly useful in detecting the presence or absence of a joint effusion or a structural problem such as avascular necrosis or slipped upper femoral epiphysis. An effusion associated with severe pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever suggests septic arthritis of the hip.

MRI may be useful in identifying the presence of infectious arthritis and especially osteomyelitis with bone and marrow involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, inflammatory arthritis and septic arthritis without bone involvement may have similar MRI findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septic arthritis versus osteomyelitis &ndash; Technetium bone scans can be helpful in differentiating septic arthritis from osteomyelitis when the clinical examination is not helpful in distinguishing between the two. Osteomyelitis typically presents with isolated bone pain and fever, while septic arthritis presents with severe joint pain, highly restricted range of joint movement, and swelling as well as fever. However, osteomyelitis is occasionally associated with a sterile &quot;sympathetic&quot; effusion of the adjacent joint. The two conditions may coexist, particularly in joints where the metaphysis is within the joint capsule (such as the ankle in prepubertal children). The extent of bone involvement in osteomyelitis can be evaluated by MRI, but MRI is not always available and may be difficult to perform without general anesthesia in a young child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of skeletal tumors or trauma in patients with localized bone pain and no clear etiology &ndash; Bone scans are also used for detecting unsuspected skeletal trauma and tumors, such as osteoid osteoma, which may present with localized bone pain, especially at night. Perhaps the most common use of bone scans is attempting to localize symptoms in a nonacute situation when the source or location of the patient's pain remains unclear after the clinical examination. However, imaging is seldom as useful as the examination of an experienced practitioner since bone scans primarily detect abnormal tracer uptake by osteoblasts, a type of cell not affected by potential causes of joint symptoms. Thus, referral to a pediatric rheumatologist or orthopedist prior to obtaining a bone scan in these patients is advised.

However, this is not a sensitive or specific enough test to use for general screening purposes. Most children with JIA have negative autoantibody tests, and many healthy children have low titers of ANA not associated with pathology. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) are markers for potentially more severe disease and poor outcome in JIA but should only be performed in patients with an established diagnosis of JIA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 for children suspected of having certain forms of arthritis. While the presence of this antigen is associated with an increased risk of enthesitis-related arthritis, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and reactive arthritis, it is a poor general screening test. Nine percent of Caucasians carry this gene and are almost all healthy and never develop arthritis, while there are others (especially those of African descent) who do not have HLA-B27 but still go on to develop ankylosing spondylitis and related conditions in association with different genetic markers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for joint pain and swelling is broad, ranging from benign to serious conditions, some of which can have devastating consequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57734 \">table 1</a>).
