Symptom duration is one factor distinguishing brief psychotic disorder from schizophreniform disorder (one to six months) and schizophrenia (at least six months). Other disorders with psychotic features in the differential diagnosis include affective disorders, substance-induced disorders, psychosis due to a general medical condition and psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS). </p><p>This topic discusses brief psychotic disorder.

In the World Health Organization Determinants of Outcome Study based on 444 first-onset non-affective psychosis cases drawn from sites in eight countries, the incidence of non-affective acute remitting psychoses were approximately 10 times higher in the two developing country sites that the six industrialized sites.

The actual prevalence of such events in the life histories of patients with DSM-IV brief psychotic disorders has not been systematically investigated.

This finding may be related to higher prevalence rates of the disorder observed in undeveloped countries (described above). Another hypothesized contributing factor is heightened stress associated with discrimination and social adversity that many immigrants experience.

Implications of these findings for brief psychotic disorder remain unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651823\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many cases of psychosis in the postpartum period meet diagnostic criteria for brief psychotic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. DSM-5 criteria allow for specification of a subtype &ldquo;with postpartum onset&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Hallucinations can be auditory, visual, somatic, olfactory, or gustatory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delusions &ndash; A fixed, false belief. Delusions can be bizarre or non-bizarre.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorganized speech &ndash; Disorganized speech patterns reflect disruption in the organization of person&rsquo;s thoughts. Commonly observed forms include tangentiality and circumstantiality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorganized behavior &ndash; A patient with grossly disorganized behavior is often recognized by their inability to complete daily, normative tasks (eg, clothed, clean, belongings in order). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863609277\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little systematic data on the age of onset of brief psychotic disorder. The average age at onset has been found to vary widely in other psychotic conditions with a remitting course and acute onset, though may be somewhat higher than the age at onset of schizophrenia (late teens and early 20s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/7,15,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,26-28</a>].</p><p>Assessment of duration of the natural history of brief psychotic disorder is often complicated by early treatment which can lead to remission of psychotic symptoms. There has been little study of untreated individuals with the disorder. Symptoms of brief psychotic disorder, by definition, remit within a month based on DSM-5 criteria. </p><p>Many individuals who initially met criteria for a brief psychotic disorder have gone on to meet criteria for other psychotic disorders or affective disorders with psychosis. In the Suffolk County Study of first-admission psychosis, only three of the 11 patients who met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for brief psychotic disorder at six months maintained the diagnosis at two-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Three other patients received diagnoses of a mood disorder, two with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder, and three others with other disorders including psychotic disorder, NOS. In a study of first episode psychosis in Ireland, only 2 of 10 patients initially diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder maintained this diagnosis six years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>A study based on registry data from Denmark identified evidence of excess mortality both from natural causes and suicide in patients initially recorded as having acute and transient psychotic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1301119621\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive clinical assessment of a patient presenting with new onset of psychosis includes a careful history and physical examination, exclusion of general medical and substance-related causes of psychosis, and assessment for co-occurring conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Information from the patient&rsquo;s family and friends can be helpful in assessing the patient&rsquo;s functioning prior the onset of illness and to determine whether the patient&rsquo;s symptoms occurred prior to or following an associated stressor. </p><p>In addition to the symptoms comprising diagnostic criteria for brief psychotic disorder assessment, the patient should be evaluated for other features suggestive of brief psychotic disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of marked stressors preceding symptom onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of negative symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion during the early course of illness </p><p/><p>Diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires ongoing, longitudinal assessment of the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. Because the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria require remission within one month, the diagnosis is initially provisional or made retrospectively. Psychotic symptoms often recur subsequent to remission, in some cases leading to a final diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863609284\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for brief psychotic disorder are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of one or more of the following symptoms:&nbsp;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delusions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hallucinations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Disorganized speech </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least a day but less than a month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of symptoms comprising a mood disorder, or psychosis resulting from substance <span class=\"nowrap\">use/withdrawal</span> or a general medical condition</p><p/><p>Subtypes of the disorder include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With marked stressor &ndash; Symptoms are preceded by and apparently in response to a markedly stressful experience.

In their absence, our recommendations are based on our clinical experience and evidence on effective treatment for other psychotic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-psychotic-disorder/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>We suggest treatment of brief psychotic disorder with antipsychotic medication. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> can be started at 1 to 2 mg per day and increased to 2 to 3 mg per day over a week. The dose can be increased over the next one to two weeks based on clinical response and side effects to a maximum 8 mg per day. There are no known differences in the effectiveness of antipsychotic medications (other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, described separately). Medication selection is typically based on the drug&rsquo;s side effect profiles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guidelines for prescribing clozapine in schizophrenia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Anticholinergic medications may be needed for management of extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic medications. Benzodiazepines can be useful for treating agitation seen in some cases of brief psychotic disorder; for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> can be started at 0.25 mg twice daily, and increased as needed based on clinical response and the emergence of sedation and other side effects, up to a maximum of 2 mg twice daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no widely accepted guidelines on the duration of treatment for brief psychotic disorder. Based on our clinical experience, for a patient with brief psychotic disorder and no prior history of psychosis or an affective disorder, we suggest continuing antipsychotic treatment for one to three months following remission of symptoms. In discontinuing the medication, taper the dose over one to two weeks. During this time and over the weeks that follow, monitor the patient closely for signs of relapse. Longer treatment may be needed if mild or residual psychotic symptoms persist. </p><p>Switching to another antipsychotic medication should be considered if the psychotic symptoms do not respond to the first antipsychotic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-atypical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Close monitoring of symptoms and functioning during and in the early months after stopping treatment is recommended.</p><p>The patient who experiences residual psychotic symptoms for more than one month or experiences a relapse of full-blown symptoms soon after stopping medication will require further evaluation and reconsideration of the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder.

Further information may help to identify earlier episodes of psychosis or an affective disorder, allowing for refinement of the diagnosis and, possibly, the need for additional treatment (eg, continuation of antipsychotic medication, or treatment with an antidepressant or mood stabilizer).

Based on clinical experience, we suggest the use of supportive psychotherapy techniques for patients who find the acute onset of psychotic symptoms to be frightening. These techniques include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explaining the experience in medical terms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Describing treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing reassurance to the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> relatives and friends</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1301122871\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brief psychotic disorder is defined in DSM-5 as the presence of one or more psychotic symptoms with a sudden onset, absence of a mood or substance-induced disorder, and remission within one month. An overlapping category of syndromes in the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> edition), acute and transient psychotic disorders, applies to psychoses with an acute onset and a duration of one to three months depending on subtype. (See <a href=\"#H1301119190\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brief psychotic disorder is rare. Limited epidemiologic data include an estimated prevalence of 0.05 percent in a population based study in Finland. A three year follow-up assessment of first-episode psychosis in the United Kingdom found an incidence rate for acute transient psychotic disorder of 1.4 per 100,000. (See <a href=\"#H863609256\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms seen in brief psychotic disorder include one or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized behavior. Symptoms may appear following a stressful life event. Negative symptoms may be less likely to be present than in other psychotic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H863609270\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive clinical assessment of a patient presenting with new onset of psychosis includes a careful history and physical examination, and assessment for co-occurring conditions. Diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires the presence of one or more psychotic symptoms lasting more than a day and less than one month, and exclusion of an affective disorder or a general-medical or substance-related cause of psychosis. (See <a href=\"#H1301119621\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H863609284\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment of psychosis in patients with brief psychotic disorder with an antipsychotic medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> at a daily dose of 1 to 3 mg. Education and reassurance may be a helpful adjunct to medication, particularly in patients who are confused or frightened by the onset of psychotic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H863609291\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient with brief psychotic disorder and no prior history of psychosis or an affective disorder, we suggest continuing antipsychotic treatment for one to three months following remission of symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Close monitoring of symptoms and functioning during and in the early months after stopping treatment is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H863609291\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Psychiatric Association.
