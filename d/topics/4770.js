Clinical syndromes related to this parasite include neurocysticercosis (NCC) and extraneural cysticercosis. NCC, in turn, is divided into parenchymal and extraparenchymal forms. Extraparenchymal forms include intraventricular, subarachnoid, spinal, and ocular disease. Treatment must be individualized based on the disease manifestations.</p><p>Guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of neurocysticercosis were published in 2018 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of cysticercosis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, transmission, prevention, clinical features, and diagnosis of cysticercosis and the life cycle of <em>T. solium</em> are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to treatment of tapeworm infection with <em>T. solium</em> is discussed in detail separately.

Viable cysticerci do not cause much inflammation in surrounding tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysticerci that enhance after contrast administration reflect degeneration. The cyst wall increases in density and is often accompanied by edema; such findings reflect the host inflammatory response against the parasite and are frequently associated with seizures. In many cases, enhancing cysticerci retain features of viable cysticerci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonviable cysticerci are solid, calcified nodular lesions (usually 2 to 4 mm in diameter; range 1 to 10 mm); they are usually nonenhancing but may be associated with perilesional edema in some cases. They are also associated with seizures.</p><p/><p>Cysticerci may be present in more than one anatomic site. In addition, cysticerci at different stages in their natural history may be present simultaneously; for example, at any one time, a patient may have some viable cysts, some enhancing cysts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> some calcified cysts.</p><p>In general, treatment should focus on the more severe manifestations of disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the manifestations with greatest likelihood response to therapy. For example, if a patient has intraventricular lesions with hydrocephalus as well as intraparenchymal disease, a number of interventions are needed (shunt, endoscopic removal, anti-inflammatory therapy, antiparasitic therapy, antiseizure drug therapy). The initial focus should be on management of obstructive hydrocephalus, which is a contraindication to antiparasitic therapy.</p><p>Issues related to radiographic findings are discussed further separately.

Inflammation around degenerating cysticerci in the eye (particularly in the setting of antiparasitic therapy) can threaten vision.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p>The initial approach to patients with NCC consists of managing acute symptoms such as increased intracranial pressure (via surgical intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticosteroids) and seizures (via antiseizure drug therapy), if present. Thereafter, a determination should be made regarding the approach to management of antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory therapy; clinical decisions should be tailored to individual patient circumstances, as discussed in the sections below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3008540741\"><span class=\"h2\">Managing elevated intracranial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> papilledema, and somnolence) associated with parenchymal disease may occur in the setting of diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging. Management of diffuse cerebral edema consists of corticosteroid therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) to reduce inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H2917573110\" class=\"local\">'Cysticercal encephalitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Causes of elevated intracranial pressure associated with extraparenchymal disease include obstructive hydrocephalus (associated with intraventricular disease) and communicating hydrocephalus (associated with subarachnoid disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of obstructive hydrocephalus usually consists of a surgical approach (via removal of an obstructing cysticercus or placement of an external ventricular drain or shunt).

Clinical syndromes related to this parasite include neurocysticercosis (NCC) and extraneural cysticercosis. NCC, in turn, is divided into parenchymal and extraparenchymal forms. Stages of cysticercosis include an initial (viable) phase, a degenerating (enhancing) phase, and a nonviable (calcified) phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F117224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117224 \">table 1</a>). Cysticerci may be present in more than one anatomic site, and cysticerci at different stages in their natural history may be present simultaneously. (See &#160;above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to initiation of therapy for cysticercosis, all patients should have an ophthalmologic examination to exclude ocular cysticercosis. In addition, patients who are likely to require prolonged corticosteroids should also undergo screening for latent tuberculosis infection as well as screening or empiric therapy for strongyloidiasis. (See <a href=\"#H3656940568\" class=\"local\">'Prior to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial approach to patients with NCC consists of managing acute symptoms, if present, such as increased intracranial pressure (via surgical intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticosteroids) and seizures (via antiseizure drug therapy). Thereafter, a determination should be made regarding the approach to management of antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory therapy; clinical decisions should be tailored to individual patient circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical management of parenchymal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiparasitic therapy is warranted for patients with viable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> degenerating cysts on neuroimaging (regardless of location). Antiparasitic therapy should not be administered to patients with untreated hydrocephalus, cysticercal encephalitis, or calcified lesions only. (See <a href=\"#H511111273\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selection of antiparasitic regimen depends on the burden of disease. For patients with one to two cysts, we treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a>. For treatment of patients with more than two cysts, we treat with albendazole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">praziquantel</a>. The duration of antiparasitic therapy is 10 to 14 days in most cases; patients with subarachnoid disease warrant an extended duration of antiparasitic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3776653286\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1170601420\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H956456277\" class=\"local\">'Communicating hydrocephalus due to subarachnoid disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroids should be administered concomitantly with antiparasitic therapy. The optimal regimen is uncertain; commonly used regimens include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) begun at least one day prior to antiparasitic therapy, continued for the duration of antiparasitic therapy, and followed by a rapid taper. (See <a href=\"#H4199100988\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive use with antiparasitic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up neuroimaging should be performed every six months following completion of antiparasitic therapy, until radiographic resolution. Patients with persistent lesions on follow-up imaging warrant a repeat course of antiparasitic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2946178573\" class=\"local\">'Repeat neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of antiseizure drug therapy is uncertain; many patients continue to have seizures following antiparasitic treatment. For patients with viable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple lesions, antiseizure drug therapy should be continued for at least 24 months. For patients with a single enhancing lesion, antiseizure drug therapy should be continued for six months after radiographic resolution of active infection.
