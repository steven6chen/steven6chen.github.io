With active intervention, most infants born at 26 weeks and above have a high likelihood of survival, and virtually none below 22 weeks will survive. The chance of survival thus increases dramatically over these few weeks, and this crucial time window may be considered the period of periviability. In addition to the high risk of death in the immediate newborn period, children born at the limit of viability have a high risk of permanent disability. An understanding of both of these risks is essential to parental counseling and decision-making, with regard to attempted resuscitation and provision of life-sustaining measures in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU).</p><p>Survival and morbidity of extremely preterm infants born below 26 weeks gestation will be reviewed. In addition, a management approach for infants born in the periviable period, based upon prognosis, will be presented. The management of pregnancies at or near the limit of viability is discussed separately.

These reports span time periods ranging from six months to six years between 1993 and 2014, and represent several large geographic areas in Western Europe, Japan, a network of tertiary level academic centers in the United States, and a population-based study of California. These data clearly demonstrated the rise of survival rate as GA increased from 22 to 25 weeks, as well as improvement in survival of periviable infants over the past two decades.</p><p>These publications and the changes in outcome emphasize the importance of basing discussions about delivery room management for periviable infants upon the latest available data. In addition, although these results highlight the impact of GA on viability, it is important to recognize that ascertaining an accurate GA is challenging. Thus, estimated GA alone may not truly reflect the prognosis.

This tool is not intended to be predictive of individual infant outcomes, but rather provides a range of possible outcomes based on patient characteristics, and is applicable only at birth. While it may prove helpful for parental counseling and clinical decision-making regarding resuscitation, this tool is not intended to be the sole basis for care decisions, so the clinician must consider other relevant factors when counseling parents regarding management decisions. Clinicians should consider whether other factors are present that could impact outcome, such as the negative effects of long-standing fetal compromise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maternal and fetal infection, and the potential positive effects of intensive intervention.

Little overall variation was noted among rates of cerebral palsy (CP) and cognitive scores &lt;70 on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC test) by week of gestation when the infants were evaluated at two to three years of age and again at five to six years of age. These findings demonstrate the impact of extreme prematurity on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome and suggest that GA had a greater impact upon outcome than do clinical practice differences.</p><p>A study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network reported the incidence of the composite outcomes of death, or any neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) and death, or profound impairment in the cohort of survivors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63848 \">table 3</a>), as well as the survival rate at 18 to 22 months corrected age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75260 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The survival and neurodevelopmental outcome data from this cohort of 22 to 25 week survivors were used to develop the above cited web-based tool. This tool provides an estimate of the risk of death, death or any impairment, and death or profound impairment. In this study, NDI was defined as a score of 70 or below on either the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) or the Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, moderate or severe CP, bilateral blindness, or bilateral hearing loss requiring amplification. Profound impairment was defined as a MDI or PDI &lt;50 or severe gross motor deficit requiring adult assistance to move.</p><p>Follow-up data from the Japanese Neonatal Research Network also demonstrated comparable results with patients born at 22 and 23 weeks gestation at higher risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63848 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this cohort, which had a higher survival rate than those from other countries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75260 \">table 1</a>), the rate of survival without impairment at 36 to 42 months chronological age was 12 and 20 percent for patients at 22 and 23 weeks gestation. (See <a href=\"#H191949546\" class=\"local\">'Impact of initial management'</a> below.)</p><p>A 2013 meta-analysis of the four- to eight-year neurodevelopmental outcomes of survivors born at 22 to 25 weeks gestation demonstrated that these children were at risk for developing moderate to severe impairment, and that the risk increases with decreasing GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, this systematic review was limited by the small number of patients born at 22 weeks gestation and the wide variation in clinical care. Thus, the authors correctly conclude these results cannot be used for clinical decision making for individual patients.</p><p>Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of extremely preterm (GA less than 25 weeks) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (BW below 1000 g) infants are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Extremely preterm infant'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1786232046\"><span class=\"h3\">Changes in survival rate without impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Along with the improved survival rates for periviable infants, survival without neurodevelopmental impairment has also increased. This was illustrated by a NICHD study of infants born at 11 centers that assessed survival and neurodevelopmental outcome of infants born at 22 to 24 weeks of gestation who were evaluated at 18 to 22 months of corrected age, across three consecutive birth-year epochs (2000 to 2003, 2004 to 2007, and 2008 to 2011) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Survival increased from 30 to 36 percent from the first to the third epochs. After adjusting for changes in baseline patient characteristics, survival without neurodevelopmental impairment compared with death increased from epoch 1 to epoch 3 (16 versus 20 percent; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.99), as did survival with neurodevelopmental impairment (15 versus 16 percent; adjusted RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.59). Although there was no change in outcomes among the infants born at 22 weeks gestation, the sample size for this gestational age group was small.</p><p>While this report shows that the increase in the rate of survival was not associated with a disproportionate increase in the rate of survival with neurodevelopmental impairment, the prognosis among periviable infants remains guarded. As data from the third epoch (2008 to 2011) demonstrated that 64 percent of the infants died, and 43 percent of survivors had neurodevelopmental impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8144872\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1927126462\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although critical decisions in the setting of extreme prematurity are particularly challenging, and in some ways unique, every facility that cares for high-risk pregnancies should have a consensus approach to the management of extremely preterm infants that is consistently used by all providers. These guidelines regarding management decisions need to be grounded in an understanding of the outcome data and must consider the relevant ethical issues. The rationale for a consensus approach includes practicality and consistency in the hospital setting, with multiple physicians providing and handing off care, as well as fairness and consistency when counseling parents. The benefit of consensus guidelines is also demonstrated by the results of a prospective study in which disagreement in the management approach of infants 23<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> to 26<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</sup></span> weeks gestation between obstetricians and neonatologists significantly increased the likelihood of death on the first day of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A literature review from a 2013 workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) found that the rates of neonatal survival and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) varied across periviable gestations and were influenced by obstetric and neonatal management choices (eg, antenatal steroids, tocolytic agents, antibiotic administration, cesarean birth, and local protocols for perinatal care, neonatal resuscitation, and intensive care support) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar findings were observed in a survey of ACOG members that reported on the impact of provider and institutional factors on counseling and decision making in the care of periviable pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The authors concluded that institutional policies and consensus guidelines related to periviable care should reduce practice variation.</p><p>In addition, the ACOG and SMFM have published consensus obstetric care guidelines about clinical management of pregnancies with threatened or imminent delivery at 20<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> to 25<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</sup></span> weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

For the majority of infants included in the above studies, GA was based on best obstetrical estimate, thus the estimated GA used for these databases could have a margin of error of up to two weeks. Similarly, in the clinical setting, the estimated GA of a given fetus can also be off by as much as two weeks, unless the fetus is a product of in vitro fertilization (in whom GA dating is accurate). Thus, an imminent delivery believed to be at 23 weeks could be under 22 weeks, with virtually no chance of survival, or more than 24 weeks, with a significantly better chance of survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, because fetuses mature at different rates with regard to external appearance, most postnatal assessment tools used are only accurate within one to two weeks gestation. Thus, it is not possible to accurately differentiate a child at 23 weeks from one at 22 or 24 weeks based on physical examination in the delivery room. The obstetrical estimate should be used when counseling parents or making decisions unless there is a profound discrepancy between physical appearance and the obstetrical estimate of GA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-assessment-of-gestational-age#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal assessment of gestational age&quot;, section on 'Methods of postnatal assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the method used to estimate GA, clinicians should recognize that, for most cases, there will be a margin of error in assigning GA. Thus, the GA should be considered as a range rather than a discrete number when used to predict the likelihood of survival for an extremely preterm infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191949546\"><span class=\"h4\">Impact of initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major issue with regard to predicted survival of periviable infants is the impact of initial management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. Interpretation of survival data should always take into account whether resuscitation was attempted, because the survival rate among centers, and even among developed nations, varies widely, largely depending on whether maximal resuscitative and obstetrical efforts were made. This was best illustrated in a NICHD multicenter study that showed that differences in practice regarding the initiation of active treatment for infants born below 24 weeks gestation accounted for three-quarters of the between-hospital variation in survival and survival without impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The relevant question regarding survival, when considering resuscitation decisions, is not whether the child would survive without resuscitation and intensive care, as survival would almost certainly be zero without these efforts for nearly all periviable infants. Rather, the relevant question is what the chance of survival would be if every effort were to be made, such as full resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. This point was illustrated by the use of NICHD outcome data that estimated a survival of 26 percent for all infants born at 23 weeks gestation, but an improved rate of 37 percent for those who were placed on mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While this might reflect the fact that some infants died before they could be placed on the ventilator, decisions to withhold mechanical ventilation in some cases probably contributed to the differences in survival, as demonstrated by the results from the NICHD study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, a Swedish study demonstrated that proactive perinatal care including both obstetrical and neonatal care decreased mortality for infants with a GA less than 27 weeks without increasing the risk of NDI at 2.5 years corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] </p><p>The impact of providing or withholding care is even more apparent when one considers survival below 23 weeks gestation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NICHD data related to extremely preterm infants born between 2003 and 2007 showed overall survival to be 6 percent for infants born at 22 weeks gestation, but resuscitation and ventilation were only attempted in 19 percent of these infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a large multicenter Japanese study from a similar time period, with a higher rate of attempting resuscitation at 22 weeks, reported a survival rate of 37 percent at the time of discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of the delivery room care in the EPIPAGE-2 study, intensive care was withheld for 96, 91, 38, and 8 percent of neonates at 22, 23, 24, and 25&#8197;weeks of gestation, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>Although it is not the intent of this discussion to comment on whether it is inappropriate to withhold resuscitation from infants with a GA of 22 weeks, data from these studies show that simply reporting survival rates for a given gestational age can be misleading.

In a publication from the NICHD network, data demonstrated a decrease in mortality for infants at 23 and 24 weeks gestation but not at 22 or 26 weeks gestation, and a reduction in several neonatal morbidities (eg, late onset sepsis and severe intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH]) from 1993 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These results were concomitant with changes in maternal and infant care practices (eg, increased use of antenatal corticosteroid therapy and cesarean delivery).</p><p>As a result, if care is to be provided to infants at 22 to 23 weeks gestation, we recommend antenatal corticosteroids should be administered to their mothers in preterm labor (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on 'Gestational age at administration'</a>). A cohort study of prospectively collected data on inborn infants with a birth weight (BW) between 401 and 1000 g born at 22 to 25 weeks gestation demonstrated that for infants at 23 to 25 weeks gestation, antenatal exposure to corticosteroids compared with nonexposure was associated with a significantly lower rate of death, death or selected neonatal morbidities, and death or NDI at 18 to 22 months corrected age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75260 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69552\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69552 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63848 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For infants at 22 weeks gestation, antenatal exposure to corticosteroids compared with nonexposure was only associated with a significantly lower rate of death or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Furthermore, another report has suggested that increased center rates of aggressive clinical management of pregnancies and infants at 22 to 24 weeks gestation, especially administration of antenatal corticosteroids, was associated with a lower mortality among 22 to 24 week infants and improved outcomes among 25 to 27 week infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Neurodevelopmental sequelae of extreme prematurity include cognitive impairment, cerebral palsy (CP), visual impairment, hearing impairment, and learning and behavioral difficulties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63848 \">table 3</a>). However, it is challenging to accurately predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for periviable survivors.</p><p>The data most commonly referenced for neurodevelopmental outcome and used in the NICHD outcome estimator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], are based on follow-up evaluations of survivors at 18 to 22 months corrected age. However, a study of preterm survivors (GA 22 to 27 weeks) from the Australian Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group reported a poor correlation between neurodevelopmental evaluation at two and eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Notably, evaluation at two years of age significantly overestimated the likelihood of moderate or severe disability at an older age, mostly due to differences in classification of cognitive disability between two and eight years of age.</p><p>Similar concerns about the predictive accuracy of testing at two years of age were noted in a study from a single center in the United States that observed a poor correlation between the test results of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II performed at 20 months corrected age and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) Mental Processing Composite at eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The rate of cognitive impairment was lower at school age than at 20 months corrected age (16 versus 39 percent). In the EPICure data from Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], 86 percent of survivors assessed as having severe disability at 30 months were assessed as having persistent moderate to severe disability at six years of age.</p><p>These results suggest there is a risk of overestimating long-term moderate or severe disability, particularly cognitive impairment, when assessing neurodevelopmental status at two to three years of age. As noted above, the NICHD outcome estimator is based on outcome data at 18 to 20 months corrected age, and this should be taken into account when utilizing this tool to predict long-term outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management#H363542892\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants: Management&quot;, section on 'Timing of clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8144893\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the many ethical issues at play in making management decisions for periviable infants, both in the delivery room and in the NICU, there is considerable debate among ethicists and clinicians regarding what role these issues should have in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>One way to approach ethical analysis (though certainly not the only way) is to consider relevant rights of the infant and the parents, and the obligations of the clinical team. Rights and obligations that we consider relevant to these decisions include, but may not be limited to, the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infant has a right to treatment, when feasible, that has a reasonable chance of saving his or her life. The infant also has a right to mercy, meaning a right not to be subjected to painful procedures that are extremely unlikely to benefit him or her (ie, improve survival <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease morbidity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The parents have a right to information they need to make informed decisions on their child's behalf. They have a right to decide what is done to their child, but that may, in rare situations, be overridden by the child's rights (eg, if they refuse a treatment that clearly would benefit the infant, or demand one that clearly would be harmful to their child).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians have an obligation to present parents with the relevant information, such as morbidity and mortality data (as well as the limitations of those data), and to help them with the profoundly difficult decisions for the care of this age group. An honest presentation of the relevant information and the available options (including, if feasible, transfer to another institution) is paramount. The clinical team should recognize the enormous stress that decision making in this setting causes parents, and work closely with them to reach management decisions together, based primarily on an assessment of the perceived benefits and burdens to the infant of treatments under consideration. In rare circumstances, the clinical team may determine that parental preferences are clearly opposed to the child's interests, in which case those decisions may need to be overridden, by use of proper procedural channels as time allows.</p><p/><p>Two other important ethical issues to consider are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal of treatment &ndash; A central question with regard to intensive care measures for patients of all ages is the ethical permissibility of withdrawing life-sustaining treatments once they have been initiated. In particular, in the earlier years of mechanical ventilation, some felt that it would be impermissible to withdraw mechanical ventilation once begun. At this point there is a consensus among intensivists, neonatologists, and medical ethicists that this is not the case. If, for a given clinical situation and prognosis, it would be permissible not to intubate, then it would also be permissible to extubate and withdraw mechanical ventilation. Thus, an initial decision to resuscitate and initiate intensive care measures may be reversible, and parents should be made aware of this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Justice &ndash; A central ethical principle when making resuscitation decisions, or resuscitation policies, is justice. Justice requires us to treat people equally unless there is a relevant difference between them. It is recognized that what is feasible in one setting may not be feasible in another, and this could influence what options are offered to parents. However, within a given institution, if two infants are believed to have similar prognoses, it would be inappropriate to give one family a choice regarding attempted resuscitation of their infant, but tell another that they have no choice (ie, either resuscitation is obligatory, or not an option). To treat them differently requires a relevant difference, and that difference should be prognosis. What is offered should be based primarily on prognosis, as well as feasibility. The &quot;relevant difference&quot; that permits offering an option to one family but not another in the same setting should generally be a difference in prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Traditionally, prognosis has been estimated prior to birth primarily by using GA. However, the data from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network clearly show that we can be more precise in predictions by also incorporating such factors as gender, weight, antenatal steroids, and singleton versus multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, a larger female infant will sometimes have a better prognosis than a smaller male who is a week further along in gestation. Basing our approach to parental counseling with regard to available options on GA alone predisposes our management to injustice. (See <a href=\"#H8144843\" class=\"local\">'Other factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Based on the above ethical approach and considerations, periviable infants can be assigned to one of three management categories for resuscitative and intensive care based on prognosis with regard to mortality and morbidity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis is so poor that the infant should not be made to undergo any resuscitative and intensive care measures. In this case, these procedures would be ethically impermissible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis is so good that resuscitative and intensive care measures should be provided, at least initially, and are ethically obligatory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis is unclear and it is difficult to determine the relative benefit and burden of resuscitative and intensive care measures for the infant. In this setting, clinicians should generally defer to the values and preferences of informed parents. Attempted resuscitation in this setting could be considered ethically permissible, but not obligatory.</p><p/><p>Defining the boundaries of these three categories, of course, is difficult. Various professional organizations, as shown below, have provided guidelines regarding management decisions and when physicians should defer to parental judgment.</p><p>While some physicians (and some earlier societal guidelines) have suggested possible deviation from an agreed-upon plan made with parents, based on the appearance of the newborn at delivery, this is not here recommended. There are no data to support the predictive value of such an assessment. Deviating from a plan agreed upon with the parents is only appropriate if information becomes available in the delivery room that significantly alters the previously discussed prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8144900\"><span class=\"h2\">Professional standards and recommendations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26390972\"><span class=\"h3\">American societies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have stated that if the physician believes there is no chance of survival for a given infant, then attempted resuscitation offers no benefit to the infant and should not be initiated. They suggest that one example of this may be confirmed gestational age of less than 22 weeks. Moreover, they state that if there is agreement between parents and caregivers that intensive measures will not improve the chance of survival, or pose an unacceptable burden to the child, then those measures can be withheld. They state that examples of this may include birth between 22 and 24 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>A consensus statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine does not recommend neonatal resuscitation below 22 weeks gestation and resuscitation should be considered in consultation with parents for births between 22 and &lt;24 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn (COFN) revised guidelines for antenatal counseling regarding resuscitation at extremely low GA suggest that predictions provided to parents facing resuscitation decisions should not be based on gestational age <strong>alone</strong>, but need to take into account relevant maternal and fetal factors, as well as parental choice and values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periviable-birth-limit-of-viability/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The following conclusions were included in these guidelines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint discussion with the parents and members of the obstetric and neonatal teams prior to high-risk birth (if possible) to promote optimal decision making. Care providers need to consider the ability of parents to understand the clinical situation, including language proficiency, and need to understand cultural and religious factors that affect the parents' values and choices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although fetal GA is an imprecise predictor of neonatal survival, 22 weeks gestation is generally accepted as the lower threshold of viability. Comfort care should be provided for all cases below 22 weeks gestation at birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants from 22 to 24 weeks gestation will either die in the neonatal period or have significant NDI. However, outcomes for individual cases are difficult to predict and outcomes vary from center to center. As a result, it is reasonable that decision making regarding resuscitative efforts be individualized and family centered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each center should develop a policy and procedures for the management of extremely preterm infants that is consistently used by all providers.
