These disorders include focal cerebral injury due to arterial ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Perinatal stroke is a common cause of acute neonatal encephalopathy, and may manifest as seizures, altered mental status, and sensorimotor deficits. It is an important cause of chronic neurologic disability.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of perinatal stroke are reviewed here.

The mechanism may be retrograde thrombosis of the venous system following occlusion of the right internal jugular vein by the ECMO catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhagic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhagic stroke refers to acute neurologic syndromes resulting from intracranial hemorrhage of nontraumatic origin.

Most cases of primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage are idiopathic, but some are attributed to bleeding diatheses (eg, thrombocytopenia, hemophilia, and other coagulopathies) or, rarely, to vascular anomalies (eg, cavernous malformations, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms).</p><p>Periventricular hemorrhagic infarction is particularly common in premature infants. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Periventricular hemorrhagic infarction'</a> below.)</p><p>There are limited data regarding hemorrhagic stroke in newborns. In a cohort of over 323,000 live births in northern California from 1993 to 2003, a retrospective review identified 20 cases of perinatal hemorrhagic stroke, including 19 with intracerebral hemorrhage and one with subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiologies included thrombocytopenia (20 percent) and cavernous malformation (5 percent), but most were idiopathic (75 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each of the 20 cases was randomly matched with three controls by age and birth facility. On univariate case-control analysis, the predictors of perinatal hemorrhage were fetal distress, emergency cesarean delivery, prematurity, and postmaturity but not birth weight. Maternal characteristics did not differ between cases and controls. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of perinatal hemorrhage were fetal distress and postmaturity.</p><p/><p>A subsequent population-based, case-control study from Alberta, Canada identified 86 cases of neonatal hemorrhagic stroke and matched them with control infants in a 4 to 1 ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The following outcomes were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 86 cases, primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage accounted for 59 percent, hemorrhagic transformation for 35 percent, and presumed perinatal hemorrhagic stroke for 6 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 51 cases of primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage, most were idiopathic (67 percent).</p><p/><p>As these findings illustrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], no definitive cause can be determined for many cases of primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and this problem may persist even after extensive evaluation. For example, the location or size of a hemorrhage may be suggestive of an arteriovascular malformation or aneurysm, but the anomaly may not be demonstrated by imaging, perhaps because it is obliterated as a result of the hemorrhage.</p><p>Additional risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), coarctation of the aorta with or without hypertension, venous thrombosis, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin K</a> deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,42-44</a>].

However, PVL also may result from injury due to other causes, such as infection or cytokine exposure.

This typically evolves to spastic diplegia later in infancy. Hemorrhagic PVL, unlike middle cerebral artery territory lesions, frequently involves the legs more than the arms and face, except in very extensive lesions. Hemorrhagic PVL is usually on the left side, or is worse on the left than the right side.</p><p>The prognosis for infants with PVL depends upon the location and extent of the injury.

A population-based study from Switzerland with prospectively-collected data found that the incidence of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke was 13 per 100,000 births, or 1 per 7700 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, there are few population-based prospective studies of the incidence of perinatal stroke in the MRI era, and estimates relying on diagnostic code searches of administrative databases grossly underestimate the incidence. More accurate estimates may be obtained from expanded and verifiable search strategies designed to capture both acutely symptomatic neonates and infants with presumed perinatal ischemic stroke. Studies employing such methods suggest that the combined incidence of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage in North America is approximately 45 per 100,000 live births annually, or 1 per 2200 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,55</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective population-based cohort study identified 60 children with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke born between 1997 and 2003 in Northern California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

The diagnosis of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is confirmed by cranial MRI or CT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55919\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55919 \">image 1</a>). These studies define the extent and vascular territory of the infarct, the number of lesions, and the presence or absence of hemorrhage.

MRI, especially when used with venography (MRV), has greater sensitivity and specificity to detect venous and sinus thrombosis than CT or Doppler ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>MRI is superior to CT, as it lacks radiation exposure and may detect small or early infarcts that are not apparent on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,71</a>]. However, MRI sometimes cannot be obtained in the ill neonate because it requires more preparation and a longer scanning time than CT. Cranial ultrasonography, the primary imaging technique used to detect intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia, is less useful for detecting ischemic stroke because of the peripheral location of most infarcts.</p><p>Early infarction can be visualized with MRI using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before the lesion can be seen with conventional MRI or CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. This technique is based upon the decrease in the rate of diffusion of water molecules that occurs within minutes after an ischemic insult. The decreased rate of diffusion is detected as a bright signal on DWI that is thought to reflect cytotoxic edema or necrosis.

In a multicenter cohort study of 248 infants with acute symptomatic perinatal ischemic stroke, vascular imaging using MRA was obtained in 49 percent, compared with CT angiography and catheter angiography in 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Vascular abnormalities, including large vessel occlusions, dissection, and congenital vasculopathies, were seen in 22 percent of those imaged. Note that thrombotic occlusions of large cerebral arteries can move rapidly to distal branches and thus may not always be apparent on imaging performed many hours or days after the occlusion occurs, as is usually the case with perinatal stroke.

In these cases, a comprehensive, expedited evaluation should be performed to exclude other etiologies of seizures, including systemic infection. The diagnosis of neonatal seizures is based upon clinical observation combined with electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Studies should include a complete blood count with leukocyte differential, examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cultures of the blood and CSF. Serum concentrations of glucose, calcium, and electrolytes should be measured, and the urine should be screened for toxic substances. Studies to detect inborn errors of metabolism may be indicated in some circumstances (eg, persistent seizures).
