failure, or diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Obesity-related complications (including diabetic nephropathy, heart failure, and cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) commonly coexist as causes of ascites. Patients with more than one cause for ascites formation are often the most difficult to diagnose because each partial cause may not be severe enough in-and-of itself to lead to fluid retention; it is the combination of partial causes that leads to ascites formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25272225\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ascites typically have abdominal distension that may be associated with symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath, and weight gain.

The time course over which the distension develops depends on the etiology of the ascites. It may develop over the course of days (eg, bloody ascites due to trauma) or months (eg, malignant ascites). Patients may also complain of weight gain, shortness of breath, early satiety, and dyspnea resulting from fluid accumulation and increased abdominal pressure. Patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may also have symptoms such as fever, abdominal tenderness, and altered mental status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with cirrhosis may have other symptoms associated with hepatic decompensation, such as confusion or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with malignant ascites may have symptoms related to the underlying malignancy, such as weight loss, whereas patients with ascites due to heart failure may report dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema. Patients with chylous ascites may report diarrhea and steatorrhea, malnutrition, edema, nausea, enlarged lymph nodes, early satiety, fevers, and night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].

Patients may also have shifting dullness (a change in the location of dullness to percussion when the patient is turned), a fluid wave, and evidence of pleural effusions (eg, decreased breath sounds or dullness to percussion). Patients may also have physical examination findings related to the underlying cause of the ascites, such as stigmata of cirrhosis.</p><p>Almost all patients with cirrhosis severe enough to lead to ascites formation have stigmata of cirrhosis on physical examination. Stigmata that suggest the presence of cirrhosis include spider angioma, palmar erythema, and abdominal wall collaterals. Spider angiomata are most apparent on the face, neck, shoulders, and upper chest, and are unusual below the umbilicus. The palmar erythema of cirrhosis is &quot;blotchy&quot; and most prominent on the hypothenar eminence and next most prominent on the thenar eminence, with sparing of the center of the palm. However, spider angiomata and palmar erythema may be difficult to detect in patients with dark skin. Abdominal wall collaterals are most apparent starting at the umbilicus and extending cephalad. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with advanced liver disease also have jaundice, muscle wasting, gynecomastia, and leukonychia (white nails). The liver and spleen may be palpable. Parotid enlargement may be present but is probably due to alcohol and not cirrhosis per se. </p><p>An umbilical nodule that is not bowel or omentum (ie, a Sister Mary Joseph nodule) provides evidence for cancer as the cause of ascites. Gastric cancer, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, or lymphoma can cause ascites accompanied by an umbilical nodule.</p><p>If the ascites is the result of heart failure, physical examination findings may include jugular venous distension, pulmonary congestion, or peripheral edema. An elevated jugular venous pressure suggests that heart failure or constrictive pericarditis may be the cause (or at least one cause) of ascites. On the other hand, cirrhosis in the absence of tense ascites, pulmonary hypertension, or renal insufficiency is associated with low or normal cardiac filling pressures and no jugular venous distension.

Patients with cirrhosis or heart failure may have abnormal liver tests and evidence of renal failure. Patients with cirrhosis may also have an elevated international normalized ratio, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukopenia. Patients who have developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may have a leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and azotemia.

Once the diagnosis of ascites is made, the next step is to look for the cause. This typically includes a paracentesis to evaluate the ascitic fluid. (See <a href=\"#H56451750\" class=\"local\">'Determining the cause of the ascites'</a> below.)</p><p>A grading system for ascites has been proposed by the International Ascites Club [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Mild ascites detectable only by ultrasound examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 &ndash; Moderate ascites manifested by moderate symmetrical distension of the abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; Large or gross ascites with marked abdominal distension</p><p/><p>However, the validity of the grading system has not yet been established. In particular, the natural history of &quot;grade 1&quot; ascites is unclear. An older system that grades ascites from 1+ to 4+ is also used. In this system 1+ is minimal and barely detectable, 2+ is moderate, 3+ is massive but not tense, and 4+ is massive and tense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341237938\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites is frequently suspected based upon the history and physical examination. The most helpful physical finding in confirming the presence of ascites is flank dullness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. When flank dullness is detected, it is useful to see if it shifts with rotation of the patient (ie, shifting dullness). </p><p>However, the accuracy of physical findings is variable depending in part upon the amount of fluid present, the technique used to examine the patient, and the clinical setting (eg, detection may be more difficult in patients who are obese). In a study comparing various physical findings with ultrasound as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the physical examination for detecting ascites ranged from 50 to 94 percent and 29 to 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having ascites based on history and physical examination should undergo imaging to confirm the presence of ascites and to look for evidence of cirrhosis or malignancy. Ultrasound is probably the most cost-effective modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Another advantage of ultrasound is that it involves no radiation or intravenous access, and no risk of contrast allergy or nephropathy. If a computed tomographic (CT) scan is performed, ascites is easily seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77598\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77598 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The usual liver ultrasound focuses attention on the gallbladder and does not examine the spleen. Specifically ordering a &quot;liver and spleen ultrasound&quot; or an &quot;upper abdominal ultrasound&quot; is more likely to provide the needed information. The details of the ordering should be coordinated with the local imaging team. </p><p>In patients with cirrhosis, ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal evidence of a nodular liver. Ultrasound findings in patients with portal hypertension may include dilation of the portal vein to &ge;13 mm, dilation of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins to &ge;11 mm, reduction in portal venous blood flow velocity, splenomegaly (diameter &gt;12 cm), and recanalization of the umbilical vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

When there is high suspicion of tuberculous peritonitis, peritoneoscopy with mycobacterial culture and histology of a biopsied tubercle is the most rapid route to the diagnosis.

Adenosine deaminase activity of ascitic fluid has been proposed as a useful non-culture method of detecting tuberculous peritonitis; however, patients with tuberculous peritonitis who also have cirrhosis usually have falsely low values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This test is useful in countries such as India, but it is of very limited utility in the United States because most patients in the United States with tuberculous peritonitis also have cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytology</strong> &ndash; Almost 100 percent of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis will have positive ascitic fluid cytology due to the presence of viable malignant cells exfoliating into the ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, only about two-thirds of patients with malignancy-related ascites have peritoneal carcinomatosis. The remaining patients have massive liver metastases, chylous ascites due to lymphoma, or hepatocellular carcinoma; these patients usually have negative cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As a result, the overall sensitivity of cytology smears for the detection of malignant ascites is 58 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].

Other common causes of ascites include malignancy-related ascites and ascites due to heart failure. Approximately 5 percent of patients will have two or even three causes for ascites formation. (See <a href=\"#H25272217\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ascites typically report progressive abdominal distension that may be painless or associated with abdominal discomfort. The time course over which the distension develops depends upon the etiology of the ascites. It may develop over the course of days (eg, bloody ascites due to trauma) or months (eg, malignant ascites). Patients may also complain of weight gain, shortness of breath, early satiety, and dyspnea resulting from fluid accumulation and increased abdominal pressure. (See <a href=\"#H341237666\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ascites, regardless of the etiology, will typically have flank dullness on examination. Other findings include shifting dullness (a change in location of dullness to percussion when the patient is turned due to movement of the ascites), a fluid wave, and evidence of pleural effusions (eg, decreased breath sounds or dullness to percussion). Patients may also have physical examination findings related to the underlying cause of the ascites, such as stigmata of cirrhosis.
