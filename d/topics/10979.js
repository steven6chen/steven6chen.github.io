Iron overload is not just limited to the liver, but can also accumulate in other organs, particularly the heart and endocrine organs, resulting in end-organ damage and dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hemosiderosis is a commonly used term for iron accumulation in tissues from any cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Excess oxygen radicals and injury from tissue peroxidation are the main reasons why iron overload causes tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Reducing the degree of iron overload is therefore paramount for most of these diseases to achieve successful treatment. Assessment of total body iron stores can be used to tailor titration of chelation therapy or phlebotomy in an attempt to reduce iron overload and its attendant complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Phlebotomy has been shown to slow the progression to cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis, and it also reduces the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The complications of fibrosis and cirrhosis developing in patients increase when there is significant iron overload, which is defined as hepatic iron concentration (HIC) greater than three times the upper limit of normal (greater than 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g</span> dry weight). Liver fibrosis may be reversible with phlebotomy therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In the past, the diagnosis for hereditary hemochromatosis was based on results of liver biopsy specimens and hepatic iron content and distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Since the discovery of the <em>HFE</em> gene mutation (substitution by tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid 282; C282Y) and two other genetic mutations (aspartate for histidine [H63D] and cysteine for serine [S65C]), the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis has become more straightforward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tests for the <em>HFE</em> gene are performed when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are elevated. However, a small number of individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis may be missed with these genetic tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additionally, phenotypic penetrance in hereditary hemochromatosis is variable with regard to the degree of iron overload and the risk of liver disease, fibrosis, and cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a result, a positive genetic test does not ensure that iron overload had developed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H3730936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Making the diagnosis of HH'</a>.)</p><p>Determination of the HIC is the most definitive proof of iron overload. It can be used to estimate the total iron burden and the approximate amount of phlebotomy required for a patient with iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. The HIC can also detect mild iron overload, which may be missed with less sensitive modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An elevated serum ferritin level alone is often not adequate for estimating total iron burden, particularly if coexisting inflammation is present. The hepatic iron index is calculated based on the HIC and in the past was used to make a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis; however, most patients can now be diagnosed by genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the tests that can be done to determine hepatic iron content, with a focus on the HIC.

However, patients with hereditary hemochromatosis may undergo a liver biopsy to determine the severity of liver disease, in which case the HIC can also be determined to estimate total iron stores. Patients with a serum ferritin &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/L</span> are at particular risk of advanced fibrosis and may benefit from a staging liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>].

However, alternative tests to determine hepatic iron stores (such as magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are less invasive. The HIC correlates well with T2-weighted MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but studies suggest that the sensitivity of MRI is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], so if the suspicion for iron overload is high but an MRI is negative, calculation of the HIC may still be needed.

AAS is the biochemical assay considered to be the reference method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Dry liver weight taken from FFPE tissue, particularly when the dry weight is &ge;0.4 mg, is as accurate as fresh tissue.

The Prussian blue stain will highlight the degree and pattern of distribution of iron deposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103742\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103742 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Early in the course of hereditary hemochromatosis, there is a decreasing gradient of parenchymal iron distribution from periportal to centrilobular areas (seen in &gt;93 percent of patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105340 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The pattern is not specific for the C282Y <em>HFE</em> gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Several scoring systems for hepatic iron deposition have been developed. Although not validated, the most commonly used are the Scheuer method and its modified version because of their simplicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The score is based on the percentage of hepatocytes with iron, and ranges from 0 to 4. Other scoring systems that have been developed are the Deugnier and Turlin, Rowe, Sindram and Marx, Conn, and Brissot systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Deugnier's histological scoring system correlates with measurement of the HIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There is also a modification of the histological scoring system for iron overload by Sindram and Marx that includes the size of iron granules to reach a final score. When this system was used in one study, there was a strong correlation between histologic score and HIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29216850\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role for hepatic iron concentration (HIC) and hepatic iron index (HII) determination has greatly diminished since genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis has become widely available. Determining the HIC is rarely needed to make a definitive diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. However, patients with hereditary hemochromatosis may undergo liver biopsy to determine the severity of liver disease, in which case the HIC can also be determined to estimate total iron stores. The HIC appears to be a reliable indicator of whole liver iron concentration, provided an adequate sample is available (&ge;1 mg dry weight). (See <a href=\"#H29216767\" class=\"local\">'Indications for determining the HIC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining the HIC can also be used for a patient with a suspected genetic iron overload disorder but negative testing for the common genetic mutations: C282Y, H63D, and S65C. However, alternative tests to determine hepatic iron stores (such as magnetic resonance imaging) are less invasive. (See <a href=\"#H29216767\" class=\"local\">'Indications for determining the HIC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HIC is usually reported as micrograms of iron per gram of dry liver weight. The value is then converted to micromoles of iron per gram by dividing by 56, which is the molecular weight of iron. (See <a href=\"#H29216774\" class=\"local\">'Measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The severity of iron overload can be classified as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild: HIC &gt;70 to &lt;99 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g</span> dry weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate: HIC 99 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g</span> dry weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe: HIC &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g</span> dry weight </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HII is calculated from the HIC by dividing the quantitative iron in micromoles per gram of dry weight by the patient's age. Prior to the discovery of the <em>HFE</em> gene mutation, an HII of &gt;1.9 was considered to be diagnostic for hereditary hemochromatosis. However, the HII can be elevated even in patients without the <em>HFE</em> genetic mutation. (See <a href=\"#H29216809\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic iron index'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other methods to evaluate iron overload include serum iron indices, magnetic resonance imaging, and histologic evaluation of liver biopsy specimens. (See <a href=\"#H29216822\" class=\"local\">'Other methods to determine iron overload'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29216952\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Bruce Bacon, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-determine-hepatic-iron-content/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brissot P, Troadec MB, Bardou-Jacquet E, et al.
