The most common indication for endotracheal intubation of a pregnant patient is emergency cesarean delivery due to a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional indications include a failed regional technique prior to a cesarean delivery, a high block from a neuraxial anesthetic, local anesthetic (LA) systemic toxicity, respiratory and neurologic emergencies, and maternal cardiac arrest. This topic will discuss airway management of pregnant women at delivery, with a focus on management of the difficult airway. Other anesthetic considerations for cesarean delivery, and for pregnant women undergoing non-obstetric surgery, are discussed elsewhere.

Although a similar proportion of the general surgical population (5.8 percent) has difficult intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the consequences of difficult intubation can be greater in the obstetric population.</p><p>Failed intubation is much less common than difficult intubation, but it occurs much more frequently in obstetric patients than in surgical patients. Several observational studies of obstetric patients have reported failed intubation rates of 0.26 to 0.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/6,8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-13</a>]. In contrast, in a retrospective study of 13,380 surgical patients, only 0.045 percent had failed intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95478368\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anesthesia-related mortality in obstetric patients is most often due to respiratory events. Respiratory problems occur not just during induction of general anesthesia, but also at emergence and recovery, or in relation to regional anesthetic complications (eg, high spinal anesthesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis comparing anesthesia-related maternal deaths in the United States from 1991 to 1996 with those from 1997 to 2002, while cesarean fatality rates under general anesthesia fell (from 16.8 to 6.5 per million) and those under regional anesthesia rose (from 2.5 to 3.8 per million), respiratory issues remained prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, the leading causes of anesthesia-related pregnancy deaths for 1991 to 2002 were induction problems or intubation failure (23 percent), respiratory failure (20 percent), and high spinal or epidural block (16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the state of Michigan from 1985 to 2003, 8 of 855 pregnancy-associated deaths were anesthesia-related, and seven were anesthesia-contributing; none of these occurred at induction of general anesthesia, but five resulted from hypoventilation or airway obstruction during emergence, extubation, or recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health report for 2006 to 2008 in the United Kingdom attributed seven deaths directly to anesthesia; of these, two deaths were from failure to ventilate the lungs upon induction of anesthesia, and two resulted from postoperative airway complications: opioid-induced respiratory arrest during patient-controlled analgesia and aspiration following extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>A review of the literature on obstetric failed intubations from 1970 to 2015 found that the incidence of failed intubation at cesarean section remained the same over the time period studied, at 0.23 percent, with one death per 90 failed intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Maternal deaths were the result of aspiration, hypoxemia due to airway obstruction, or esophageal intubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H588503118\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ante- and intrapartum anatomic and physiologic changes of the airway, gastrointestinal system, and respiratory function can increase the risk for a difficult intubation, as well as the risk of complications when airway difficulty occurs. Pregnant patients may also have risk factors for difficult airway management unrelated to their pregnancy status. (See <a href=\"#H1124899015\" class=\"local\">'Identify patients with a difficult airway'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway changes</strong> &ndash; Pregnancy weight gain and increased breast size can make optimal head and neck positioning difficult and can decrease the space available to open the mandible and place the laryngoscope blade. The use of a short laryngoscope handle can be helpful. The need to maintain a tilted body position for left uterine displacement may also impede optimal positioning for airway management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As gestation advances, the oropharyngeal diameter appears to narrow, possibly due to oropharyngeal edema from fluid retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a study that used the modified Mallampati classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 1</a>) to evaluate maternal airways, the number of patients with Mallampati class 4 airways increased by 34 percent between 12 and 38 weeks of gestation, and the increase correlated significantly with weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hyperemia and growth of nasal polyps increase the risk of bleeding with placement of nasal airways.

In studies evaluating airway changes between the onset and the end of labor, significant decreases in oral volume, and pharyngeal area and volume were observed, and the modified Mallampati classification increased by one grade in 33 percent of parturients and by two grades in 5 percent of parturients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In another study, worsening Mallampati class during labor did not correlate with longer duration of labor or greater volume of fluids administered, and had not fully returned to baseline at 48 hours postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal changes</strong> &ndash; The obstetric patient is at increased risk of aspiration of gastric contents due to hormonal and anatomic changes in pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>), often in conjunction with use of parenteral or neuraxial opioid analgesics. In a patient with a full stomach without protective airway reflexes (ie, after induction of anesthesia), difficulties in airway management prolong the period of risk for aspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory changes</strong> &ndash; Increased metabolic oxygen consumption combined with a decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) render pregnant patients less tolerant of apnea; there is a shorter time between onset of apnea and development of hypoxemia when general anesthesia is induced.

(See <a href=\"#H270053732\" class=\"local\">'Airway assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>If a patient has a potentially difficult airway, specific plans should be formulated for airway management, should it become necessary, and the entire care team (anesthesiologist, obstetrician, nursing staff) made aware.</p><p>The airway can worsen during the course of labor, so patients should be re-examined prior to airway management if significant time has elapsed since the initial airway evaluation. In particular, the size of the tongue and uvula should be noted for women in prolonged labor or who are pre-eclamptic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87272\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87272 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H588503118\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic and physiologic changes'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270053732\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of bedside tests and measurements have been developed to evaluate the airway in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108981 \">table 1</a>). Patient characteristics that have been shown to predict difficulty with airway management are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94434 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94436 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94433\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94433 \">table 4</a>). Bedside airway testing is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H3052647100\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Recognition of the difficult airway'</a>.)</p><p>In pregnant patients, the ability to predict airway difficulty is limited. As an example, in a prospective study of airway evaluation using five predictors of difficult intubation prior to emergency cesarean delivery, the majority (79 percent) of difficult intubations were missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Similarly, in a review of failed obstetric intubations over 45 years, two-thirds were not predicted to be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the lack of sensitivity, at the very least, preoperative airway assessment forces the clinician to think about potential difficulty with airway management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514856\"><span class=\"h2\">Use regional anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most urgent cesarean deliveries may be performed under neuraxial anesthesia; when a labor epidural is in place, it can be quickly dosed for surgical delivery, or a spinal anesthetic can be urgently placed. However, fetal bradycardia and perceived lack of time can prompt the need for general anesthesia, so a plan for airway management is essential in parturients with a difficult airway.</p><p>Patients at high risk of a cesarean delivery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>) may benefit from having a functional epidural in place in the event an anesthetic is required emergently. Unless specifically indicated, general anesthesia involves higher risk than neuraxial anesthesia for both the parturient and fetus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery#H741059322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a>). Particularly for patients with possible difficult airways, or those in whom rapid neuraxial placement may be difficult (eg, obesity), it is prudent to place an epidural, and verify that it is functional, before there is urgent need for it.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia can be initiated quickly in most patients, even when urgent cesarean delivery is indicated. In patients with an anticipated difficult airway, this is often quicker than performing an awake intubation. (See <a href=\"#H14531091\" class=\"local\">'Anticipated difficult intubation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702937552\"><span class=\"h2\">Prepare emergency equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is prudent to have a system in place to check on a regular basis that anesthesia equipment and supplies on the labor and delivery unit are both available and functional. There is not time to assemble resources when an emergency intubation is needed. A formal system for summoning assistance can be useful. (See <a href=\"#H14531047\" class=\"local\">'Available airway equipment'</a> below.)</p><p>Immediately prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">induction/intubation,</span> both routine and emergency airway equipment should again be checked for availability and functionality. The use of a surgical safety checklist modified for obstetric surgery has been adopted at the authors' institution. This checklist is reviewed prior to any elective or emergency obstetric surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702937265\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce the risk of aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obstetric patient is at increased risk of aspiration of gastric contents, especially in cases of difficult or failed intubation, when mask ventilation may be required (see <a href=\"#H588503118\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic and physiologic changes'</a> above). The risk may be reduced by fasting and use of pharmacologic prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fasting guidelines for scheduled cesarean delivery</strong> &ndash; For scheduled cesarean delivery, the fasting guidelines are similar to those for other elective procedures, as described in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The authors allow clear liquids until two hours prior to an elective procedure, which does not increase gastric volume; gastric emptying of water in healthy, term pregnant, non-laboring patients was slightly shorter after ingestion of 300 mL of water compared with 50 mL, and at 60 minutes was similar to the gastric volume after an overnight fast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. This was true among both normal-weight and obese parturients. Although there is insufficient evidence to address the safety of fasting for any particular period after solid food, an interval of six hours is typically recommended for a light meal (eg, toast and clear liquid), and eight hours for fatty or fried meals, prior to any elective surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fasting guidelines for laboring patients</strong> &ndash; Gastric emptying of solid foods during labor is delayed, and intake should be avoided, especially when parenteral or neuraxial opioids are given. Patients with increased risk factors for aspiration (eg, severe obesity, diabetes, difficult airway) or patients at increased risk for operative delivery (eg, pre-eclampsia, multiple gestations) may require further restrictions of oral intake, which is determined on an individual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The ASA practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion allow for oral intake of modest amounts of clear liquids for patients with uncomplicated labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. In the authors' practice, we limit parturients to eight ounces of clear liquids per hour after the placement of an epidural; further restrictions, based on an individual patient's aspiration risk, are left to the discretion of the managing clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacologic and mechanical aspiration prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; Preoperative administration of nonparticulate antacids (eg, sodium citrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>) or H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists are effective in decreasing gastric acidity. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> decreases peripartum nausea and vomiting, and increases lower esophageal sphincter tone and gastric emptying. The use of these medications in the setting of cesarean delivery is discussed elsewhere.

Due to the infrequent occurrence of difficult and failed airway, all personnel working on obstetric units should regularly review the difficult airway algorithms (see <a href=\"#H14531075\" class=\"local\">'Management of the difficult airway'</a> below); simulator training and drills can serve to improve and maintain skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531003\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION FOR AIRWAY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal intubation is indicated in any pregnant patient who requires general anesthesia, due to concerns of aspiration. Either rapid sequence induction or an awake intubation technique is indicated, as with any patient with &quot;full stomach&quot; precautions; the approach depends on the evaluation of the patient's airway and the clinical situation. An intubation strategy should aim to quickly secure the airway, with alternative plans in place for both unanticipated and anticipated difficulty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531040\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is very important to consider proper positioning of the pregnant patient, which maximizes the chance of successful intubation and may be the most important factor for successful direct laryngoscopy in the parturient, especially in cases of morbid obesity. In the general population, shoulder and head elevation to bring the patient's sternum and external auditory meatus to the same horizontal plane maintains or improves laryngoscopic views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The neck should be slightly flexed and elevated at the cervicothoracic junction to align the laryngeal and pharyngeal axes, while the head should be extended at the atlantooccipital joint to align the pharyngeal and oral axes. This position can be achieved by elevation of the upper back and shoulders with blankets or with a preformed intubation ramp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95285 \">figure 2</a>). It is essential to maintain at least 15 degrees of left uterine displacement during this time to minimize aortocaval compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; this can be achieved by either tilting the operating table or placing a wedge beneath the patient's right hip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124896820\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pregnancy, functional residual capacity (FRC) is lower and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption higher, shortening the time to desaturation when the patient is apneic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;, section on 'Respiratory changes'</a>). This makes it critical that patients have effective oxygenation and denitrogenation before the induction of anesthesia causes apnea. O<sub>2</sub> should be administered to the patient as she is positioned on the operating table, using a tight-fitting mask to avoid entraining room air. We also suggest the administration of O<sub>2</sub> by nasal cannula at 10 L in addition to facemask O<sub>2</sub> in those patients who are at high risk for difficult laryngoscopy and intubation.

At the authors' institution, a &quot;code airway&quot; system is in place to emergently summon a general surgery team and emergency airway supplies to the bedside; anesthesia physicians refresh skills for cricothyrotomy annually, but emergency invasive airway procedures are usually performed by surgeons.</p><p>A formal tracheostomy takes time and should only be performed by those with appropriate skills. Jet ventilation is also an option but is difficult, especially in obese patients, and can have devastating complications including pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum, mucosal trauma, tracheal necrosis, atelectasis, and inadequate ventilation when not performed correctly.</p><p>Once attempts to ventilate are successful, the risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery should be discussed with the obstetric team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531126\"><span class=\"h2\">Extubation of the patient with a difficult airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Care must be taken when extubating the patient with a difficult airway; airway compromise during emergence and in the post-anesthesia period has become the main cause of airway tragedies in the obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Monitoring and discharge criteria should be equivalent to those for other surgical patients. At the authors' institution, parturients are monitored with continuous pulse oximetry by a registered nurse for one to two hours; following formal evaluation by an anesthesiologist, pulse oximetry may be stopped or continued as needed. Continued pulse oximetry is more likely in patients with a history of OSA, with ongoing administration of sedating medications (eg, opioids), or episodes of desaturation or apnea in the postpartum period. Prolonged monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is prudent in patients who have received both neuraxial and IV opioids, in whom delayed respiratory depression may occur. At one editor's institution, high-risk patients are monitored for 24 hours. Continuous pulse oximetry should be available on the postpartum recovery floors as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531133\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTED PATIENT POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531142\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidly obese parturient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with normal-weight women, the morbidly obese parturient is at increased risk of cesarean delivery, emergency cesarean delivery, failed epidural, and difficult intubation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;</a>).

Aspiration is the main potential complication of failed intubation, and an SGA with a drain port may assist in preventing regurgitation of stomach contents.
