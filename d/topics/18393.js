This topic will discuss fertility treatment for individuals chronically infected with HIV or hepatitis C virus, as these individuals can transmit the infection to an uninfected partner during the process of conception. Counseling these couples about the safest methods for avoiding viral transmission to their partner involves discussion of adoption, child-free living, and use of donor sperm, in addition to natural or assisted conception with their own gametes.</p><p>Recommendations for reducing the risk of viral transmission during fertility treatment have been published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In a group of serodiscordant (male HIV-infected) opposite-sex couples, 70 percent of the couples expressed a desire to have children in the future if their fertility treatment was successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Predictors of couples&rsquo; desires for additional children if fertility treatment was successful were: younger age, shorter relationship duration, being childless currently, and having the male partner diagnosis of HIV known prior to when the couple met. Thus, an understanding of overall fertility desires in this patient population is important, in combination with a discussion of various methods by which pregnancy can be achieved.</p><p>Men and women living with HIV may seek assistance in pregnancy planning so they can avoid unprotected intercourse with an uninfected partner when the couple is attempting to conceive. One survey reported that 12 percent of HIV serodiscordant couples concerned about transmission of HIV to their partner would still be willing to have unprotected timed intercourse if no other alternatives existed for achieving pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ideally, these couples should have an alternative to unprotected intercourse because even partners with undetectable plasma HIV levels can transmit HIV in semen, female genital secretions, and rectal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the risk of transmission appears to be very low when the HIV-infected partner is receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

A team of providers knowledgeable in this area should review each case, including the couple's ability to tolerate the fertility evaluation, treatment, and pregnancy.</p><p>Access to an institution that can care for pregnant patients with HIV and the child delivered under these circumstances is also a prerequisite to beginning fertility treatment.

A review of age-specific fertility rates (ASFR) from demographic and health surveys revealed a decreasing fertility rate among HIV-infected women compared to HIV-uninfected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. ASFR is calculated as the total number of births in the 36 months preceding the survey divided by the sum of woman-years at childbearing age during that 36 months multiplied by 1000 for every five-year bracket. The ASFR ratio (defined as a ratio of ASFRs of HIV-infected women divided by ASFRs of HIV-uninfected women) for each five-year bracket group from 15 to 49 years old was 1.2, 0.77, 0.71, 0.65, 0.59, 0.53, 0.47. In addition, a case-control study reported lower anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone levels for women with HIV compared with uninfected control women (3.0 &plusmn;2.8 versus 3.7 &plusmn; 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the clinical significance of this difference is not yet know. A different case-control study reported a lower clinical pregnancy rate per transfer, although the implantation and live birth rates per transfer were not significantly different between HIV-infected women compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>For HIV-infected men, semen testing (especially those using antiretroviral therapy) has revealed a lower ejaculate volume, decreased sperm motility, and increased abnormal sperm morphology compared to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15557583\"><span class=\"h3\">Counseling and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receive counseling about the psychosocial factors involved in pursuing fertility treatment and are evaluated to make sure they understand and accept these risks.

Options include use of donor sperm, IUI using prepared (washed) sperm from the infected male, or in vitro fertilization (with intracytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI]) using prepared (washed) sperm from the infected male. The male partner should be receiving antiretroviral therapy and ideally demonstrate sustained suppression of plasma viral load below the limits of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Oral periconception pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for the female partner.

If the couple elects to use donor sperm, they should be informed that donor sperm samples are quarantined for at least 180 days (ie, six months) after the date of donation to allow testing and retesting of the donors for communicable diseases, such as HIV. Donor insemination is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-insemination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor insemination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">IUI with processed sperm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For couples who do not wish to use donor sperm, sperm preparation techniques (ie, sperm washing) combined with IUI or IVF are options for limiting the risk of HIV transmission to the uninfected female partner. The rationale for this approach, even when there is no detectable virus in the male's serum, comes from data reporting that semen may contain a high viral load and transmission to a partner can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The risk of female seroconversion is likely to be substantially reduced by utilizing medically assisted reproduction. In couples with a normal fertility evaluation, IUI with specially processed sperm is a safe and effective strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Some specialists also treat the female partner with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at the time of IUI with washed sperm. In a study of 11 serodiscordant couples who underwent 28 cycles of IUI using washed sperm combined with PrEP, six cycles resulted in pregnancy (fecundability rate of 21 percent), and all of the women remained HIV seronegative at six months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, for couples in which the semen analysis is abnormal, IVF may be the best treatment option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested that HIV is carried in the seminal fluid and white blood cells and that spermatozoa do not carry the virus because they do not have the necessary viral receptors, but this is controversial. Most authorities believe that the sperm do not have HIV on their surface or in the cell. However, it is easy to contaminate a sperm preparation with microscopic quantities of semen. Sperm washing prior to IUI eliminates the round cells, seminal plasma, and the majority of immotile sperm. Sperm are isolated by sequential density gradient and swim-up techniques and are then tested by PCR assays for the presence of HIV RNA. Using this method of sperm preparation, less than 1 percent of sperm samples from HIV-infected men test positive (typically, these &quot;positives&quot; are &quot;low level&quot; positive tests). </p><p>A Cochrane Review noted, however, that there were no relevant clinical trials identified in the literature to determine the benefits and risks of sperm washing to prevent HIV transmission in the setting of attempted conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Our current information base is derived from observational studies which demonstrate a need for further research with a multicenter randomized trial in this area. As there have been no documented transmissions of HIV through any processing methods currently used, it is unclear how randomization to treatment other than sperm washing could ethically be performed.</p><p>The goal of IUI is to place &quot;virus free&quot; sperm into the uterine cavity near the time of ovulation. If PCR assays are negative for HIV, the sperm are transferred into the uterine cavity via a flexible catheter. Using this protocol over several thousand cycles, there has been a zero rate of seroconversion in female partners and no documented births of HIV-infected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, couples should be counseled that the risk of acquiring HIV from insemination with prepared (washed) sperm from an HIV-infected partner has not yet definitively been proven to be zero. We may be approaching assurance of a transmission rate of zero with the advent of nested PCR, which can detect a single HIV viral copy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">IVF with ICSI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine insemination has been the traditional medical approach to achieving conception in discordant couples because of convenience and low cost. Since this approach still leaves the potential for thousands to millions of sperm and possible remnants of HIV from the seminal fluid to come into contact with the female partner, the use of IVF with ICSI has had growing appeal, even when there is no evidence of female or male infertility factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/31-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-39</a>].

Nevertheless, as with IUI, prevention of HIV viral transmission cannot be guaranteed. Even though IVF with ICSI theoretically reduces the female's exposure to the virus, there are several reasons that it is not the standard technique for all HIV discordant couples. For example, pregnancies conceived by IVF are associated with increased risks of multiple gestations, congenital anomalies, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and the complications associated with these outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy outcome after assisted reproductive technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the process of IVF, which involves ovulation induction, egg retrieval, and embryo transfer, is not a risk-free surgical procedure and is costly.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a>.)

Many couples with autosomal recessive diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs, have a 25 percent chance of transmitting the disease to their child.

Physicians cannot claim to be simply the &quot;technical agents&quot; who perform the procedures to achieve conception without acknowledging the risk of transmission of HIV to the child.

In a study that evaluated three cohort groups, anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone levels of HCV-infected women were lower than those of controls (1.8 &plusmn;2.0 vs. 2.5 &plusmn;1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> and had an increased likelihood of being in the undetectable range (&lt;0.16 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL;</span> odds ratio 11.625, 95% CI 2.651-50.970) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In addition, HCV-infected women had increased rates of infertility, miscarriage, premature birth, gestation diabetes, and preeclampsia as well as reduced rates of live birth. Treatment with antiviral therapy that resulted in a sustained virologic response was associated with a reduced rate of miscarriage. </p><p>The risk of vertical transmission correlates with maternal viral burden. The risk of transmission was 36 percent when HCV RNA titers were greater &ge;1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and 0 when titers were &le;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. There is a 5 to 10 percent risk of transmission with unknown viral titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28923069\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual transmission of hepatitis B between serodiscordant couples can be prevented by vaccination of the seronegative spouse.

There are inadequate data to prove that any management approach is significantly safer than any other. In addition, choice of treatment is based upon the available resources and results of standard infertility tests, which are also part of the decision making process. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased longevity and quality of life have led HIV-infected individuals to think about childbearing and to seek assistance in conceiving so that they may avoid placing their partner at risk of infection or potentially acquiring a new viral strain of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general consensus in the legal and medical community is that couples or individuals who are HIV-infected should not be denied access to infertility treatment or treatment to decrease the risk of infection in an uninfected partner when the couple is attempting to conceive. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Legal and ethical issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients seeking assisted reproduction services should have high motivation for childbearing, well-controlled HIV with a stable CD4 count, undetectable virus in the serum and the semen (&lt;50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL),</span> and antiretroviral medication adherence of &gt;90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Optimal candidates for fertility services'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the female is HIV-uninfected and the male is HIV-infected, the risk of male to female transmission is likely to be substantially reduced by utilizing medically assisted reproduction. In women with a normal fertility evaluation, we suggest intrauterine insemination (IUI) with doubly processed sperm as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If unsuccessful or for couples with a known female factor infertility diagnosis, in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be performed. Donor sperm is an additional option. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'HIV-infected male and HIV-uninfected female'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the female is HIV-infected and the male is HIV-uninfected, intrauterine insemination using the male partner's sperm will avoid female to male transmission from unprotected intercourse. In women with a normal fertility evaluation, we suggest intrauterine insemination (IUI) as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If IUI is unsuccessful or if there is severe male factor infertility, in-vitro fertilization or donor sperm insemination can be performed as per usual protocols. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'HIV-infected male and HIV-uninfected female'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful antiretroviral therapy for the HIV-infected partner, and potentially periconceptional pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis (PrEP) for the uninfected partner, are important interventions to prevent HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples desiring natural conception. In addition to optimal medical management, serodiscordant couples should time unprotected intercourse to coincide with ovulation to maximize the chance of pregnancy and minimize the number of exposed sexual events. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Natural conception in serodiscordant couples'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the female is HCV-uninfected and the male is HCV-infected, similar principles to HIV serodiscordant couples apply. We suggest IUI with specially processed sperm (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). IVF (with or without ICSI) and donor sperm are other options, depending on patient-specific factors. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis C'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'HCV-infected male and HCV-uninfected female'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the female is HCV-infected and the male is HCV-uninfected, IUI therapy will decrease the risk of transmission to the male partner. IVF or donor sperm can be utilized when indicated. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'HCV-infected female and HCV-uninfected male'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
