Its presence primarily in patients with longstanding active disease who test positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), and for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4, suggests important roles for chronic inflammation in a genetically predisposed individual.</p><p>Neutropenia in patients with FS results from an imbalance between granulocyte production and granulocyte removal from the circulating pool. One or more of the following can contribute to the development of neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/2-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies to deiminated histones (predominantly histone H3) and other components of neutrophil extracellular chromatin traps (NETs) that bind to activated neutrophils, which are then sequestered in the spleen (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Splenomegaly'</a> below) and depleted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies that bind and neutralize granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxic lymphocytes, which infiltrate the bone marrow and inhibit myelopoiesis.

However, a subsequent study, utilizing a large Veterans Administration database, has shown a steady decline in prevalence during the two decades ending in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The basis for this decrease in prevalence is not entirely understood. One proposed explanation is that the reclassification of some cases of FS as large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia may have contributed to the decreased number of patients diagnosed with FS since 1985, when the diagnosis of LGL leukemia was established, although this would not account for the entire decline (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Large granular lymphocyte leukemia in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>). Other factors have not been identified, but the widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and the introduction of targeted biological therapies for RA during that time period might also play a role.</p><p>The demographic features of patients with FS and of RA controls are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Women comprise 60 to 80 percent of patients, and the onset of arthritis usually occurs in the patients' late 30s or early 40s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].

As a result, it may not be detected for a prolonged period unless blood counts are being monitored for some other reason, such as the detection of possible toxicity to antirheumatic drugs. However, the diagnosis of FS may be masked in patients who present with infection, because active bacterial infection can raise the white blood cell count to a normal or even slightly elevated level; the neutropenia typically reappears within a short time after successful treatment of the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Splenomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenomegaly is present in most patients with FS and can be detected in more than 90 percent of patients with FS by carefully palpating the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Findings in patients with active disease often include anemia and elevated acute phase reactants. Thrombocytopenia may be present. The bone marrow usually shows myeloid hyperplasia with a relative excess of immature forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The neutropenia is typically persistent and unexplained by concurrent illnesses or drug therapy. The depression of the neutrophil count in FS varies spontaneously in the individual patient. It may increase to the normal range or even become mildly elevated during an infection. Those with mild neutropenia may, therefore, transiently achieve counts within the normal range, even without obvious infection.

This has been described as &quot;maturation arrest,&quot; but premature release of granulocytes into the circulation can give the same picture. Less common findings are a hypocellular marrow, suggesting a depression in myeloid activity, and an increase in marrow lymphocytes, which should arouse suspicion of the large granular lymphocyte syndrome.

Further, because antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double stranded (ds)DNA antibodies may be present in both conditions, and platelets and complement component levels may be decreased in both SLE and FS, laboratory testing may not be sufficient alone to differentiate SLE from FS (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above). The neutropenia in SLE typically has a prominent element of lymphopenia, and it is not unusual for these patients to have a normal differential white blood cell count. However, absolute neutropenia can also occur in SLE. Thus, both clinical and serologic criteria are usually used to distinguish between RA and SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/21,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34</a>]; both are somewhat less useful when FS complicates RA, because these patients often have both extraarticular involvement and immunologic abnormalities similar to those observed in some patients with SLE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite their potential similarities, laboratory findings are sometimes helpful. Laboratory features more consistent with SLE than FS include the presence of lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL)</span> and hemolytic anemia with a positive direct Coombs test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">FS and SLE can generally be distinguished based upon the clinical findings. Examples of helpful clinical features include the presence of nephritis, central nervous system disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> typical photosensitive rash, which point toward a diagnosis of SLE; while erosive arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> typical rheumatoid nodules are generally indicative of RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large granular lymphocyte syndrome</strong> &ndash; The LGL syndrome may be associated with neutropenia with or without splenomegaly. The diagnosis is suggested by an increased proportion of LGL cells on the peripheral smear or in a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy. FS may be difficult to differentiate from the LGL syndrome, particularly when arthritis and splenomegaly are present in the latter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Large granular lymphocyte leukemia in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Molecular differentiation of the LGL syndrome from FS is based upon the demonstration in the LGL syndrome of a characteristic, expanded (and usually clonal) lymphocyte population. Immunophenotyping in LGL will indicate the presence of a population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes expressing a set of surface markers (eg, CD 2, 3, 8, 16, and 57) that is infrequent in FS. The demonstration of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities or clonal T cell receptor (TCR) gene recombination in patients with characteristic lymphocyte phenotypes provides additional diagnostic confirmation of the LGL syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of neutropenia and splenomegaly</strong> &ndash; Other conditions that may cause splenomegaly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neutropenia can mimic FS when they occur in patients with RA. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug reactions or toxicities &ndash; Antibiotics and many other drugs can cause neutropenia, but those likeliest to be used in patients with RA or other forms of inflammatory arthritis include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], gold, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-neutropenia-and-agranulocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Amyloidosis &ndash; Splenomegaly, caused by amyloid deposition in the spleen, is seen in 4 to 15 percent of patients with primary (AL) or secondary (AA) amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients with RA may develop AA amyloidosis as a result of chronic inflammation, with associated splenomegaly mimicking FS. However, these patients typically do not exhibit neutropenia, and Congo red staining of an abdominal fat pad aspirate may confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematologic malignancies &ndash; Splenomegaly frequently occurs in patients with hematological malignancies, predominantly in those with acute leukemia, but also in patients with lymphomas or with chronic leukemia. Neutropenia may also be present in these patients, especially after chemotherapy. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy or lymph node biopsy will differentiate a hematologic malignancy from FS in a patient with RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HIV infection &ndash; Splenomegaly may be present in patients with HIV infection. However, serologic evidence of HIV infection distinguishes these patients from those with FS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sarcoidosis &ndash; Splenomegaly is present in up to a third of patients with sarcoidosis. However, the presence of lymphadenopathy with noncaseating granulomata identified in a lymph node biopsy distinguishes these patients from those with FS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrapulmonary-manifestations-of-sarcoidosis#H18586389\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Lymph nodes, liver, and spleen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tuberculosis &ndash; Splenomegaly may be seen in patients with tuberculosis (TB). However, evidence of infection with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, by skin testing, interferon-gamma release assays, or culture, distinguishes these patients from those with FS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Epstein-Barr viral infection &ndash; Splenomegaly is present in 50 to 60 percent of patients with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection. However, serologic evidence of EBV infection distinguishes these patients from those with FS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Splenomegaly and splenic rupture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malaria &ndash; Patients with malaria develop splenic enlargement as a result of parasitemia, as well as because of clearance of immune complexes caused by chronic antigenic stimulation by cells of the reticuloendothelial system. These patients typically are anemic and may exhibit pancytopenia, but the presence of fever or of plasmodia on examination of the peripheral blood smear distinguish patients with malaria from those with FS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;, section on 'Uncomplicated malaria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;, section on 'Severe malaria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cirrhosis &ndash; Patients with hepatic cirrhosis have abnormal liver function studies and may develop portal hypertension, which can result in variceal bleeding. Portal hypertension may also occur in FS (see <a href=\"#H4187223755\" class=\"local\">'Portal hypertension'</a> above). In patients with FS, portal hypertension is not due to cirrhosis, but rather is the result of idiopathic&nbsp;noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Liver biopsy can distinguish between idiopathic&nbsp;noncirrhotic portal hypertension and hepatic cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As originally described, Felty's syndrome (FS) refers to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), otherwise unexplained neutropenia, and splenomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RA is typically severe, longstanding, erosive, and seropositive (rheumatoid factor [RF]- and anticyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibody-positive). Other extraarticular manifestations of RA are often present. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;2000/microL)</span> may be asymptomatic or may be noted in association with recurrent bacterial infections. Various mechanisms may contribute to the neutropenia of FS. (See <a href=\"#H542650740\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract and skin, due to typical pathogens of these sites, are increased in frequency. Lower neutrophil counts and the presence of other clinical and laboratory features are associated with an increased risk of infection. (See <a href=\"#H542651450\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenomegaly, as determined by physical examination, is present in more than 90 percent of patients with FS. However, a diagnosis of FS may be appropriate in a patient with RA and neutropenia in whom no other cause is apparent. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Splenomegaly'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no diagnostic laboratory test for FS. A complete blood count and differential white blood cell count and review of the peripheral smear to exclude large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia should be performed. Elevated markers of the acute phase response (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) and the presence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies in serum are usually noted. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow examination is usually necessary to exclude other causes of neutropenia. Adequate or increased myeloid elements with a relative increase in immature granulocyte precursors are the most common finding. Hypocellularity or an excess of lymphocytes is less frequently noted. Immunophenotyping can distinguish FS from LGL leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies other than RF (eg, antinuclear antibodies [ANA], antihistone antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [ANCA], anti-double-stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA] antibodies, anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase antibodies) are commonly present in sera from those with FS. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the LGL syndrome, and drug reactions are among the other causes of neutropenia and splenomegaly that should be excluded in the differential diagnosis of FS.
