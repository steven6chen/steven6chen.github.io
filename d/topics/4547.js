We recommend that all patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) undergo risk assessment soon after the diagnosis is made, as it helps not only to provide patients with information about their prognosis, but it may guide the timing of coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Risk assessment is performed using a risk stratification tool, such as the TIMI risk score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or GRACE risk score (<a href=\"http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/acs_risk/acs_risk_content.html&amp;token=Aj7Ikk3YG7ozDbwa+jgoCbRldgMbbe60+cIWadCKWTdedCLIubLfXGwJhS3juMg+4Bw/9/QxrKweaazydU7oChoc4UJ1h816aNPnG72oC10=&amp;TOPIC_ID=46\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/acs_risk/acs_risk_content.html</a>) in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F88782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88782 \">table 1</a>). These might include individuals for whom the need for urgent cardiac catheterization is not necessary or those who refuse cardiac interventional procedures. Risk stratification is discussed in detail separately.

After risk assessment, patients should be assigned to one of three categories: immediate angiography, an invasive approach, or a conservative approach. In general, unstable patients are referred for immediate angiography, high-risk patients are assigned to an invasive strategy, and low-risk patients are assigned to a conservative strategy. </p><p>The risk assessment tools (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Early risk assessment'</a> above) are not perfect predictive instruments and judgement needs to be exercised from time to time in terms of deciding on the best strategy for each patient. Patients assessed to be at low risk (eg, TIMI score of 0 to 2; in-hospital <span class=\"nowrap\">death/myocardial</span> infarction (MI) rate of up to 3 percent or GRACE risk score &le;108) are considered for a conservative approach. In addition, these individuals typically have no significant ST-segment deviation on the electrocardiogram and no troponin elevation. Even with a low risk score, however, we often refer patients who have a low risk score but a positive troponin or significant ST-segment deviation for angiography during the index hospitalization. </p><p>The three strategies are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The strategy of <strong>immediate angiography</strong> followed by revascularization takes place soon after the diagnosis and is indicated for patients assessed to have a poor short-term (or long-term) prognosis due the non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>invasive strategy</strong> of angiography followed by revascularization is aimed at improving long-term prognosis. In these patients, angiography followed by revascularization is intended and usually performed within 4 to 48 hours of admission. Some experts refer to intended angiography within 24 hours as an <strong>early invasive approach</strong> and intended angiography within 48 hours a <strong>delayed invasive approach</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>conservative strategy</strong> begins with rapidly intensifying medical therapy. Patients who become asymptomatic on this regimen are given several days to &quot;cool off,&quot; during which time intravenous medications are discontinued. If the patient remains symptom-free, stress testing is performed, most often with some form of myocardial imaging (nuclear or echocardiography). Persistence of symptoms, symptom recurrence, or a positive stress test should lead to prompt cardiac catheterization.

An invasive strategy, even if not carried out immediately, can limit the extent of MI and potentially improve long-term prognosis. </p><p>A 2006 meta-analysis of seven trials with 8375 NSTEACS patients, including the FRISC II, TACTICS-TIMI 18, RITA-3, and ICTUS trials, concluded that an invasive approach led to better outcomes compared to a conservative strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There were four studies with 3961 patients that performed an early invasive strategy within 24 hours; in the other three studies, this approach was performed between 24 and 48 hours.</p><p>The following benefits were noted with an early invasive strategy at a mean follow-up of two years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of all-cause mortality (4.9 versus 6.5 percent with conventional therapy, RR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.90).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of nonfatal MI (7.6 versus 9.1 percent, RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of rehospitalization for unstable angina at 13 months of follow-up (RR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.65-0.74).</p><p/><p>These findings were despite the fact that the ICTUS trial found no benefit from an early invasive compared to a selective invasive strategy in 1200 patients with a NSTEACS who had chest pain, an elevated serum cardiac troponin T, and either electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of ischemia or a documented history of coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. It cannot be determined with confidence why the results in this trial were different from others in the meta-analysis.

Coronary angiography was before 24 hours in the early invasive arms of the studies and between 12 and 108 hours in the delayed arms. There was no survival benefit associated with the early invasive strategy (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.03). In prespecified analyses of patients at high risk, mortality was lower with the early invasive strategy (elevated biomarker [HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-1.00]), diabetes (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99), a GRACE risk score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F88782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88782 \">table 1</a>) more than 140 (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95), and age 75 years or older (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.93).</p><p>A prior meta-analysis came to a similar conclusion with regard to mortality and also found no significant differences in the rates of MI or major bleeding in a broad population of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Until further studies inform decision making between culprit lesion only or multivessel PCI, we use clinical status and disease severity to guide our approach. For example, after considering the risk benefit ratio, we perform PCI on tight (greater than 75 percent diameter stenosis) non-culprit lesions that supply a large portion of the left ventricular myocardium, assuming the anatomy is of relatively low risk and the procedure time and contrast volume have not exceeded a threshold for increased risk with a longer procedure, Confirmation of the hemodynamic significance of a lesion using fractional flow reserve may guide the decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The following studies provide some evidence to support a multivessel approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety and efficacy of multivessel stenting versus culprit-only stenting with bare metal stents was evaluated in a retrospective study of 1240 patients with NSTEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
