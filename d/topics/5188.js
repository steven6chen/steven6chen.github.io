Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by a high serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration and a low serum free thyroxine (T4) concentration, whereas subclinical hypothyroidism is defined biochemically as a normal free T4 concentration in the presence of an elevated TSH concentration. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by a low serum T4 concentration and a serum TSH concentration that is not appropriately elevated.</p><p>This topic will review diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults.

The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is higher, ranging from 4 to 10 percent of adults, with possibly a higher frequency in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/1,2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,7</a>]. However, there is an age-related shift towards higher TSH concentrations in older patients, and therefore, if age-adjusted normal ranges are used, the prevalence may not increase with old age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;, section on 'Serum TSH concentration'</a>.)</p><p>Hypothyroidism is five to eight times more common in women than men, and more common in women with small body size at birth and during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p>In the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, 13,344 people without known thyroid disease or a family history of thyroid disease had measurements of serum TSH, T4, thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism was found in 4.6 percent (0.3 percent overt and 4.3 percent subclinical).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism was found in 1.3 percent (0.5 percent overt and 0.7 percent subclinical).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum TPO antibody concentrations were high in 11 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean serum TSH concentrations were significantly lower in blacks than in whites or Mexican-Americans.</p><p/><p>Thus, a significant proportion of the United States population has laboratory evidence of thyroid disease, suggesting that routine screening could be useful.

Common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, and menstrual irregularities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62676 \">table 1</a>). Physical examination findings may include goiter (particularly in patients with iodine deficiency or goitrous chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [Hashimoto's thyroiditis]), bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and a delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes. In the majority of patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are elevated. A variety of metabolic abnormalities may be present including hypercholesterolemia, macrocytic anemia, elevated creatine kinase, and hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Some experts have suggested that the true upper limit is only 2.5 or 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> in healthy individuals without thyroid disease, while others argue that the serum TSH distribution shifts towards higher values with age, independent of the presence of antithyroid antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], or in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Central hypothyroidism is due to insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH, and it is caused by either hypothalamic (tertiary hypothyroidism) or pituitary (secondary hypothyroidism) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

As a result, the symptoms and the serum free T4 value must be used to make the diagnosis. Thus, we measure both serum TSH and free T4 if pituitary or hypothalamic disease is suspected (eg, a young woman with amenorrhea and fatigue). We also measure free T4 if the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal TSH result. In patients with central hypothyroidism, the serum free T4 value is low-normal to low and serum TSH may be frankly low, inappropriately normal (for the low T4), or slightly high (7 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> due to secretion of biologically inactive TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of central hypothyroidism are reviewed in detail separately.

High serum TSH concentrations may also occur in primary adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and factitiously in rare patients who have antibodies to the murine immunoglobulins used in the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], or complexes of TSH bound to immunoglobulin G (IgG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2107145\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance to TSH or thyroid hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated TSH concentration may rarely be due to resistance to TSH secondary to alterations in the TSH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], failure of the cell to express the receptor at the cell surface, or to receptor-independent mechanisms. Many of these patients are euthyroid, while others are hypothyroid. Serum free T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations are typically normal or low. The thyroid gland is not enlarged. It may be difficult to distinguish subclinical hypothyroidism (common) from resistance to TSH (rare). The presence of other family members expressing the same phenotype and ultimately a defect in the TSH receptor confirms the diagnosis of resistance to TSH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance to thyrotropin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with mutations in the T3 receptor (generalized thyroid hormone resistance) have a normal or elevated TSH, but serum free T4 and T3 are also elevated.

The history, for example, may uncover past treatment of hyperthyroidism with radioiodine or thyroidectomy, the use of drugs that affect thyroid hormone synthesis, or history of iodine deficiency or excess. Physical examination may, in some cases, reveal thyroid enlargement (goiter) or an old thyroidectomy scar.

The two major forms of the disorder are goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis and atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis, with the common pathologic feature being lymphocytic infiltration and the common serological feature being the presence of high serum concentrations of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin.

The primary benefit of screening for hypothyroidism is the detection of hypothyroidism before the occurrence of symptoms. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common in the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, there is no evidence that early detection and treatment with T4 improves clinically important outcomes in individuals with hypothyroidism detected by screening. Although T4 replacement therapy has few side effects when properly dosed, overtreatment with thyroid hormone is common and may be associated with adverse skeletal and cardiovascular effects, particularly in older patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>There are two strategies for screening asymptomatic individuals: screening all individuals over a certain age (when risk of hypothyroidism increases), or screening only those individuals with clinical risk factors for hypothyroidism. In the absence of data supporting any screening strategy, we suggest screening patients at increased risk for hypothyroidism, including but not limited to patients with goiter, history of autoimmune disease, previous radioactive iodine therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> head and neck irradiation, family history of thyroid disease, and use of medications that may impair thyroid function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53510 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>We recommend measurement of serum TSH as a screening test for hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of screening for hypothyroidism. A computer decision model that evaluated a hypothetical cohort of women and men screened every five years beginning at age 35 years showed that screening for hypothyroidism was similarly cost effective as other accepted preventive practices (eg, breast cancer or hypertension screening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Benefit accrued mainly from the avoidance of symptoms of hypothyroidism when diagnosed and treated early and from the decrease in adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with the lower serum cholesterol concentrations in treated hypothyroid patients. The cost effectiveness of screening was most favorable in older women.</p><p>Although hypothyroidism is common in older adults (eg, 5 to 15 percent in women over the age of 65 years), there is no evidence that it is associated with adverse outcomes in the oldest individuals when detected by screening alone. This was illustrated in a population-based, prospective study of 558 individuals in the Netherlands who were screened for hypothyroidism during the month of their 85<sup>th</sup> birthday and again three years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere. In brief, we suggest a targeted approach to screening pregnant women. We favor screening pregnant women if they are from an area of moderate to severe iodine insufficiency, have symptoms of hypothyroidism, a family or personal history of thyroid disease, or a personal history of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, type 1 diabetes, head and neck radiation, recurrent miscarriage, morbid obesity, or infertility.

Although the normal range for serum free T4 concentrations is wide (approximately 0.8 to 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [10 to 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L]),</span> each person has an endogenous setpoint dictating the optimum concentration for that individual. TSH secretion increases when the serum free T4 concentration falls below that level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;, section on 'Regulation of thyroid hormone production'</a>.)</p><p>Primary thyroid disease accounts for over 95 percent of cases of hypothyroidism. As a result, measurement of serum TSH (rather than free T4 or total T4) is an excellent screening test for hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Drugs that can decrease TSH secretion include dopamine, high doses of glucocorticoids, and somatostatin analogues (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>).

Common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, and menstrual irregularities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62676 \">table 1</a>). Physical examination findings may include goiter (particularly in patients with iodine deficiency or goitrous chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [Hashimoto's thyroiditis]), bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and a delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes. Serum concentrations of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies are elevated in more than 90 percent of patients with hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based primarily upon laboratory testing. In most patients with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be the initial test. If the serum TSH concentration is elevated, the TSH measurement should be repeated along with a serum free thyroxine (T4) to make the diagnosis of hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>). If the repeat serum TSH value is still high and the serum free T4 is low, suggesting primary hypothyroidism, replacement therapy with T4 should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with a high serum TSH concentration and a normal serum free T4 concentration may have subclinical hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Primary hypothyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If central hypothyroidism is suspected (eg, presence of pituitary or hypothalamic disease), or if the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal TSH result, we measure serum TSH and free T4. In patients with central hypothyroidism, the serum free T4 value is low-normal or low and serum TSH may be frankly low, inappropriately normal (for the low T4), or slightly high (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> due to secretion of biologically inactive TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>).

The history, for example, may uncover past treatment of hyperthyroidism with radioiodine or thyroidectomy, the use of drugs that affect thyroid hormone synthesis, or history of iodine deficiency or excess. We do not routinely measure TPO antibodies in patients with primary overt hypothyroidism, because almost all have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.
