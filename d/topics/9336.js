The major clinical features, diagnosis, and management of ICP will be reviewed here. A general approach to the pregnant woman who develops liver disease is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver disease occurring during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ICP is the most common liver disease unique to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The reported incidence of ICP varies widely worldwide, ranging from &lt;1 to 27.6 percent, for reasons that are incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Geographic variations may reflect differences in susceptibility between ethnic groups, as well as differences in environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In the United States, incidence rates range from 0.32 percent in Bridgeport Hospital, Connecticut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] to 5.6 percent in a primarily Hispanic population in Los Angeles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Across Europe the incidence ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 percent, with the highest rates in Scandinavia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence is 1.2 to 1.5 percent in Indian-Asians and Pakistani Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The Araucanos Indians in Chile have the highest incidence worldwide at 27.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>For unknown reasons, the disease occurs more commonly in the winter months in some countries (eg, Sweden, Finland, Chile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is more common in multiple gestations (twins 20.9 versus singletons 4.7 percent in one study from Chile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; triplets 43 percent versus twins 14 percent in one study from Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]). Other epidemiologic factors include chronic hepatitis C, prior history or family history of intrahepatic cholestasis, and advanced maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Women with a past history of ICP frequently have ICP in subsequent pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H765193294\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of ICP is not completely understood, but likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility, hormonal factors, and environmental factors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic basis of ICP is complex, but genetic susceptibility to the disorder is supported by evidence of familial clustering, increased risk in first-degree relatives, increased risk in some ethnic groups, and a high (60 to 70 percent) recurrence rate (see <a href=\"#H765193294\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The <em>ABCB4 </em>(adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 4) gene encoding the multidrug resistance 3 (MDR3) protein (a canalicular phospholipid translocator) is primarily involved in a subtype of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis called PFIC3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Heterozygous mutations in <em>ABCB4</em> (also called <em>MDR3</em>) have been found in a large consanguineous family in whom some women had episodes of cholestasis during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Several heterozygous mutations in the <em>ABCB4</em> gene were subsequently reported in patients with ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. The prevalence of such <em>ABCB4</em> gene mutations in Caucasian patients with ICP is 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Some genes encoding for other canalicular transporters or their regulators may also be involved in ICP pathogenesis (eg, <em>ABCB11, ATP8B1, ABCC2, NR1H4</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen and progesterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A role for estrogen in ICP is supported by evidence that estrogen causes cholestasis in both experimental and clinical conditions: ICP occurs mainly in the second half of pregnancy when serum concentrations of estrogen reach peak levels; ICP is more common in twin pregnancies, which are associated with higher levels of circulating estrogen than singleton pregnancies; cholestasis occurs in women taking estrogen-progestin contraceptives; ICP has been reported in early pregnancy after ovarian hyperstimulation, which results in markedly high serum estrogen levels; and ICP resolves after delivery of the placenta, which was a major source of estrogen production across the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/9,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27,28</a>].</p><p>Alterations in progesterone metabolism may also play a role in the pathogenesis of ICP. In some genetically predisposed women, the formation of large amounts of sulfated progesterone metabolites in pregnancy, possibly related to greater 5-alpha and 3-alpha reduction, may result in saturation of the hepatic transport system(s) utilized for biliary excretion of these compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Pregnancy also decreases sulfotransferase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Whether administration of exogenous progesterone during pregnancy further increases the risk of ICP is unknown. In placebo-controlled randomized trials of progesterone supplementation for reducing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth, an increased frequency of ICP has not been specifically reported, but the package insert for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyprogesterone-caproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a> (Makena) describes an 8 percent incidence of pruritus in treated women and lists cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy, liver tumors (benign or malignant), or active liver disease as contraindications to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Specific causal factors in the environment have not been identified, but low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> levels due to diet and low vitamin D levels due to lack of exposure to sunlight have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/11,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243916402\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small subset of women with ICP has identifiable underlying liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. A large population-based study found an association between ICP and several chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis C and nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Progressive fibrosis was also reported in four sisters who had an atypical familial form of prolonged recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This suggests that some women who develop ICP have underlying liver disease revealed by pregnancy or contributing to the development of ICP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1152256237\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of ICP is typically heralded by the development of pruritus, which ranges from mild to intolerable. It is often generalized, but generally starts and predominates on the palms and soles and is worse at night. Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, poor appetite, sleep deprivation, or steatorrhea may occur. </p><p>Pruritus and other symptoms usually develop during the late second or third trimester. Transient first trimester symptoms have been linked to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after in vitro fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], while persistent and worsening symptoms are characteristic of naturally conceived pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Encephalopathy or other stigmata of liver failure, if present, should initiate a search for other causes of liver disease.

Jaundice occurs in 14 to 25 percent of patients, typically developing one to four weeks after the onset of itching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Jaundice without pruritus is rare and should prompt investigation of other causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increase in serum total bile acid concentration is the key laboratory finding<strong> </strong>(present in &gt;90 percent of affected pregnancies), and may be the first and only laboratory abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/32,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,40,41</a>]. Pruritus may precede laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Other potential laboratory abnormalities include increases in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum aminotransferases (elevated in 60 percent of cases), which are usually less than two times the upper limit of normal, but may reach values greater than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> making distinction from viral hepatitis important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkaline phosphatase, which may be elevated fourfold but is not specific for cholestasis during pregnancy due to expression of the placental isoenzyme.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total and direct bilirubin concentrations (elevated in 25 percent of cases), although total bilirubin levels rarely exceed 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. </p><p/><p>The serum concentration of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is normal or modestly elevated (30 percent of cases), which is unusual in most other forms of cholestatic liver disease in which GGT levels parallel other cholestatic markers.</p><p>The prothrombin time is usually normal. When prolonged, it is typically secondary to vitamin K deficiency from fat malabsorption due to severe steatorrhea or secondary to use of bile acid sequestrants (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>), rather than liver dysfunction. However, steatorrhea is usually modest, and nutritional requirements are generally easily met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>The primary bile acids&nbsp;are cholic and chenodeoxycholic&nbsp;acids, which are conjugated with glycine or taurine before being secreted into the&nbsp;bile. Cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid levels are increased, but cholic acid increases more than chenodeoxycholic acid, resulting in a marked elevation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">cholic/chenodeoxycholic</span> acid ratio (&gt;42 percent) compared with pregnant women without ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/39,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44</a>]. However, most women with an elevated bile acid ratio also have elevated total bile acid levels; as a result, obtaining a ratio does not enhance diagnostic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">glycine/taurine</span> conjugates of bile acids is decreased (&lt;1).

The laboratory&rsquo;s pregnancy-specific reference ranges for total serum bile acids in each trimester, if available, should be used to determine whether the level is elevated. Otherwise, the laboratory&rsquo;s cut-off for the general population is used. Total serum bile acid cut-off levels reported in the literature vary because of differences in laboratory methods, fasting status, population studied, and gestational age at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Postprandial serum total serum bile acid levels are generally higher than fasting levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Because pruritus can precede the rise in serum bile acids by several weeks, we suggest repeating laboratory tests weekly if total bile acid and aminotransferase levels are initially normal. However, if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> is started empirically, elevated bile acid and transaminase levels may never be detected.

There are multiple causes of abnormal liver biochemical and function tests; the detailed evaluation of patients with these abnormalities is reviewed separately.

Pruritus, the cardinal feature of ICP, helps distinguish ICP from other types of pregnancy-related disorders characterized by elevated transaminase levels (eg, HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia with severe features, acute fatty liver of pregnancy). However, ICP has been associated with development of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>] and acute fatty liver of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The lack of primary skin lesions in ICP helps to differentiate it from most pregnancy-specific pruritic dermatoses and skin conditions unrelated to pregnancy.

Transplacental gradients facilitate fetal clearance of bile acids in normal pregnancies, but are reversed in cholestatic pregnancies, which causes accumulation of bile acids in the fetal compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The main complications are increased risks for intrauterine demise, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm delivery (spontaneous and iatrogenic), and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (which appears to be associated with bile acids entering the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/32,54,57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,54,57-60</a>]. </p><p>The risk of fetal death is the most concerning issue. After excluding other possible attributable causes for stillbirth (eg, preeclampsia, diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal anomalies), the incidence of stillbirth after 37 weeks of gestation attributed to ICP is reported to be 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], but this figure is imprecise due to case selection, variations in interventions, and reporting bias. The risk of fetal demise appears to increase with higher bile acid levels (see <a href=\"#H3088647830\" class=\"local\">'Predictive value of maternal bile acid level'</a> below) and with advancing gestational age. In a series including 20 intrauterine fetal deaths associated with ICP, the median gestational age at fetal death was 38 weeks, and only two fetal deaths occurred before 37 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>The pathophysiology of fetal death in ICP is poorly understood, but may be related to the sudden development of a fetal arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] or vasospasm of the placental chorionic surface vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] induced by high levels of bile acids. Coexistent pregnancy complications (eg, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia) may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The incidence of prematurity varies greatly among studies (6 to 60 percent), and reflects increased rates of both induction of labor and spontaneous preterm labor, as well as a high rate of multiple gestations in patients with ICP. In one series of 61 infants born to women with ICP, the incidence of prematurity was 100 percent in multiple gestations versus 41 percent in singleton gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It is uncertain whether to avoid progesterone supplementation in women with a previous history of ICP. We make this decision with the patient after discussing individual risks and benefits, including consideration of her risk of preterm birth in the current pregnancy, the likely gestational age of a recurrent preterm birth with or without progesterone supplementation, and the risk and possible sequelae of recurrent ICP. If she decides to take progesterone, we would discontinue it if she develops ICP.

Pruritus, which may be intolerable, is often generalized but predominates on the palms and the soles of the feet and is worse at night. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ICP is based upon the presence of pruritus associated with elevated total serum bile acid levels, elevated aminotransferases, or both, and the absence of diseases that may produce similar laboratory findings and symptoms. Severe cholestasis is defined as bile acids over 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L,</span> and accounts for about 20 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus can precede the rise in serum bile acids by several weeks. However, if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> is started empirically, elevated bile acid and transaminase levels may never be detected. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of pruritus and hepatic dysfunction in pregnancy are addressed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96045 \">table 1</a>). Pruritus, the cardinal feature of ICP, helps distinguish ICP from other types of pregnancy-related disorders characterized by elevated transaminase levels (eg, HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia with severe features, acute fatty liver of pregnancy). The lack of primary skin lesions in ICP helps to differentiate it from most pregnancy-specific pruritic dermatoses and skin conditions unrelated to pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H259953428\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major complications of ICP are <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal:</span> increased risk for intrauterine demise, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm delivery (spontaneous and iatrogenic), and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (which appears to be associated with bile acids entering the lungs.

If ICP is diagnosed at &ge;37 weeks of gestation, we initiate delivery upon diagnosis. Before term, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (ursodiol or UDCA, a synthetic bile acid) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). UDCA relieves pruritus in about 70 percent of patients, may improve perinatal outcome, improves laboratory abnormalities associated with ICP in both the maternal and fetal compartments, has no known <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> toxicity UDCA, and is well-tolerated. The optimal dose has not been determined; 300 mg two or three times a day until delivery is reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Maternal treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We deliver most women diagnosed with ICP before term at 36 weeks of gestation, with earlier delivery in complicated cases.
