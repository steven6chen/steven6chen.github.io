The most common form of TGA is the dextro type (referred to as D-TGA) in which the ventricles are oriented so that the right ventricle is positioned to the right of the left ventricle and the origin of the aorta is anterior and rightward to the origin of the pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589 \">figure 1</a>). The anatomical defect of D-TGA leads to cyanotic heart disease as a result of two parallel circulations. The first sends deoxygenated systemic venous blood to the right atrium and back to the systemic circulation via the right ventricle and aorta, and the second sends oxygenated pulmonary venous blood to the left atrium and back to the lungs via the left ventricle and pulmonary artery.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of D-TGA of the great arteries will be presented here. The management and outcome of D-TGA are discussed separately.

However, a population-based surveillance study of all live births in five counties in Georgia from 1993 and 2005 reported a lower rate of 2.3 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. TGA accounts for approximately 3 percent of all congenital heart disease (CHD) disorders and almost 20 percent of all cyanotic CHD defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924629\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific developmental aspects that result in ventriculoarterial discordance in D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) are not fully delineated. It is hypothesized that the morphogenesis of D-TGA is due to the abnormal growth and development of the bilateral subarterial conus. In normal cardiac development, the subaortic conus and subpulmonary conus are present in the first month of gestation as the great arteries are positioned superior to the right ventricle. Typically, the subaortic conus is resorbed at approximately 30 to 34 days into gestation, which allows for migration of the aortic valve inferiorly and posteriorly into its normal position above the left ventricle. Subaortic conal resorption also leads to the characteristic fibrous continuity between the mitral and aortic valve within the left ventricle. The pulmonary valve retains its association with the right ventricle due to the persistence of the subpulmonary conus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In D-TGA, however, the subpulmonary conus is resorbed, which allows for posterior migration of the pulmonary valve and the development of fibrous continuity between the pulmonary and mitral valve. The unabsorbed subaortic conus forces the aortic valve anteriorly where it abnormally engages with the morphologic right ventricle. The range in the size and orientation of the subaortic conus is thought to create much of the variability of the coronary arteries' origins and course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30972826\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike many other forms of congenital heart disease (CHD), D-TGA is not associated with any one common genetic abnormality. As an example, 80 percent of patients with DiGeorge syndrome, which is associated with the 22q11 deletion, have conotruncal lesions, but few of these patients have D-TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Testing for the 22q11 deletion in patients with D-TGA will likely have a higher yield if there is also laterality or branching abnormalities of the aortic arch, which are more common in patients with DiGeorge syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H12143262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cardiac anomalies'</a>.)</p><p>D-TGA rarely occurs in other family members and the prevalence of CHD in siblings of affected children does not seem to be higher than that of the general population (0.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It also is associated with fewer noncardiac anomalies (&lt;10 percent) compared with other CHD defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924715\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal cardiac anatomy, the aorta is positioned posterior and to the right of the main pulmonary artery. Also, the morphologic right ventricle has a large outflow tract component known as the infundibulum or the conus arteriosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA), as noted above, the subpulmonary conus is absent and the subaortic conus fails to resorb resulting in the aorta being positioned anterior and slightly rightward of the pulmonary artery. These changes cause the aorta to arise from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle (ventriculoarterial discordance).</p><p>The dextro connotation of D-TGA refers to the looping of the ventricles during cardiac morphogenesis that positions the right ventricle to the right of the morphologic left ventricle. This provides a shorthand moniker to help differentiate this form of transposition from levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924878\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cardiac anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to ventriculoarterial discordance, there are other cardiac anomalies or functional defects that are often seen in patients with D-TGA. Simple D-TGA describes patients <strong>without</strong> another cardiac defect, whereas complex TGA describes those <strong>with</strong> an additional cardiac lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventricular septal defects</strong> &mdash; Ventricular septal defect (VSD) occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients with D-TGA. The associated VSD can be found in any region of the ventricular septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4432712\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal presentation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction</strong> &mdash; Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is common in D-TGA, occurring in up to 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The obstruction may be dynamic or anatomical:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with an intact ventricular septum, the systemic right ventricular pressure causes the interventricular septum to bow into the left ventricular cavity causing <strong>dynamic</strong> obstruction between the mitral valve and the septum. Surgical correction of the parallel circulations typically eliminates this functional obstruction. This form of obstruction is rare in neonates as elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and the presence of a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) result in near systemic pressure of the left ventricle, reducing this &ldquo;septal bulge&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with D-TGA and VSD are at greater risk for more severe <strong>anatomical</strong> left ventricular outflow tract obstruction such as pulmonary stenosis or atresia. This subset of D-TGA patients has a higher incidence of aortic arch obstruction including coarctation and interruption of the aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mitral and tricuspid valve abnormalities</strong> &mdash; Abnormalities of the mitral and tricuspid valves are more common when a VSD is present and have implications for surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Abnormalities include straddling tricuspid valves (septal chordal attachments of the tricuspid valve extend into the left ventricle) and overriding valves (valve allows direct flow into the left ventricle without straddling chordae). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries#H2923554\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of D-transposition of the great arteries&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coronary artery variations</strong> &mdash; Anatomy of the coronary arteries in patients with D-TGA is variable, and it is important to delineate the anatomy of the coronary arteries prior to surgical intervention, as it may impact the surgical approach and procedure. Coronary arteries are named based on the course that they follow. Normally, the left main coronary artery (LCA) arises from the left coronary ostium above the aortic valve. It divides into the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which courses along the epicardial surface of the interventricular septum, and the circumflex artery, which travels in the left atrioventricular groove, and posteriorly toward the crux of the heart. The right coronary artery (RCA), originating from the right coronary ostium, courses posteriorly in the right atrioventricular groove and typically gives rise to the posterior descending artery (90 percent of cases).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In D-TGA, the coronaries typically arise from the sinuses of Valsalva that face the pulmonary artery and follow the shortest course to their intended distribution. The &ldquo;usual&rdquo; coronary anatomy seen in two-thirds of patients with D-TGA entails the LCA originating from the anterior and leftward facing sinus, while the RCA arises from the posterior and rightward facing sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Coronary artery variations may include an unusual epicardial course, multiple coronary ostia arising from the same sinus of Valsalva, or the proximal course of a coronary artery passing between the two great vessels, which is described as intramural (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54020\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54020 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72341\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72341 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30972833\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) prior to surgical repair is physiologically uncorrected, which means that the systemic and pulmonary circulations are parallel circuits. Deoxygenated systemic venous blood drains appropriately into the right atrium and then is pumped from the right ventricle back to the systemic circulation via the aorta. Oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returns to the left atrium and ventricle, and is then recirculated to the lungs via the pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589 \">figure 1</a>). This circulation is incompatible with life unless there is communication between the two parallel circuits. Mixing can occur either <strong>intracardiac</strong> across a patent foramen ovale or a ventricular or atrial septal defect (VSD or ASD), or via <strong>extracardiac</strong> connections including a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or the bronchopulmonary collateral circulation.</p><p>The fetus tolerates the in-utero circulation of D-TGA without much difficulty. Oxygen-rich blood from the umbilical vein is largely directed from the right atrium across the fossa ovalis and into the left ventricle, where it is pumped into the pulmonary artery and across the ductus arteriosus (DA) into the systemic circulation. The vascular resistance provided by the placenta is lower than the pulmonary capillary bed, which allows for right-to-left blood flow through the ductus arteriosus (DA) and into the descending aorta. However, one potential fetal problem is that the normal flow of oxygen rich blood towards the head and neck vessels is disrupted by the inability to pump the oxygenated blood directly into the ascending aorta from the left ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;, section on 'Fetal circulation'</a>.)</p><p>Once the infant is born, the stability of the child will be largely determined based on the degree of mixing that occurs between the two parallel circulations. For viability, some degree of oxygenated pulmonary venous return must make its way to the systemic capillary bed (effective systemic blood flow), while a similar degree of systemic venous return must enter the pulmonary capillary system (effective pulmonary blood flow). Oxygen saturations and the degree of hypoxemia are largely based on the amount of intercirculatory mixing that occurs through the intracardiac and extracardiac connections. The goal of optimizing intercirculatory mixing is achieved by balancing the effective pulmonary and systemic blood flows. This mixing occurs most efficiently at the level of the atria as lower pressure differences allow for bidirectional flow across the atrial septum; flow can occur in both systole and diastole. Intracardiac (eg, VSDs) and extracardiac (eg, PDAs) mixing at other sites is more limited, due to the presence of larger pressure gradients, which typically direct blood in only one direction. Shunting of blood preferentially towards either the systemic or pulmonary circulation tend to results in clinical deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4432672\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4432680\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is one of the more difficult congenital heart defects (CHD) defects to detect by fetal ultrasound, some cases may be diagnosed, especially if sonographic screening includes views of the outflow tracts. (See <a href=\"#H30972840\" class=\"local\">'Fetal diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4432712\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postnatal clinical features of D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) are based on the degree of mixing between the two parallel circulations and the presence of other cardiac anomalies. Patients generally present during the neonatal period (ie, before 30 days of age).</p><p>The following clinical features are typically observed during physical examination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyanosis</strong> &mdash; The degree of cyanosis is determined by the amount of intercirculatory mixing, which is particularly affected by the presence and size of an atrial septal defect (ASD). A ventricular septal defect (VSD) may also result in improved intracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. Infants with mild cyanosis may lack other apparent signs and the lesion may be detected solely on the basis of a failed pulse oximetry screen. Cyanosis is not affected by exertion (eg, crying or feeding) or the use of supplemental oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Hyperoxia test'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intact Ventricular Septum &ndash; Neonates with an intact ventricular septum typically present with severe cyanosis during the newborn period. The severity is modified by the presence of other cardiac abnormalities that facilitate mixing, such as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interatrial shunting. These infants are at the greatest risk for neonatal death, especially when the PDA closes, resulting in decreased circulatory mixing. (See <a href=\"#H4432885\" class=\"local\">'Natural course'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>VSD &ndash; The size of the VSD dictates the amount of mixing that occurs between the two circulatory systems. Infants with a small VSD may get little additional mixing over those without a VSD. As a result, their presentation is usually similar to those with an intact ventricular septum. Infants with large VSDs may have mild or clinically inapparent cyanosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reverse differential cyanosis &ndash; Infants with D-TGA associated with pulmonary hypertension, coarctation of the aorta, or interrupted aortic arch may present with reverse differential cyanosis (ie, higher postductal saturations than preductal saturations). This is due to the right-to-left ductal shunting of blood into the descending aorta that is more fully saturated than that entering the ascending aorta. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tachypnea</strong> &mdash; Most patients have respiratory rates greater than 60 breaths per minute; however, they usually appear relatively comfortable without other signs of respiratory distress such as retractions, grunting, or flaring. Infants with large VSDs may present with more severe respiratory distress due to heart failure by three to four weeks of age.

Right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are normal in the first few days of life and may be the only findings present on a newborn ECG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography &ndash; A chest radiograph will often be normal in the first few days of life with a normal cardiothymic silhouette. The classic chest radiograph features a heart with an &ldquo;egg on a string&rdquo; appearance, which is thought to be a result of the great arteries forming a narrowed vascular pedicle when transposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Despite having marked hypoxemia, the pulmonary vascular markings are often normal or increased in D-TGA. Infants with a large VSD or a straddling tricuspid valve may develop signs of excessive pulmonary blood flow, cardiomegaly, and congestive heart failure on chest radiograph after a few days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization &ndash; Angiography is seldom required to make the diagnosis of D-TGA. However, coronary angiography remains the gold standard for elucidating coronary arteries' courses and origins and is used at times for patients with coronary anatomy that cannot be determined confidently with echocardiography prior to surgical intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most important role for cardiac catheterization in patients with D-TGA is performance of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) to increase mixing between the two circulatory systems. This procedure is performed in patients with severe hypoxemia as a consequence of inadequate mixing and has extended survival for these infants until surgical palliation can be performed.

This defect results in the creation of two parallel circulations, in which deoxygenated systemic venous blood returns to the right atrium and is sent back to the systemic circulation via the right ventricle and aorta, while simultaneously oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returning to the left atrium is pumped back to the lungs via the left ventricle and pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589 \">figure 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H30972805\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the specific mechanism that causes D-TGA is unknown, it appears that the underlying pathophysiology is due to the abnormal growth and development of the bilateral subarterial conus. (See <a href=\"#H2924629\" class=\"local\">'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike other congenital heart disease (CHD) defects, D-TGA is not associated with any genetic abnormality and rarely occurs in other family members. D-TGA is also less frequently associated with noncardiac anomalies compared with other CHD defects. (See <a href=\"#H30972826\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other cardiac anomalies that are often seen in patients with D-TGA include ventricular septal defect (VSD), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, aortic arch obstruction, mitral and tricuspid valve abnormalities, and coronary artery anatomical variations. These defects may impact cardiac function and mixing between the two circulatory systems, and have an impact on surgical approach. (See <a href=\"#H2924878\" class=\"local\">'Other cardiac anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-TGA is one of the more difficult CHD defects to detect by fetal ultrasound. Prenatal diagnosis is enhanced if sonographic screening includes views of the outflow tracts. (See <a href=\"#H30972840\" class=\"local\">'Fetal diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal clinical findings vary based on the degree of mixing between the two circulatory systems and the presence of other cardiac anomalies. Typical findings include cyanosis and tachypnea. Murmurs are not a prominent feature unless there is a VSD or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H4432712\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The postnatal diagnosis of D-TGA is based on clinical suspicion of an underlying cyanotic congenital heart defect and is confirmed by echocardiography.
