This condition was previously called hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which reflects its initial description in newborns, before tools for assessing fetal hemolysis were available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rh(D) disease</strong> &ndash; HDFN due to maternal alloantibodies to the Rh(D) antigen is also called Rh disease of the newborn, Rhesus disease, Rh(D) disease, and Rh(D) HDN. This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Rhesus D alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alloantibodies other than anti-Rh(D)</strong> &ndash; Importantly, there are alloantibodies other than anti-Rh(D) that can cause HDFN. These include antibodies directed against other Rh antigens, including C, c, E, and e; and antigens from other blood group systems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydrops fetalis</strong> &ndash; The most severe manifestation of HDFN that occurs in utero is hydrops fetalis, in which severe anemia and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen lead to heart failure and generalized edema (hydrops).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593784\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal alloantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of HDFN requires a maternal exposure to an RBC antigen not expressed on maternal RBCs and generation of an alloantibody. Potential sources of exposure include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusion</strong> &ndash; Previous blood transfusion to the mother is common route of exposure to RBC antigens. Transfusion of RBCs is most commonly implicated, but platelets, which may contain a small amount of RBCs, may also be responsible. Transfusion is an especially common route for the development of antibodies against the antigen K of the Kell blood group system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A likely reason is the lack of routine testing of donor blood for antigens other than ABO and Rh(D). Thus, some women who are negative for the K antigen of the Kell blood group will develop alloantibodies to K if they receive K-positive blood products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetomaternal bleeding</strong> &ndash; Fetomaternal bleeding is another common cause of exposure to RBC antigens. Transplacental fetomaternal bleeding can occur anytime in pregnancy and may be related to miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, antepartum vaginal bleeding (eg, placenta previa, abruptio placenta), abdominal trauma, or delivery (livebirth or stillbirth). It may also occur in the absence of a recognizable inciting event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shared needles</strong> &ndash; Injection with needles contaminated with another person's blood has been reported to cause alloimmunization to Rh(D) in intravenous drug users; thus, exposure is considered a potential cause of sensitization to other RBC antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p>The likelihood of alloimmunization increases with greater volumes of allogeneic blood to which the woman is exposed; thus, transfusion is more likely to cause alloimmunization than fetomaternal bleeding. However, exposure to as little as 0.5 mL of allogeneic blood can cause alloimmunization.</p><p>Following maternal sensitization to an RBC antigen through any of the above mechanisms, subsequent exposure during a future pregnancy will elicit an antibody response of variable intensity and timing.</p><p>To cause hemolysis of fetal cells, the maternal alloantibody must be transported across the placenta; thus, antibodies of the IgG class are usually implicated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBC antigens of the Lewis, I, and P blood groups often elicit IgM antibodies, which are not transported across the placenta and thus are not clinically significant causes of HDFN. (See <a href=\"#H1594091\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of alloantibodies in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies of the Cromer blood group system can bind to a placental protein (decay accelerating factor), which traps them in the placenta and prevents them from entering the fetal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Antibody specificity (ie, the antigen to which the antibody is directed) and titer (a measure of antibody concentration in maternal blood) are helpful in estimating the risk of HDFN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104946\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104946 \">algorithm 1</a>). Antibodies to certain blood group systems are more likely to cause severe HDFN, as listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>). The most commonly seen antibodies with the potential to cause severe HDFN besides anti-Rh(D) include anti-K, anti-Rh(c), and anti-Rh(E). A high antibody titer is more predictive of severe fetal anemia than a low titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1594091\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of alloantibodies in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>Some antibody subclasses, such as IgG1 and IgG3, are more efficient at causing hemolysis than others. IgG1 is transported across the placenta earlier and in larger amounts than IgG3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies do not normally play a significant role in RBC hemolysis. Antibody subtype classification is generally used for research purposes and not for clinical management.</p><p>Although not associated with HDFN, naturally occurring antibodies to some RBC antigens can develop when the antigens are similar to epitopes present on micro-organisms (ie, molecular mimicry). The most common example is the ABO blood group antigens A and B. Anti-A and anti-B are present in virtually all individuals who lack the corresponding antigen, due to exposure to gut bacteria; however, these antibodies are IgM <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgA and thus do not cross the placenta. In contrast, alloimmunization to A or B during a previous pregnancy can lead to production of IgG antibodies to A or B capable of causing hemolysis of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> RBCs (see <a href=\"#H14961890\" class=\"local\">'ABO'</a> below). Anti-M and anti-N, also due to gut micro-organisms, are present in 2 to 3 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1594434\" class=\"local\">'MNS'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H161914480\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal/neonatal anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal or neonatal anemia can only develop if the maternal antibody crosses the placenta and binds its cognate antigen on fetal RBCs. Thus, if the fetus has not inherited the implicated antigen, or the antigen is one that does not develop on fetal RBCs until after birth, hemolysis cannot occur.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBC antigens are inherited from both parents. If the father is homozygous for the gene encoding the antigen, all of his children will be antigen-positive; if he is heterozygous, approximately half will be antigen-positive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBC antigens are expressed at various stages during gestation, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some antigens are not well developed on fetal or neonatal RBCs and therefore are not associated with HDFN; examples include the Lutheran system antigen Lu(b) and the Cartwright antigen Yta.</p><p/><p>Once a maternal antibody binds to fetal RBCs, the cells can be phagocytized by reticuloendothelial macrophages in the spleen or liver, causing fetal anemia; this form of RBC destruction is referred to as extravascular hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In more severe forms of HDFN, intravascular hemolysis also occurs (ie, direct lysis of RBCs within the circulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In most forms of HDFN, RBC production (erythropoiesis) is increased in order to compensate for hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A major exception occurs in HDFN due to K alloimmunization because antibodies against K antigen cause hemolysis <strong>and</strong> suppress erythropoiesis, the latter via destruction of RBC progenitor and precursor cells in the bone marrow. Anti-K thus leads to earlier and more severe anemia than many other alloantibodies.</p><p>After delivery, hemolysis can continue due to persistent maternal antibody in the neonatal circulation. Maternal antibody levels decline over approximately 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia is not an important problem for the fetus, because bilirubin resulting from hemolysis is transported back to the maternal circulation, where it is conjugated and cleared. After delivery, however, conjugation of bilirubin depends on the newborn liver, which cannot conjugate bilirubin efficiently. Thus, hyperbilirubinemia is a concern after delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1594091\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF ALLOANTIBODIES IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, alloantibodies to non-Rh(D) red blood cell (RBC) antigens are seen in approximately 1.5 to 2.5 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other than Rh(D), the antigens most commonly implicated in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) are Kell, Rh(c), and Rh(E). The likelihood that alloantibodies will cause HDFN increases as the number of at-risk pregnancies increases. The distribution of antibody specificities depends on the population sampled and the sampling methods used.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large prospective series that included over 300,000 consecutive pregnancies, first trimester screening revealed an alloantibody to an antigen other than Rh(D) in 1002 women (approximately 1 percent), accounting for approximately one-quarter of all alloantibodies in this series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most common were anti-Rh(E), anti-K, and anti-Rh(c). Clinically significant antibodies (eg, those requiring in utero or neonatal transfusion) to antigens other than Rh(D) occurred in 21 of 567 fetuses at risk (3.7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 110 pregnant mothers with 111 at-risk fetuses and maternal antibody titers of 16 or greater, antibodies to Rh(D), K, Rh(E), and Rh(c) were present in 84, 18, 8, and 3 fetuses, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>In East Asia, the relative frequency of non-Rh(D) HDFN is higher because the proportion of Rh(D)-negative individuals in the population is especially low.</p><p>Some &quot;low frequency&quot; antigens are present in such a small percentage of the population that they are not present in reagent screening cells used to detect maternal alloantibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>). Alloantibodies to these antigens may be missed by standard maternal screening, and in rare cases in which they cause hemolysis, the problem may not be detected until delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14961823\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOANTIBODIES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HDFN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, maternal antibodies will not cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) if they cannot cross the placenta (eg, IgM), or if they are directed against an antigen not expressed on fetal red blood cells (RBCs) (see <a href=\"#H1593766\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and pathogenesis'</a> above). This includes antibodies to the Lewis blood group antigens, the I antigens, and the P antigen P1. Maternal titers and fetal assessment for anemia are unnecessary for pregnancies associated with these alloantibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14961834\"><span class=\"h2\">Lewis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lewis antigens are not associated with HDFN. This includes Le(a), Le(b), and four rare associated antigens. Antibodies to Lewis antigens are IgM, and fetal RBCs lack Lewis antigens, which develop later in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, Lewis antibodies commonly are detected during pregnancy and often may lead to confusion regarding HDFN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14961841\"><span class=\"h2\">I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The I antigens are not associated with HDFN. The I blood group includes &quot;I&quot; and &quot;i&quot; antigens, neither of which has been associated with HDFN. Fetal and newborn RBCs strongly express the i antigen, with only small amounts of I antigen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14961848\"><span class=\"h2\">P1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The P1 antigen often elicits an IgM alloantibody in women who express P2; anti-P1 is not associated with HDFN. In contrast, women who have the very rare &quot;p&quot; phenotype can produce clinically significant alloantibodies to other P antigens. (See <a href=\"#H1594566\" class=\"local\">'P'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14961855\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOANTIBODIES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH HDFN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to blood group systems that have been associated with hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>); however, the presence of antibodies to these blood group systems does not necessarily result in HDFN. Some of these blood group systems are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1594361\"><span class=\"h2\">Kell</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most antigenic of the Kell group is K; K is present in approximately 9 percent of Caucasian blood donors. K-sensitized pregnancies are responsible for approximately 10 percent of severe cases of HDFN. In a large series that included 19 K-sensitized pregnancies, severe HDFN was seen in five (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other Kell antigens include k, Kp(a), Kp(b), Ko, Js(a), Js(b), and a large number of other rare antigens; these are rarely a cause of Kell incompatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The genotype frequencies in Caucasians are approximately: Kk (8.7 percent), kk (91.1 percent), and KK (0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. By comparison, the frequencies for African-Americans are Kk (2 percent), and kk (98 percent), and KK is extremely rare.</p><p>Blood transfusion is likely the most common mechanism of K sensitization in reproductive-age women. Antigen testing for K antigens is not routinely performed on blood donors in the United States, although it is in some countries (eg, Australia, the Netherlands) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one series, 8 of 12 K-sensitized women with K-positive babies had a prior blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Alloimmunization during a previous pregnancy may account for anti-K in women who have not received a transfusion.</p><p>HDFN due to anti-K can be severe. One reason for this is the ability of anti-K to cause destruction of red blood cell (RBC) precursors and maturing erythrocytes in the bone marrow as well as circulating mature fetal RBCs (see <a href=\"#H161914480\" class=\"local\">'Fetal/neonatal anemia'</a> above). Anti-K can be particularly troublesome because the titer of the alloantibody correlates poorly with the likelihood of fetal anemia, and the severity of anemia can change dramatically over the course of a single week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Hydrops fetalis can develop before the third trimester. This was illustrated in a series of 20 affected fetuses and infants among 311 K-sensitized women, in which three fetuses required intrauterine fetal transfusions for severe anemia or hydrops, one required an early delivery and multiple neonatal exchange transfusions, four required neonatal exchange transfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phototherapy, and 12 did well without any treatment for anemia or hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24488508\"><span class=\"h2\">Rh(c) and Rh(E)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Rh system includes many antigens other than Rh(D), the most clinically significant of which are &quot;c&quot; and &quot;E.&quot; Other Rh antigens include &quot;C&quot; and &quot;e&quot;; there is no &quot;d&quot; antigen. Importantly, administration of anti-Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> does not protect the mother from developing antibodies directed against these other Rh antigens.

This approach is consistent with recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which advise that the care of patients with non-Rh(D) alloantibodies should be the same as for women with Rh(D) alloimmunization, with the possible exception of Kell sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H746309\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine screening for antibodies to red blood cell (RBC) antigens, as well as ABO testing, should be performed early in pregnancy, typically at the first prenatal visit; this will include screening for anti-Rh(D) as well as a number of other antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Testing is done by incubating maternal serum with selected RBCs, known as the antibody screen, by the indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) method. This testing is highly accurate and relatively inexpensive. If no clinically important alloantibodies are detected, antepartum antibody screening usually is not repeated, because clinically significant, late-onset alloimmunization is rare, on the order of 0.18 percent or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/11,48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,48-53</a>].</p><p>The results of maternal antibody screening and antibody identification are compared with any prior data that are available.

Relevant information includes a history of HDFN in previous pregnancies with the same biologic father; the likelihood of HDFN for the implicated antigen specificity; the maternal alloantibody class (IgG versus IgM) and level of antibody in maternal plasma; and when appropriate, determination fetal RBC antigen status. Antibody titration provides information about whether the antibody concentration is above a critical threshold value.

A higher titer correlates with a higher antibody concentration in maternal blood, and an increasing titer suggests ongoing stimulation of maternal antibody production. The antibody titer is the reciprocal of the greatest dilution of maternal serum at which the antibody agglutinates RBCs that express the corresponding antigen. It is calculated from measuring RBC agglutination with serial dilutions of maternal plasma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Titration is used if a maternal alloantibody is found and the fetus is potentially at risk for expressing the antigen. A titer above a critical threshold value predicts an increased likelihood of HDFN, and HDFN is extremely unlikely at a titer below a critical threshold. However, the titer does not correlate linearly with the risk of HDFN or the severity of hemolysis, which provides the rationale for additional testing if the titer exceeds the critical threshold. Titration is considered unreliable for predicting the likelihood of HDFN if a prior pregnancy with the same father was associated with HDFN, and a high antibody titer does not correlate well with the severity of hemolysis in any setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Titration of a clinically important maternal alloantibody can be done simultaneously with determination of fetal antigen status or sequentially, depending on the clinical setting. Both pieces of information are used in deciding whether serial monitoring for fetal anemia is needed.</p><p/><p>If a past pregnancy was complicated by HDFN, subsequent pregnancies are at high risk of recurrence and antibody titration is not needed. However, the converse is not true; a previous unaffected pregnancy cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of an affected fetus, because the father may be heterozygous for the antigen, there may be a different father, or sensitization to the antigen may have occurred at the time of a prior delivery or miscarriage.</p><p>The critical titer is the titer below which the risk of HDFN is unlikely and fetal testing or monitoring is not required. The critical titer is lower for anti-K (Kell) than for other antibodies. An antibody titer at or above the critical titer should prompt noninvasive monitoring for fetal anemia if the fetus carries the corresponding antigen (the fetal antigen status should be determined by amniocentesis if it is not already known) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104946\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104946 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most laboratories follow publications from the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), which consider 16 the critical titer. It is generally agreed that additional fetal evaluation can be deferred at titers of 4 or below. A titer of 16 should prompt close fetal monitoring (eg, with fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity [MCA-PSV]), if the fetus is antigen-positive, because rare cases of severe fetal anemia occur at this level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An exception is a K (Kell) alloimmunized pregnancy, in which the correlation of the titer and risk of severe HDFN is especially weak. Thus, some experts use a lower threshold for K-sensitized pregnancies (eg, a critical titer of 8). One case of fetal hydrops has been reported in the second trimester when the maternal titer was 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The rationale is that the risk of severe anemia is greater due to hemolysis plus impaired erythropoiesis. (See <a href=\"#H1594361\" class=\"local\">'Kell'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>As long as the antibody titer remains <strong>below </strong>the critical titer, additional evaluation of the fetus can be deferred and the patient evaluated with serial antibody titers. The interval between titers varies from two to four weeks, depending upon the previous titer measurement and the gestational age. Titers should be drawn more frequently when the titer is borderline or rising and in the third trimester when the risk of erythroblastosis is highest. Except in K (Kell)-affected pregnancies, it is not necessary to perform serial titers before 18 to 20 weeks of gestation, because of the low risk of severe fetal anemia early in pregnancy.</p><p>Once noninvasive assessment of fetal anemia is initiated, management decisions are based on this assessment rather than on laboratory testing of the maternal antibody.

These autoantibodies generally cause a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) and may be present in the mother's plasma, complicating the interpretation of <strong>allo</strong>antibody screening. AIHA must be distinguished from the nonpathologic positive DAT, which occurs in 1 in 1000 hospitalized patients and in 1 in 36,000 normal blood donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Warm AIHA is often exacerbated during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. In some cases, the autoantibody may cross the placenta and cause shortened survival of the fetal RBCs. Occasionally, the autoantibody mimics allo-anti-Rh(e), which may be transported across the placenta. However, we are unaware of cases of severe HDFN; thus, serial fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) scans are not needed in this setting.</p><p>If sufficient autoantibodies are transported across the placenta to cause anemia in the Rh(e)-positive fetus, exchange transfusion may be required shortly after delivery. Since only approximately 1 in 20,000 Rh(D)-negative units are also Rh(e)-negative, RBC units that are negative for both Rh(D) and Rh(e) may not be available.

Examples include the Kell blood group antigens k or Kp(b), U antigen, and the Colton blood group antigen Co(a). Identifying the antibody specificity, as well as any underlying clinically significant antibodies being masked by its presence, in a timely manner is essential so that donor blood is available should fetal transfusion be required prior to delivery or the mother <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the newborn require transfusion postpartum.</p><p>Options in this setting include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the mother is medically able, she may donate one to two units of RBCs during the second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother's siblings can be tested.

Consideration should be given to fractionating the unit to allow for more efficient use early in gestation. Alternatively, the transfusion service can contact the American Rare Donor File to inquire if frozen units lacking the high frequency antigen in question can be found. Such units could then be held or shipped to the local facility and stored for future use.</p><p>If compatible blood cannot be obtained and intrauterine or exchange transfusion becomes imperative, group O red blood cells that are heterozygous for the high frequency antigen (eg, K+k+ when anti-k is present) are preferred to blood from a donor who is homozygous for the implicated antigen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1594009\"><span class=\"h2\">IVF/donor egg/surrogacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of pregnancies involving a donor gamete or a gestational surrogate is based on the predicted antigen status of the fetus and the known antibody status of the gestational carrier.

Combined data from several studies that included cases managed by fetal transfusion reported fetal survival of 94 and 74 percent for nonhydropic and hydropic fetuses, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Comparable data have been presented for Kell-sensitized pregnancies, although some series report a lower survival rate for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) due to Kell than for Rh(D) sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In a large series of over 300,000 pregnancies, those newborns at risk of HDFN due to alloantibodies other than anti-Rh(D) were more likely to have icterus than those not at risk (25 versus 10 percent) and to be treated with phototherapy (17 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>There remains a very small risk of HDFN in pregnancies in which an alloantibody was not detected on first trimester screening. In the large series of over 300,000 pregnancies, eight cases of severe HDFN that occurred in patients with a negative screen were due to anti-Rh(c) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-Rh(E), resulting in an overall risk of antibody screen-negative severe HDFN of 2 in 100,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Fetal RBC antigens arise from expression of a paternally inherited gene. A maternal alloantibody corresponding to the fetal antigen must be transported across the placenta; therefore, IgG, but not IgM, can cause fetal hemolysis. Fetal anemia occurs primarily via phagocytosis of antibody-coated RBCs by reticuloendothelial macrophages in the fetal spleen and liver. (See <a href=\"#H1593766\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDFN can result from alloantibodies to antigens other than Rh(D), including other Rh antigens and antigens from other blood group systems. Maternal alloantibodies to non-Rh(D) antigens are seen in approximately 1.5 to 2.5 percent of pregnancies. The most commonly implicated antigens are Rh(c), Rh(E), and the Kell blood group K antigen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>). Of the blood group systems other than Rh, the Kell system, especially the K antigen, causes earlier and more severe HDFN than others. (See <a href=\"#H1594091\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of alloantibodies in pregnancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1594361\" class=\"local\">'Kell'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation, prevention, and management of Rh(D) alloimmunization in pregnancy is discussed in detail separately.

Individuals with a history of HDFN require further testing to determine the antibody class and specificity and the potential father's antigen status. There are few interventions that can be used to prevent HDFN in a woman with an alloantibody and a father who carries the corresponding antigen (eg, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, gestational surrogate, donor insemination). (See <a href=\"#H161917249\" class=\"local\">'Prepregnancy counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine screening for antibodies to RBC antigens, as well as ABO testing, should be performed early in pregnancy, typically at the first prenatal visit; this will include screening for anti-Rh(D) as well as a number of other antibodies. Importantly, administration of Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> to an Rh(D)-negative mother at 28 weeks gestation should not be delayed while performing the evaluation for other non-Rh(D) alloantibodies. If no clinically important alloantibodies are detected, antepartum antibody screening usually is not repeated. (See <a href=\"#H746309\" class=\"local\">'Antibody screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the maternal antibody screen identifies an alloantibody, its potential for causing clinically significant hemolysis is assessed based on the antibody class (eg, IgG versus IgM), antibody level (eg, quantification, titer), antibody specificity (eg, Kell, previously implicated antigen, other antigen), and presence of the implicated antigen on fetal RBCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104946\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104946 \">algorithm 1</a>). Of note, although it is important to know whether the antibody is above a threshold value, the antibody level is not predictive of the likelihood or severity of disease.
