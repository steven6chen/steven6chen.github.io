Diarrhea is not a disease but is a symptom of a number of illnesses. Although diarrhea is common and rarely serious, it is important to understand when to seek help. Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which alters the child's natural balance of water, and to electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) imbalance. It can be serious if not treated promptly.</p><p>This topic will review the major issues related to diarrhea in children. A brief summary is provided below. Diarrhea in adults is discussed separately. A topic that discusses nausea and vomiting in children is also available. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Summary'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIARRHEA DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal frequency and consistency of bowel movements varies with a child's age and diet, and the definition of diarrhea varies accordingly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is normal for young infants to have up to 3 to 10 stools per day, although this varies depending upon the child's diet (breast milk versus formula; breastfed children usually have more frequent stools). Older infants, toddlers, and children normally have one to two bowel movements per day. Diarrhea is defined as an increase in stool frequency to twice the usual number per day in infants or three or more loose or watery stools per day in older children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Consistency and color</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consistency and color of a child's stool normally changes with age, which highlights the importance of knowing what is normal for your child. Young infants, especially those who are breastfeeding, usually have soft stools. Their stools may be yellow, green, or brown, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appear to contain seeds or small curds.</p><p>All children's stools can vary as a result of their diet. Development of stools that are runny, watery, or contain mucus is a significant change that should be monitored. The presence of visible blood or black stools is never normal and always requires medical attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bloody stools in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prolonged history of diarrhea (one week or longer) is evaluated and treated differently than an acute case of diarrhea (lasting less than one week). The discussion below will focus on acute, rather than chronic, diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIARRHEA CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of acute diarrhea is a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, side effects of antibiotics, and infections not related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system. In addition, there are many less common causes of diarrhea.</p><p>Viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections are all contagious, and <span class=\"nowrap\">parents/caretakers</span> can assist in preventing spread of the infection. Children are considered contagious for as long as they have diarrhea. However, depending on the microorganism, some children can spread diarrhea even before they develop symptoms, and a minority, with specific types of infections, will continue to spread diarrhea pathogens for weeks, months, or years after their symptoms resolve. Microorganisms causing diarrhea are spread from hand to mouth; hand washing and separating food-handling and feces disposal (eg, not changing diapers in the kitchen) are very important to preventing infection in family and other contacts. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Preventing spread'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infection is the leading cause of diarrhea in children and is seen most commonly in the winter months in temperate climates. Symptoms of viral infection can include fever (temperature higher than 38&deg;C or 100.4&deg;F), watery diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, lack of appetite, headache, and muscle aches.</p><p>Viral infection usually begins 12 hours to 5 days after exposure and resolves within three to seven days. No specific treatment is available for viral causes of diarrhea. Children with diarrhea from viral infections are best treated with supportive measures (oral rehydration solution; age-appropriate diet, limiting foods high in fat and simple sugars; and rest). Vomiting is the predominant feature of gastroenteritis caused by <em>Norovirus</em>, and medicines to prevent vomiting may be prescribed to assist the child with oral rehydration. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Home care of diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial infection is sometimes hard to distinguish from viral infection. Bacterial infections are more common in locations where there is unsafe drinking water and poor handling of sewage. Persistent high fever (higher than 40&deg;C or 104&deg;F) and diarrhea that is bloody or contains mucus are more common with bacterial diarrhea. Most children with bacterial infection do not require antibiotics and will improve with time and supportive measures. However, treatment may be necessary in certain situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Parasitic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parasitic infections are more common in locations where there is unsafe drinking water and poor handling of sewage. Infection with a parasite is uncommon in developed countries but may be seen in children who have recently ingested contaminated water or who have traveled to or lived in developing countries. Diarrhea from parasitic infections may last for weeks to months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Giardia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic-associated diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of antibiotics can cause diarrhea in both children and adults. The diarrhea is usually mild and typically does not cause dehydration or weight loss. In most cases, antibiotics should not be stopped and the child's diet does not need to be changed. The diarrhea usually resolves one to two days after antibiotics are finished. Contact a health care provider if a child on antibiotics has diarrhea that is severe (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Frequency'</a> above), contains blood, or does not resolve after the antibiotic is stopped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-associated-diarrhea-caused-by-clostridium-difficile-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIARRHEA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parents of many children with diarrhea appropriately do not seek medical evaluation, and others receive advice by telephone. The evaluation of diarrhea in children who do seek medical evaluation requires a careful review of medical history, a physical examination, and, infrequently, diagnostic testing. The clinician will perform a thorough examination to evaluate the general condition of your child because there are some infections unrelated to the bowels (such as an ear infection) that can cause diarrhea.</p><p>Many tests are available to diagnose the cause of diarrhea and to determine the severity of dehydration, although most children will not require testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HOME CARE OF DIARRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are some simple recommendations to help care for children with diarrhea at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been much confusion and folklore about optimal foods for children with diarrhea. Fortunately, a number of studies have examined recommendations that are proven to be effective and these recommendations have been consistent since the 1990s.</p><p>Children who are not dehydrated should continue to eat a regular diet, and infants who are breastfeeding should continue to do so unless the parent(s) is told otherwise by their clinician. Dehydrated children require rehydration (replacement of lost fluid), and suitable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> are the most physiologic. After being rehydrated, severely affected children will be able to resume a normal diet. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Oral rehydration therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific suggestions for children who are not dehydrated and are tolerating a regular diet include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with diarrhea tolerate full-strength cow's milk products. It is not necessary to dilute or avoid milk products, except in children with known allergies to cow's milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommended foods include a combination of complex carbohydrates (rice, wheat, potatoes, bread), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. High-fat foods are more difficult to absorb and should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The unnecessary restriction of a child's diet to clear liquids or the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) results in inadequate intake of nutrients (calories <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein). Giving only clear liquids for several days can actually prolong diarrhea (called &quot;starvation stools&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sports drinks (sample brand name: Gatorade) should be avoided because they have too much sugar and have inappropriate electrolyte levels for the patient with diarrhea. If fruit juice is to be given, we suggest starting with half-strength apple juice (apple juice mixed with an equal amount of water) and then letting the child drink whatever they prefer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild dehydration is common in children with diarrhea. Signs and symptoms of mild dehydration include a slightly dry mouth, increased thirst, and slightly decreased urine output (one wet diaper or void in six hours). Common features of moderate or severe dehydration include markedly decreased urination (less than one wet diaper or void in six hours), lack of tears when crying, dry mouth, and sunken eyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52953 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral rehydration therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was developed as a safer, less expensive, and easier alternative to intravenous fluids. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) contains glucose (a sugar) and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) that are lost in children with vomiting and diarrhea. Various rehydration solutions are available. Parents should check with a health care provider to determine which solution is preferred. A child who is moderately or severely dehydrated needs to be evaluated by a health care provider. If a child refuses to accept ORS because of vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> becomes moderately to severely dehydrated, as indicated by decreased urination (&gt;6 hours since passing most recent urine), lethargy, or other features, the child requires professional evaluation and treatment.</p><p>ORT does not cure diarrhea, but it does help to treat the dehydration that often accompanies it. ORS can be purchased at most grocery stores and pharmacies in the United States without a prescription. A few widely available brands include Pedialyte, Enfalyte, and Rehydralyte, although generic brands are equally effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70752 \">table 2</a>). Gelatin, tea, rice water, fruit juice, and other beverages are not recommended for use as ORT in children with diarrhea and signs of dehydration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52953 \">table 1</a>). Parents should not try to prepare ORS recipes at home because the formulas must be exact.</p><p>ORS may be given at home to a child who is mildly dehydrated, refusing to eat a normal diet, or has vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. If needed, ORS can be given in frequent, small amounts by oral syringe, spoon, bottle, or cup over three to four hours. A pediatrician may provide specific instructions for oral rehydration to their patients. One method is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents should first measure out the total amount to be given with a standardized medicine syringe or measuring cup or spoon, rather than a regular cup or spoon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total volume of 5 teaspoons per pound, or 50 milliliters per kilogram, should be given over four hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62163 \">table 3</a>). For a 20 pound child, this would equal 100 teaspoons; for a 9 kg child, this would equal 450 milliliters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluid can be given by teaspoonfuls or oral syringe (approximately equal to 5 milliliters each) every one to two minutes, or as tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the total amount has been given, a normal diet can be resumed.</p><p/><p>A child who refuses to drink or vomits immediately after drinking ORS should be monitored closely for worsening dehydration. Children who are not dehydrated may drink ORS after every episode of vomiting to prevent dehydration. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications such as antibiotics and antidiarrheal agents are generally not necessary and could be harmful for infants or children with diarrhea. Rarely, antibiotics may be used in cases of bacterial infection when a specific cause of the diarrhea has been found or is strongly suspected, particularly after recent travel. Inappropriate use of antibiotics will not improve diarrhea. Furthermore, antibiotics can cause side effects and lead to development of antibiotic resistance.</p><p>Antidiarrheal agents (including Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, and Kaopectate) are not recommended for infants or children, since the benefits do not outweigh the risks. One risk of using an antidiarrheal agent is that it could mask worsening symptoms and delay treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are &quot;healthy&quot; bacteria (called probiotics) that may help reduce the duration of diarrhea (by about 12 to 30 hours). Some of these are available in drug stores without a prescription. While it is not unreasonable to use them, their overall benefit is small and they can be expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING SPREAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents with children who have diarrhea should be cautious to avoid spreading infection to themselves, their family, and friends. Care with hand washing, diapering, and keeping sick children out of school or day care until the diarrhea is gone are a few ways to limit the number of people exposed to the infection.</p><p>Hand washing is an essential and very effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Hands should ideally be wet with water and plain or antimicrobial soap and rubbed together for 15 to 30 seconds. Special attention should be paid to the fingernails, between the fingers, and the wrists. Hands should be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a single-use towel.</p><p>Alcohol-based hand rubs are a good alternative for disinfecting hands if a sink is not available However, alcohol-based hand rubs do not prevent all types of diarrhea (eg, <em>Norovirus, Clostridium difficile</em>). Hand rubs should be spread over the entire surface of hands, fingers, and wrists until dry, and may be used several times. Hand rubs are available as a liquid or wipe in small, portable sizes that are easy to carry in a pocket or handbag. When a sink is available, visibly soiled hands should be washed with soap and water.</p><p>Hands should be cleaned after changing a diaper or touching any soiled item. They should also be washed before and after preparing food and eating, after going to the bathroom, after handling garbage or dirty laundry, after touching animals or pets, and after blowing the nose or sneezing.</p><p>Children who have diarrhea should not swim in swimming pools. Those who are not toilet trained should avoid swimming in swimming pools for one week after the diarrhea has recovered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP FOR DIARRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a list of signs and symptoms that are worrisome and require <strong>immediate</strong> medical attention:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refusal to eat or drink anything for more than a few hours in infants and for more than eight hours in children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to severe dehydration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain that comes and goes or is severe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior changes, including lethargy or decreased responsiveness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most episodes of acute diarrhea resolve on their own.
