However, it should be remembered that the diagnostic criteria for various disease states have historically been built on long experience with the physical examination, while scanning procedures have been available for a shorter period of time. Thus, the clinical or diagnostic significance of a spleen that is modestly enlarged on scan but is not palpable (ie, &quot;scanomegaly&quot;) is uncertain.</p><p>As an example, in polycythemia vera, palpable splenomegaly was a major diagnostic criterion according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group.

The spleen weighs 80 to 200 grams and 70 to 180 grams in the normal adult male and female, respectively, averaging about 150 grams, or approximately 0.2 percent of body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is not usually palpable, but may be felt in children, adolescents, and some adults, especially those of asthenic build.</p><p>The spleen is a major lymphopoietic organ, containing approximately 25 percent of the total lymphoid mass of the body; this component, as well as components of the monocyte-macrophage system, can react and enlarge quickly after the onset of infection or inflammation. Under such circumstances, a spleen enlarged to scan but not palpably enlarged may be a nonspecific marker of inflammation similar to an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or other acute phase reactants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A major function of the spleen is to remove particulates (eg, opsonized bacteria, antibody-coated cells) from the blood stream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This function is most apparent when the spleen has been removed, since splenectomized patients are susceptible to bacterial sepsis, especially with encapsulated organisms. This function is also associated with trapping and destruction antibody-coated platelets or red cells in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Role of the spleen in host defense'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment#H10445438\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>The spleen also serves as a quality control mechanism for red cells, removing senescent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poorly deformable red cells from the circulation. This &quot;culling&quot; function is taken advantage of when splenectomy is employed as treatment for hereditary spherocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>As part of this quality control function, the spleen also removes particles from within circulating red cells (ie, its &quot;pitting&quot; function), such as nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies), insoluble globin precipitates (Heinz bodies), and normally-occurring endocytic vacuoles. Of clinical importance, Howell-Jolly bodies <strong>appear</strong> in circulating red cells when the spleen has been surgically removed or has reduced function (ie, hyposplenism), and subsequently <strong>disappear</strong> when and if splenic function returns, as in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenosis due to the growth of splenic implants resulting from the spillage of cells from the splenic pulp during splenectomy or following trauma to the abdomen.

A spleen becomes palpable not only as a result of its size, but also its texture. Ordinarily, the spleen is a soft organ, but a spleen infiltrated with lymphoma or one with extramedullary hematopoiesis (eg, a myeloproliferative disorder) is much firmer and thus easier to feel.

There are at least six different palpation and percussion maneuvers available. Only two of these will be discussed here: abdominal palpation and percussion of Traube's semilunar space. The interested reader is referred to the literature and textbooks of physical examination techniques for further information on this subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders/abstract/55,87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,87-89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent errors made in examination of the spleen involve incomplete relaxation of the abdominal musculature of the patient and the musculature of the examiner's hand(s). Effectiveness in palpating the spleen can be maximized by remembering that the major error in splenic palpation is due to pressing too hard on the patient's abdomen, and by paying attention to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the patient supine, allow the patient to feel the examining hand on the abdomen before pressing down, and to become adjusted to its presence. Do not suddenly increase pressure during palpation, as an enlarged spleen may be quite tender (particularly if it has enlarged quickly) and the patient may be reluctant to allow the examination to continue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that the patient is relaxed, with arms at the sides of the abdomen. If the arms are raised, this may stiffen the abdominal musculature and make examination more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation of the patient can be improved if the legs and neck are slightly flexed. Relaxation of the examiner can be improved by being comfortably seated in a chair alongside the patient's bed or examining table, with the examiner on the patient's right side, the right hand doing the palpation and the left hand underneath and supporting the patient's left lower posterior rib cage.</p><p/><p>A spleen that is only minimally enlarged will be quite movable with respiration, and may be palpable only at the end of inspiration. Using a light touch, with the skin depressed under the left costal margin, a minimally enlarged spleen can be felt as a rounded edge with the consistency of normal liver, which slips under the examiner's fingers at the end of inspiration and back on expiration.</p><p>Since the spleen is normally a posterior structure, increased sensitivity can occasionally be obtained by placing the patient in the right lateral decubitus position, with knees and neck flexed. This maneuver also increases relaxation of the abdominal musculature and rotates the spleen to a more anterior position. One study suggested that this additional maneuver was not useful when it followed examination of the patient in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, it is this authors' experience that some spleens not palpable with the patient in the supine position are felt with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position.</p><p>With greater degrees of enlargement, the spleen rotates to a more anterior and rightward position, and may extend downward into the pelvis. Under these circumstances, the lower pole of the spleen may not be easily felt (since it is well below the left costal margin), and splenomegaly is appreciated either by palpating at successively lower levels on the left side of the abdomen or by palpating the medial edge of the spleen. The presence of a notch or indentation on the medial splenic edge is a further indication that the mass is spleen and not the left kidney or a pancreatic pseudocyst.</p><p>In more extreme cases, the enlarged spleen extends across the midline, and may even be palpable in the right upper quadrant. The presence of exquisite splenic tenderness suggests the presence of infarction or perisplenitis in such massively enlarged spleens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Percussion of Traube's semilunar space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tympanitic area overlying the gastric stomach bubble in the left lateral hemithorax has been called Traube's semilunar space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The size and location of this space depends upon the contents and position of the stomach. The space will be obliterated in the presence of left pleural or pericardial effusion, and will be displaced downward following enlargement of the left lobe of the liver or, more commonly, the spleen. False-positive and false-negative results may be obtained, however, in patients examined too soon after a meal and in obese subjects, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to palpate an enlarged spleen depends upon several variables, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the spleen.
