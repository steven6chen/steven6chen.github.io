Most subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) are caused by ruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. In most cases, the presence of the aneurysm is unsuspected until SAH occurs. After aneurysmal SAH, the patient is at substantial risk of rebleeding: 3 to 4 percent in the first 24 hours and 1 to 2 percent each day in the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rerupture is associated with a mortality that is estimated to be 70 percent. Aneurysm repair is the only effective treatment to prevent this occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Unruptured cerebral aneurysms may manifest clinically by their mass effect on adjacent neurologic structures, or they may be discovered incidentally when a patient has a neuroimaging study for another indication. Such aneurysms have a future risk of rupture and SAH that depends in part on their size and location.</p><p>The treatment of cerebral aneurysms is discussed in this topic. Other aspects of the clinical features, diagnosis and management of cerebral aneurysms and aneurysmal SAH are discussed separately.

Intraoperative angiography is a useful to facilitate accurate clip placement, and to confirm parent vessel patency after clip occlusion and occlusion of the aneurysm; this allows immediate clip revision when necessary, which is estimated to occur in approximately 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/2,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-9</a>].

Aneurysm size &gt;10mm and neck size &gt;4mm were risk factors for this complication. <br/><br/>While of unproven benefit, some combination of heparin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiplatelet therapy is used in most centers to minimize sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In a prospective study involving 574 hospitalized patients admitted within 14 days of SAH, rebleeding was associated with a 12-fold reduction in the probability of survival with functional independence at three months (odds ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.34) after correction for admission Hunt-Hess grade and aneurysm size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Another prospective study found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In one case series, half of hemorrhage expansions were related to rerupture of the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other mechanisms of hemorrhage expansion or rebleeding may be similar to those for intracerebral hemorrhage.

The potential benefits of early surgery (within 24 to 72 hours of the hemorrhage) include prevention of rebleeding and management of vasospasm. In addition, the usual methods of treating vasospasm (hypervolemia, induced hypertension, intraarterial vasodilators, and balloon angioplasty) are dangerous in the presence of an untreated aneurysm.

Limited clinical trial evidence suggests that early aneurysm surgery may be associated with a lower risk of rebleeding and better outcome than later surgery, but the results did not achieve statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

In the largest of the randomized trials to examine this question, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), 2143 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were randomly assigned to neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

Nonetheless, we favor early treatment, with endovascular therapy when possible for patients with poor grade SAH. </p><p>Early surgery may be more complicated than a procedure delayed for 10 to 14 days in patients with poor clinical grade.

In addition, although not substantiated by any large series, the use of intravascular embolization of aneurysms in the acute setting may facilitate aggressive medical management algorithms for proactive treatment of cerebral vasospasm.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis that included the ISAT as well as other smaller randomized trials and observational studies, found that while outcomes at one-year were more favorable in patient treated with endovascular coiling, the choice of treatment modality did not seem to have a significant impact on outcome in patients with poor preoperative grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a subsequently performed randomized trial of 571 patients with SAH that included patients with a broader spectrum of disease severity than were included in ISAT, patients assigned to endovascular treatment were more likely to have a better outcome at one year as measured by the modified Rankin Scale; the difference no longer reached statistical significant at year three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. It is noteworthy that 38 percent of those assigned to endovascular treatment crossed over to surgical clipping (usually because the endovascular treatment was judged to be technically difficult); such patients had a worse outcome than those who received the assigned endovascular treatment and was similar to those who were assigned to and received clipping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259173782\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttreatment management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are managed in the intensive care unit after aneurysm therapy.

There are no randomized trials on which to base recommendations. Decisions about therapy need to weigh the natural history of the aneurysm, the risks of intervention, and patient preferences. While these are discussed in detail separately, in general, asymptomatic aneurysms &ge;7 to 10 mm in diameter warrant strong consideration for treatment, taking into account patient age, existing medical and neurologic conditions, and relative risks for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

In many cases, anatomic considerations, such as size, location, other morphological features determine which treatment is most appropriate for the patient. (See <a href=\"#H259178066\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms present with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Patients have a high risk of rebleeding in the first days and hours after SAH, and this complication is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H259181003\" class=\"local\">'Early rebleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions regarding the timing and choice of therapy for a ruptured intracranial aneurysms are ideally made by a team of experienced clinicians who consider the neurologic grade and clinical status of the patient, the availability of expertise in surgical and endovascular techniques, as well as the anatomic characteristics of the aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H3328278\" class=\"local\">'Timing and choice of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with good grade aSAH (Hunt and Hess grades I to III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69179 \">table 1</a>), we suggest early aneurysm repair (within 24 to 72 hours) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In centers with available expertise and in patients with endovascularly-accessible lesions, short term outcomes appear to be improved with endovascular coiling as compared to surgical clipping.
