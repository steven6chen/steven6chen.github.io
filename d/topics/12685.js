The prognosis of fully treated early breast cancer is usually very good, in part due to systemic therapies reducing the risk of recurrence. For example, in the United States, estimates are that over 89 percent of patients will survive five years or more following their initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, the long-term toxicities of breast cancer therapies need to be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systemic therapies used to treat early breast cancer can be associated with loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> are potent inhibitors of osteoclast activity. They are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for managing osteoporosis and bone metastases from a variety of malignancies, aid in preventing therapy-related bone loss, and complement nutritional (calcium and vitamin D), exercise, and healthy lifestyle behaviors. </p><p>This topic will review the use of bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> for preservation of BMD in the adjuvant breast cancer setting. Adjuvant anticancer treatment modalities of breast cancer, methods to assess risk of fracture (eg, using history, physical exam, algorithms such as the fracture risk assessment tool [FRAX]), imaging BMD, optimal intake of calcium and vitamin D, and the utility of osteoclast inhibitors in the management of breast cancer bone metastases are reviewed elsewhere.

In general the estrogen-like, estrogen-progesterone, and parathyroid hormone therapies are to be avoided due to the potential to have negative impacts on cancer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The novel sclerostin-targeting therapies have not yet been studied in patients with a history of breast cancer and there is theoretical concern regarding the use of this class of drug in patients who may have occult bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAST CANCER THERAPY-ASSOCIATED BONE LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a history of breast cancer may be at increased risk of osteoporosis secondary to the systemic therapies administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Osteoporosis is associated with an increased risk of fracture and can be associated with significant morbidity, mortality, disfigurement and loss of self-esteem, and health care expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Estrogen, an important target for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer therapies, is also an important hormone for bone homeostasis.

This includes obtaining a detailed history, physical exam, and medication review. If there is a significant risk for osteoporosis, then obtain a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to aid in assessing the individual's risk for fracture. The evaluation and treatment of women at risk for premenopausal osteoporosis is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Premenopausal women with treatment-related bone loss'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical risk factor assessment'</a>.) </p><p>Although less than a third of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases occur in premenopausal women, the risk of long-term bone-related toxicity as a consequence of cancer-related therapy is of unique concern, primarily because of their anticipated long life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Breast cancer therapy-induced bone loss in premenopausal women may occur due to ovarian dysfunction secondary to chemotherapy, or endocrine treatment (ie, gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] analogs) or oophorectomy. The risk of ovarian dysfunction and associated bone loss is impacted by the patient's age at time of therapy and the chemotherapy regimen used. Note that the risk of accelerated bone loss with ovarian dysfunction may not be permanent; some women with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea will experience resumption of menses during follow-up, which may allow bone mass to improve with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, the cumulative loss of bone mass due to cancer therapy-induced menopause, which occurs acutely, versus bone loss in natural menopause, which proceeds over years, has not been formally studied. In addition, the fracture risk attributable to these changes in BMD has not been quantified. Finally, it is unclear whether either mode of menopause ultimately has a greater impact on fracture.</p><p>As described in the following section, clinical trials have confirmed that the bisphosphonates have the ability to either slow the rate of bone loss, or increase BMD in premenopausal women with breast cancer.

Chemotherapy and its associated supportive therapies may have a negative effect on bone mass, although the direct effects of chemotherapy on the bone mass of this population are not well established. Preliminary data suggest that women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy but not endocrine therapy may lose 1 to 10 percent of their bone mass within one year of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The effect of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women is more thoroughly studied than that of premenopausal women, perhaps due to the greater risk of osteoporosis in an older patient population. Adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> can promote stabilization to mild increase in bone mass in postmenopausal women, most likely secondary to the end-organ specificity of this selective estrogen receptor modulator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. In contrast to adjuvant tamoxifen, adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) use promotes the risk for loss of BMD and increases risk of osteoporotic fractures. The evaluation and management of AI-induced bone loss are reviewed separately.

The optimal level of fracture risk or time to intervene with a pharmacologic, bone-directed intervention has not been defined. In general, pharmacologic interventions are used only after conservative measures have been implemented and there is a significant risk for fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

We discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant bisphosphonates with all postmenopausal women who have a risk of distant recurrence of 10 percent or more, or who have low bone mass. The bisphosphonate regimen used may be the same dose and schedule for treating osteoporosis. </p><p>The use of adjuvant bisphosphonates (either adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> 4 mg IV every six months or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clodronate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clodronate</a> 1600 mg daily) is challenging because neither of these regimens is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjuvant cancer therapy. Some have advocated for the use of osteoporosis dosing of adjuvant bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with a 10 percent or greater risk of distant recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, there are no prospective data testing these regimens for cancer outcomes. Our enthusiasm for these regimens is tempered by the lack of prospective hypothesis testing for subsets of women and the absence of a clearly defined mechanism for the selective effects in postmenopausal women. Having acknowledged these factors, we discuss adjuvant bisphosphonates with postmenopausal women with significant risk of breast cancer recurrence who are receiving systemic adjuvant therapy.</p><p>Our discussion on the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates is above and beyond the discussion of bone health. If there are clinical indications for a bone-modifying agent to address BMD or fracture risk, then a regimen to treat osteoporosis is usually favored.
