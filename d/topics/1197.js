Depending on the activity, this weight-bearing joint can support two to five times a person's body weight. Chronic knee pain affects 25 percent of adults and has a deleterious effect on daily function and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The general evaluation of the adult presenting with undifferentiated knee pain is discussed here, including details about differentiating among the causes of knee pain based upon the history and examination findings. For cases where knee pain develops following acute, low-energy trauma or chronic overuse, often in athletes or active adults, and is most likely musculoskeletal in origin, a separate in-depth discussion of how to approach such patients is provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183940894\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC KNEE ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy and basic biomechanics of the knee are reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H6196308\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>First, the differential diagnosis for knee pain is complex and obtaining a clear history remains essential for diagnosis. The following flow chart provides an overview of how to approach the diagnosis of knee pain in the adult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111806\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111806 \">algorithm 1</a>). Information from the history helps the clinician to distinguish among four diagnostic categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute knee pain following recent trauma or overuse </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atraumatic knee pain associated with joint effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atraumatic knee pain NOT associated with joint effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referred knee pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncommon causes of knee pain</p><p/><p>Several questions in particular are important for narrowing the differential diagnosis and should be asked of every adult patient presenting with knee pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did pain begin following an acute traumatic event? Pain immediately following an injury is concerning for possible structural damage to the knee. Delayed pain suggests tendon strains, cartilage contusions, or minor soft tissue tears. The closer the pain onset is to the specific event, the higher the likelihood of significant structural damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain associated with activity (eg, new exercise regimen, change in previous training habits, day-to-day activity over the preceding few months)? Pain associated with activity should lead to further inquiry about training equipment (eg, shoes, braces), training volume (eg, training days per week, duration of training sessions), intensity, and any recent changes in such parameters. Information about specific activities that trigger pain can be helpful. As an example, anterior knee pain associated with sprinting or jumping is a classic part of the history of patellar tendinopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In which anatomic quadrant is the pain located (anterior, posterior, lateral, or medial), or is the pain diffuse or vague? Localizing knee pain to an anatomic quadrant or more specific location helps circumscribe the differential diagnosis. Pinpoint localization is generally possible following trauma to a specific ligament, tendon, or other palpable anatomic structure. Pain described as diffuse or vague may be secondary to injury of an intra-articular structure, a rheumatologic or infectious process, or from referred pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the painful knee been swollen (ie, joint effusion) or erythematous? Rapid swelling after trauma occurs with bleeding into the knee joint and suggests a significant injury (eg, anterior cruciate ligament tear). Swelling or erythema occurring without trauma may indicate an infectious, rheumatologic, or crystal-induced condition and diagnostic arthrocentesis is often indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are constitutional symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue, or rash, present? The presence of such symptoms and signs suggests a systemic illness and further investigation of infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic causes is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of prior knee injury or surgery? A past history of knee injury is the most accurate predictive risk factor for future knee injury. The clinician should inquire about the type of injury, duration of disability, and the rehabilitation program. Often, a new knee injury is a complication of an old or concurrent injury. As an example, patellofemoral pain can develop in patients who alter their running gait due to discomfort from chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Likewise, prior surgical repairs can &quot;wear out&quot; or fail, leading to recurrence of the initial condition. All patients with prior injury or surgery experience some degree of deconditioning while injured and recovering. This deconditioning, combined with poor or incomplete rehabilitation, predisposes to new injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there symptoms affecting any other joints? Subjective symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> examination findings that reveal multiple affected joints raise suspicion for a systemic or rheumatologic process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of systemic or rheumatologic disease? A known history of a systemic or rheumatologic disease can help to guide clinical inquiry, physical examination, and possible laboratory testing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3679603270\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE KNEE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An in-depth discussion of the physical examination of the knee is provided separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a>). A few points about the knee examination are worth highlighting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When examining the knee, look closely for discrepancies in strength and range of motion between the painful and asymptomatic joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to reproduce the patient's presenting pain complaint. Many examination maneuvers cause some discomfort, even when performed on asymptomatic limbs. Therefore, it is important to use only the most appropriate maneuvers (based on the most likely potential diagnoses as determined by the history) to reproduce the patient&rsquo;s symptoms as precisely as possible. This approach is most likely to pinpoint the cause of the discomfort. Pain elicited by the examination that is different than the presenting complaint may be worth noting, but it is often unrelated to the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform the knee examination systematically. By performing the examination in the same manner every time, the risk of overlooking an important finding is reduced. Traditionally the musculoskeletal examination is performed in the following order: inspection, palpation, range of motion, strength, neurovascular, and &quot;special tests&quot; (maneuvers to assess a specific diagnosis).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265356580\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL STEPS TO CATEGORIZING KNEE PAIN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3876243761\"><span class=\"h2\">Step one: Distinguish acute versus chronic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most musculoskeletal conditions, pain of less than six weeks duration is classified as acute or subacute, while pain lasting longer than six weeks is classified as chronic. This is by convention, as there is no high-quality evidence supporting this threshold. However, most minor musculoskeletal ailments resolve within six weeks of onset with appropriate activity modification. The following flow chart provides an overview of how to approach the diagnosis of knee pain in the adult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111806\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111806 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Acute knee pain may stem directly from trauma (easily identified by the history in most cases) or from regular activity (eg, overuse injury), or it may be unrelated to trauma or activity. It is important to determine whether the onset of pain was abrupt or insidious. As an example, it is helpful to know that a patient's pain started abruptly eight weeks ago while running and has not fully abated. While technically a chronic pain presentation (greater than six weeks duration), this presentation is consistent with a specific event that caused the acute onset of pain. In cases involving an abrupt onset or sudden change in knee pain, the clinician should focus on clarifying the events leading up to the onset.</p><p>Some patients complain of a sudden worsening or change in a long-standing pain (ie, acute on chronic pain pattern). This suggests an overuse injury that has been exacerbated by activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498457121\"><span class=\"h2\">Step two: Distinguish traumatic versus non-traumatic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step is to determine whether an acute injury has occurred. Generally, this is obvious from the history. Common examples include a fall, a direct blow to the knee, or a motor vehicle crash. However, direct contact is not necessary for a person to sustain an acute traumatic knee injury. Adults may experience acute pain after non-contact trauma, such as running, jumping, squatting, slipping on ice without falling, or abruptly twisting their knee. Thus, clinicians should inquire about both contact and non-contact trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2230565343\"><span class=\"h2\">Step three: Determine whether an effusion is present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the presence or absence of a joint effusion is an important part of assessing the patient with knee pain. The method for detecting an effusion is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133526467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Detection of an effusion'</a>.)</p><p>An important adjunct to the physical examination for detecting an effusion is the use of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US). Moderate to large volume effusions (20 mL or more) are readily detected by manual examination; however, small effusions can be missed. MSK US is nearly 100 percent sensitive and specific for detecting knee effusions. This becomes important with small effusions (5 to 10 mL), which are clinically significant but can be difficult to detect by physical examination alone (especially in obese or muscular patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of a knee joint effusion following acute trauma suggests the presence of structural damage to bone, cartilage, or a ligament. Non-traumatic knee effusions unrelated to activity, warrant a more thorough workup, as the differential diagnosis includes an infected (ie, septic) joint. (See <a href=\"#H346688989\" class=\"local\">'Conditions NOT related to activity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195399681\"><span class=\"h2\">Step four: Determine pain location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the primary location of knee pain is useful in all cases, but it is particularly important when evaluating patients with non-traumatic knee pain and no joint effusion. The location of the knee pain (anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior) helps to inform the differential diagnosis. Ask the patient to point with one finger to the precise location of the pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552741321\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE KNEE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach to the patient with knee pain following acute trauma is reviewed in detail separately. Clinicians evaluating patients with such a presentation, regardless of the patient&rsquo;s baseline activities or whether the trauma involved physical exertion, are referred to that discussion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H6196446\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'Acute knee pain associated with trauma'</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis for acute knee pain following trauma associated with an effusion includes the injuries listed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90950\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90950 \">table 1</a>). Note that trauma for the purposes of this discussion refers primarily to low-energy trauma (as opposed to high-energy trauma, such as a motor vehicle crash). Patients with knee pain following high-energy trauma may have significant internal injuries and should be evaluated in the emergency department. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Common causes of knee pain following acute, low-energy trauma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial or lateral collateral ligament tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior cruciate ligament tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meniscus tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patella dislocation or significant subluxation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patella tendon tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-articular fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteochondral defect</p><p/><p>Less common causes of knee pain following acute, low-energy trauma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone contusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterolateral corner injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior cruciate ligament tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quadriceps tendon tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibular head or neck fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patella fracture </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1748999242\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS NOT INVOLVING ACUTE TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying the cause of non-traumatic knee pain can be challenging. Determining whether the knee pain is associated with activity, and whether an effusion is present, are important early steps in narrowing the differential diagnosis. A table summarizing the major diagnoses to consider and their distinguishing features is provided<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111548 \">table 2</a>). The following flow chart provides an overview of how to approach the diagnosis of knee pain in the adult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111806\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111806 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382908534\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-traumatic conditions associated WITH a joint effusion</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4237572199\"><span class=\"h3\">Conditions made worse by activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of non-traumatic knee pain associated with an effusion can be narrowed based on the association with activity. Important, common causes of non-traumatic knee pain that increase acutely with activity include osteochondral defects and osteoarthritis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Articular cartilage (osteochondral) injury or defect</strong> &ndash; Osteochondral defects are usually caused by significant knee trauma but may be secondary to milder trauma or chronic overuse (eg, osteochondritis dissecans). Patients with such defects often describe diffuse knee pain that is worse during and after activity. A knee effusion brought on by activity is an important historical clue, as spontaneous effusions unrelated to activity generally do <strong>not</strong> occur with osteochondral defects. Imaging studies (often magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or arthroscopy are required to diagnose osteochondritis dissecans and other osteochondral defects. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> &ndash; Osteoarthritis (OA) involves degradation and thinning of the articular cartilage, and OA of the knee is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. OA can present as diffuse or localized knee pain, with or without an effusion. Intermittent effusions occur in persons with OA when they increase their activity. Patients with an OA flare often describe a delayed onset to their effusion, which develops 12 to 24 hours following the acute event. Vague or diffuse joint line tenderness, intact ligaments, and non-focal meniscus tests comprise the typical constellation of examination findings associated with OA flares. In addition, many patients are unable to fully flex or extend the affected knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Strongly associated risk factors can help to identify patients in whom knee OA is the most likely diagnosis, these include: age over 50 years, female gender, higher body mass index, previous knee injury or knee surgery, malalignment, joint laxity, occupational or recreational activities that place stress on the knee, family history, and the presence of Heberden's nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105816 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is often poor correlation between radiographic changes and a person's symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therefore, the diagnosis of knee OA remains a clinical one and radiographs should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosing OA. The diagnosis of knee OA can be made without the use of radiographs or in patients with normal radiographic findings, if each the following are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age at least 40 years old</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Activity-related joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minimal or no morning stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Functional limitations, such a declining ability to walk distances or to climb stairs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One or more typical examination findings (eg, crepitus, restricted joint movement, bony enlargement)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a palpable effusion is present, joint aspiration and synovial fluid testing may be needed to exclude inflammatory disease. The indications for synovial fluid testing are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346688989\"><span class=\"h3\">Conditions NOT related to activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knee pain associated with a joint effusion, despite the absence of any trauma or activity that exacerbates symptoms, is a concerning finding, and indicates the need for a more extensive workup. In addition to a careful history and examination, plain radiographs and knee joint aspiration are often necessary. Important causes of non-traumatic knee pain that is not associated with activity include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crystal arthropathy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious (septic) arthritis (<strong>medical emergency</strong>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated gonococcal infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic rheumatic disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Crystal arthropathy &ndash; </strong>Crystal arthropathy can present as unilateral arthritis, which may include acute knee pain and effusion not related to trauma or activity. Local erythema, warmth, joint pain, and an effusion are common examination findings. Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease (ie, pseudogout) most often affects the knee, while gouty arthritis most often involves in the first metatarsophalangeal joint or midfoot, although knee involvement is common. A serum uric acid level should not be used to diagnose an acute gouty flare, as up to a third of such patients have a normal serum uric acid concentration. While a serum white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein may be useful for the management of these patients, they should never substitute for joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infectious (septic) arthritis</strong> &ndash; Similar to crystal arthropathy, infectious arthritis of the knee typically presents with local erythema, warmth, joint pain, and an effusion. However, distinguishing between the two is crucial. Even among patients with risk factors and clinical findings consistent with crystal arthropathy or other non-infectious causes of knee pain, infectious arthritis must be ruled out if it is among the diagnoses entertained. Bacterial joint infection (ie, septic arthritis) is a medical emergency, as extensive cartilage damage can occur within hours of infection onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Definitive diagnosis is made by joint aspiration and fluid analysis. Joint fluid is evaluated for color and consistency, and sent to the lab for cell counts with differential, gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis. Synovial fluid analysis for glucose, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has limited utility. Elevations of synovial WBC counts above 100,000 per high-powered field (HPF), with polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) comprising more than 90 percent (ie, left shift), is most predictive of bacterial joint infection, though infection may be present with lower WBC counts. Additional testing may be warranted based on clinical suspicion and patient risk factors. Synovial fluid analysis and the septic joint are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI)</strong> &ndash; DGI can develop in up to 3 percent of patients infected with <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. Most such patients are younger than 40 years, but the condition occurs in both men and women. Presenting features of DGI include either a triad of abrupt onset of polyarthralgia (non-symmetric), tenosynovitis (particularly the wrist, fingers, ankles and toes), and painless dermatitis, or an asymmetric polyarticular or monoarticular purulent arthritis without skin manifestations, in which case the knee is the most common site. <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> is one of many organisms that can cause knee pain due to infection and inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-gonococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated gonococcal infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic rheumatic disease</strong><em> &ndash;</em> Systemic rheumatic disease is a group of systemic autoimmune diseases that include: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. RA is the most prevalent disease in this group. The presence of systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue, or unintentional weight loss suggests infection, systemic disease, or cancer. Therefore, in these patients a more general history and a thorough physical examination should be performed looking for causes other than primarily musculoskeletal ones. Additional lab testing and diagnostic imaging may be necessary.

In these patients, the first step is to determine if the pain is exacerbated by activity. Some of the conditions listed below may cause some localized swelling, or an intermittent effusion, but nearly always this occurs with activity. It is important to ask patients that do not participate in regular physical exercise or labor if something in their day-to-day activity has changed (new job, recent vacation, recent work around the house, etc). The second and more important step is to pinpoint the location of the pain, if possible.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for knee pain unrelated to acute trauma or joint effusion is extensive, and therefore, the history and physical examination should be used to categorize the pain anatomically and narrow the list of potential diagnoses. A table summarizing the major diagnoses and their distinguishing features, and organized by pain location, is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111562 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In summary, the key questions when evaluating these patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is this an acute or chronic problem (six weeks is the standard threshold for chronic knee pain)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has your activity level changed significantly in the three months leading up to the onset of pain?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a single finger, can you point to the area where the pain is focused?</p><p/><p>For the conditions listed below, joint aspiration and serum laboratory studies are rarely indicated, and radiographs are often unnecessary for making the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1298028241\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior knee pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain at the anterior knee is the most common complaint among patients presenting with atraumatic knee pain without an effusion. Such pain often stems from a specific structure and therefore the patient can either &quot;point with one finger&quot; to the painful site, or the clinician can recreate the pain with focused palpation. The conditions causing such pain include Osgood-Schlatter disease, Hoffa's fat pad syndrome, patellar and quadriceps tendinopathy (tendinosis), bursitis, and plica syndrome. Important structures to palpate in patients with anterior pain include the patella, patellofemoral joint, patellar tendon, tibial tubercle, and quadriceps tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89739\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89739 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osgood-Schlatter disease</strong> &ndash; Pain from Osgood-Schlatter disease is caused by tibial tubercle apophysitis at the insertion of the patellar tendon. The condition is most common in active older children and adolescents, but some adults may experience ongoing pain after the apophysis has fused. Pain and tenderness are localized to the tibial tubercle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54565\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54565 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51102 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50421 \">picture 3</a>). Pain increases with activity, particularly jumping and running. Poor flexibility of the quadriceps, and possibly the hip flexors, may be noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hoffa's fat pad syndrome</strong> &ndash; The infrapatellar (ie, Hoffa's) fat pad (IFP) is a highly innervated and vascularized extra-articular structure located distal to the patella and directly beneath the patellar tendon. Edema within the fat pad can be painful and has been implicated in patellofemoral maltracking; patients with a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain (PFP) should be evaluated for possible IFP involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. IFP-related pain generally presents as anterior knee pain distal to the patella. It is often made worse by sprinting activities or squatting, and shares historical characteristics with patellar tendinopathy and PFP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While no special tests are available to diagnose IFP, the physical examination may help to distinguish it from alternative diagnoses. Knee inspection is usually unremarkable, but inflammation of the IFP may be noted as asymmetric swelling of the patellar tendon. IFP syndrome should not cause visible maltracking of the patella during knee flexion or extension. Maneuvers that impinge the IFP, such as squatting or direct downward pressure on the patellar tendon, reproduce the patient&rsquo;s anterior knee pain. Tenderness with palpation deep to the patellar tendon on either side, but not at its insertion, suggests inflammation and edema of the IFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Musculoskeletal ultrasound can be used to demonstrate that the patellar tendon, bursa, and other adjacent structures appear normal, and may reveal signs suggestive of IFP pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quadriceps and patellar tendinopathy</strong> &ndash; The distal quadriceps tendon is a conjoined tendon of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris muscles. As it proceeds distally, the quadriceps tendon envelops the patella and becomes the patellar tendon distally, inserting on the anterior tibial tubercle. Both the quadriceps and patellar tendon are susceptible to many of the same conditions and injuries. Explosive movements involving knee extension, such as jumping, running, or squatting (eccentric stress) reproduce the pain associated with both quadriceps and patellar tendinopathy. Quadriceps tendinopathy, the more common condition, characteristically causes pain proximal to the superior patellar pole. Physical examination findings include focal pain with resisted knee extension and often some atrophy of the quadriceps muscle (typically the vastus medialis) on the involved side in comparison with the unaffected leg. Focal tenderness with direct palpation at, or just proximal to, the superior patellar pole is characteristic. In contrast, patellar tendinopathy causes pain distal to the patella. Focal tenderness at or just distal to the inferior patellar pole is common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quadriceps-muscle-and-tendon-injuries#H528366661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quadriceps muscle and tendon injuries&quot;, section on 'Quadriceps and patellar tendinopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The quadriceps and patellar tendons are visualized readily with ultrasound, which can be used as an adjunct to the physical examination for diagnosing tendinopathy. Tendinopathic changes visualized on ultrasound may include loss of the normal fibrillar structure of the tendon with reduced echogenicity, tendon thickening, and possibly calcific tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bursitis</strong> &ndash; Acute prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis presents with localized redness, swelling, and marked tenderness anterior to the patella or patellar tendon. The condition is usually associated with a history of direct trauma or repetitive pressure (prolonged kneeling) at the patellar region but may also be crystal-induced or due to a bacterial infection. Examination reveals pre-patellar swelling and edema between the skin and the patella. Ultrasound examination can be used to assess the anatomic relations of the above structures, and the exact location of bursitis. Care should be taken to not compress the superficial structures when performing the examination. The motion and stability of the knee joint itself remain unaffected by bursitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-bursitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee bursitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plica syndrome</strong> &ndash; Individuals who have sustained trauma to the medial peripatellar area or dislocations or subluxations of the patella may develop thickening of the medial patellar plica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This condition can also develop chronically from overuse, particularly in runners with some degree of genu valgus (&quot;knock knees&quot;). A thickened medial plica may catch at the medial edge of the patella or the medial femoral condyle causing localized anteromedial knee pain that increases with movement, and possibly chondral injury. Examination reveals thickening of the plica (palpable in most patients) with focal tenderness at the medial underside of the patella. Ultrasound can be used to visualize thickened plica tissue. A useful examination maneuver is the medial patellar plica test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83265 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plica-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plica syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The causes of anterior knee pain listed above are often readily diagnosed by history and examination. The causes listed below&mdash;patella subluxation, PFP, chondromalacia patella, and patellar stress fracture&mdash;present without acute trauma or joint effusion, and do not lend themselves to pinpoint localization.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic patella dislocation or subluxation</strong> &ndash; Patients with a history of patellar dislocation have damaged the medial patellofemoral ligament and thus are at increased risk for recurrent or chronic subluxation and dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89127\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89127 \">figure 4</a>). These patients typically describe anteromedial patellar discomfort and a sensation of the knee snapping or giving way during activity. Examination often reveals atrophy of the vastus medialis and a positive apprehension test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54035\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54035 \">figure 5</a>). Individuals with hypermobility disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, are at risk for chronic patella subluxation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and initial management of patellar dislocations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patellofemoral pain (PFP) </strong>&ndash; PFP is a frequently encountered overuse disorder that involves the patellofemoral region and often presents as anterior knee pain. PFP is diagnosed primarily from the history and is characterized by pain around or behind the patella that cannot be attributed to another discrete intra-articular (eg, meniscus tear) or peripatellar (eg, patellar tendinopathy) pathology. PFP is aggravated by one or more activities that involve loading the patellofemoral joint during weight bearing on a flexed knee. Common historical features include vague, poorly localized anterior knee pain (usually &quot;under&quot; or around the patella) that is made worse with squatting, running, prolonged sitting (theater sign), or going up or down stairs. Mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, catching) and the presence of an effusion are NOT associated with PFP. Many people with PFP report instability or their knee &quot;giving out&quot;, which stems from pain causing reflex inhibition of the quadriceps. It bears emphasis that patellar instability and ligamentous injury of the knee should be ruled out by examination before ascribing the patients symptoms to PFP. Ultrasound can be used to assess peripatellar structures of the knee and to help rule out other diagnoses. However, there are no ultrasound-specific changes or criteria for diagnosing PFP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patellofemoral-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patellofemoral pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chondromalacia patella</strong> &ndash; Chondromalacia patella is a cause of peripatellar pain and the term is commonly used interchangeably with PFP. However, chondromalacia patella is a distinct radiologic diagnosis defined by the presence of pathologic changes in the articular cartilage on the underside of the patella, such as softening, erosion, and fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The clinical history and examination findings are similar to PFP, but an effusion may also be present if articular cartilage damage is sufficiently severe. The articular damage is usually secondary to a prior injury or chronic maltracking of the patella in the trochlear groove. MRI is needed to make the diagnosis but is usually unnecessary as treatment is similar to that for PFP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patella stress fracture</strong> &ndash; Patella stress fractures develop after repeated application of submaximal stress leading to cortical disruption and pain. These fractures are seen in highly active individuals participating in explosive jumping or plyometric activities, and does not occur in sedentary individuals or &quot;weekend warriors.&quot; Often, there is an abrupt increase in the volume or intensity of exercise or athletic training several weeks prior to the onset of pain. Although rare, patella stress fractures are considered to be at high risk for nonunion and should be referred to a provider with expertise in musculoskeletal medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The history and examination findings are often nonspecific in the early stages, but pain becomes more localized to the patella as the injury progresses. Ultrasound can be used to evaluate for acute patellar fracture or bipartite patella; however, it is not sensitive or specific for stress fracture. MRI is typically needed to make a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-knee-pain-or-injury-in-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents#H2373994488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic knee pain or injury in children or skeletally immature adolescents&quot;, section on 'Patellar stress fracture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3071139664\"><span class=\"h3\">Medial knee pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medial knee pain unrelated to trauma or a joint effusion may be due to a degenerative tear of the medial meniscus or to other conditions. Important structures to palpate include the medial joint line, medial (tibial) collateral ligament, and pes anserine bursa.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Degenerative medial meniscal tear</strong> &ndash; Degenerative medial meniscal tears are common in older patients, as the medial compartment of the knee absorbs the most force during walking, running, and squatting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89730\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89730 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611 \">figure 7</a>). Although a common finding on MRI, degenerative meniscal tears (both medial and lateral), are often asymptomatic. Findings that suggest a meniscal tear is the source of pain include medial or diffuse knee pain, mechanical symptoms (catching, locking, inability to extend the knee completely), swelling (especially after activity), and increased pain with squatting. Examination findings consistent with a meniscal tear include medial joint line tenderness (especially posterior to the medial collateral ligament), positive McMurray test, and a positive Thessaly test. It is important to ask whether the pain elicited during a provocative maneuver of the knee (eg, McMurray test) is the same as the pain that the patient has been experiencing and caused them to seek medical attention. A thorough history and examination are typically sufficient to make the diagnosis, and advanced imaging is generally unnecessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Saphenous nerve entrapment</strong> &ndash; The saphenous nerve is the largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59888 \">figure 8</a>). It traverses the adductor canal and its infrapatellar branch innervates the skin over the medial and anterior portion of the knee. Entrapment at the adductor canal, or anywhere along the nerve&rsquo;s path thereafter, can cause medial knee pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Such pain is characterized by allodynia (pain provoked by a typically benign stimulus) and radiation along the course of the saphenous nerve, and is worsened by palpation or tapping at the site of entrapment (Tinel's maneuver). Pain is generally NOT related to activity and the person may complain of positional pain. Consider this diagnosis in patients with chronic medial knee pain that is not consistently associated with activity, refractory to treatment, and associated with unremarkable imaging studies. A skilled sonographer can perform an ultrasound examination of the saphenous nerve. The pathologic nerve may be thickened <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surrounded by fluid. A saphenous nerve block can relieve symptoms and confirm the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pes anserine bursitis</strong> &ndash; The pes anserine tendons and underlying bursa are readily identified, and should be palpated in patients presenting with anterior or medial knee pain. The pes anserine is located on the proximal anteromedial aspect of the tibia and is the common tendinous insertion of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosis muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89741\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89741 \">picture 4</a>). Pain from pes anserine bursitis is usually of insidious onset and located on the medial side of the knee. It is worse with exercise (especially running) or ascending stairs. Pes anserine bursitis is common in older patients with osteoarthritis and less common among younger individuals. Examination may reveal tenderness over the medial joint line, similar to a medial meniscal injury, for which it is commonly mistaken. However, the point of maximum tenderness in patients with pes anserine bursitis is at or near the insertion of the pes anserine tendon on the tibia, which is anterior and distal to the medial joint line. While there may be focal swelling of the bursa at the tendon insertion point, knee swelling or effusion is NOT caused by pes anserine bursitis. Although the pes anserine bursa is readily seen on ultrasound, such evaluation is generally not needed for diagnosis or treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-bursitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee bursitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1316989576\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral knee pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral knee pain unrelated to trauma or a joint effusion may be due to iliotibial band syndrome, a degenerative tear of the lateral meniscus, or to other conditions. Important structures to palpate include the lateral joint line, lateral femoral condyle, and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) </strong>&ndash; Chronic atraumatic lateral knee pain is often caused by ITBS. The ITB is a fibrous band that runs longitudinally along the lateral aspect of the thigh from its origin at the iliac crest to its insertion on the proximal tibia (at Gerdy&rsquo;s tubercle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70825 \">figure 9</a>). An aching or burning pain and focal tenderness at the site where the band courses over the lateral femoral condyle (pain is not at the insertion on the tibia or at the lateral joint line) characterizes ITBS, which occurs predominately in runners, but may develop in cyclists due to overuse or improper seat height. The history may include downhill running or walking, or running the same direction on cambered roads (most roads have a slight slant to them eliciting a functional leg length discrepancy if one runs the same direction on the same road consistently), all of which aggravate the ITB. A suggestive history, focal tenderness at the lateral femoral condyle, and a positive Noble compression test suggest the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliotibial-band-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliotibial band syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrasound examination can be helpful for diagnosing ITBS. Tendinopathic changes, including loss of the normal fibrillar structure of the tendon, along with reduced echogenicity and tendon thickening, can be seen. Furthermore, dynamic assessment of the ITB during knee flexion and extension may reveal &quot;snapping or friction&quot; of the tendon over the lateral femoral condyle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Degenerative lateral meniscal tear</strong> &ndash; Degenerative lateral meniscal tears are less common than medial meniscal tears, but the clinical presentation and examination findings are similar. Examination should include palpation of the ITB over the lateral femoral condyle and Noble&rsquo;s compression test to rule out ITBS. (See <a href=\"#H3071139664\" class=\"local\">'Medial knee pain'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3444404623\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior knee pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior knee pain unrelated to trauma or a joint effusion may be due to popliteal artery aneurysm or entrapment, popliteal (Baker's) cyst, or tendinopathy (tendinosis). The important area to palpate is the popliteal fossa (both for a mass and a pulse).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Popliteal artery aneurysm</strong> &ndash; Generally seen in older individuals with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, smoking), popliteal artery aneurysms may present with chronic or acute posterior knee pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83190 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90998 \">figure 10</a>). Small aneurysms may be asymptomatic, but symptomatic aneurysms can present with signs of claudication or acute limb-threatening ischemia from arterial thrombosis. A large pulsatile mass noted in the popliteal fossa is consistent with this diagnosis. Ultrasound can be used to look for an aneurysm in the popliteal fossa. Comparison to the contralateral side is easily done. If this diagnosis is possible, patients should be referred for appropriate advanced diagnostic imaging. A substantial percentage of patients with a popliteal artery aneurysm have an abdominal aortic aneurysm and screening is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Popliteal artery entrapment</strong> &ndash; Unlike popliteal artery aneurysm, popliteal artery entrapment is a rare cause of posterior knee pain typically seen in athletic individuals (men more often than women) that is NOT suggestive of underlying cardiovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83190 \">picture 5</a>). Patients typically complain of a deep pain in the calf or popliteal fossa, and claudication type symptoms during vigorous activities involving repeated ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients are typically asymptomatic at rest with a normal resting physical examination. Awareness of this entity and a high index of suspicion are important because tailored imaging studies are required to make the diagnosis.

The swelling is localized to the posterior capsule and is not a true joint effusion; however, it is typically joint fluid that is contained in the cyst. Swelling usually worsens after exercise, especially activities involving repetitive knee flexion or squatting. Some patients have cyst formation without knee pain. Examination commonly reveals a palpable, non-pulsatile cystic structure in the popliteal fossa during knee extension that disappears with knee flexion. Ultrasound examination reveals a fluid-filled mass at the intersection of the medial gastrocnemius and semimembranosus tendons.

However, popliteal tendinopathy (or tendinosis) can develop chronically, most often in people who do a lot of downhill running or walking. Pain is described as a deep ache or sharp pain exacerbated by performing downhill activities. Typically, pain can be elicited by palpating the popliteal tendon origin just anterior to the lateral femoral condyle and LCL. This is done more easily if the patient crosses their legs in a &quot;figure-of-four&quot; position. The primary function of the popliteus is tibial internal rotation; therefore, symptomatic patients experience pain with resisted internal rotation (Garrick's test) or passive external rotation of the tibia.

Patients complain of localized low-level pain, with possible swelling, in the area of the tumor. A joint effusion may be present if the tumor is intra-articular. Systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss, may be present but are not universal findings. Pain that is worse at night is a concerning finding that should prompt an in-depth workup. Plain radiographs are helpful to look for bony tumors.

The suspected clinical diagnoses determine the need for imaging and appropriate study selection. Following acute trauma, imaging typically begins with plain radiographs. In patients with non-traumatic knee pain associated with an effusion, poor response to a treatment plan, or when the diagnosis is unclear, advanced diagnostic imaging may be useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H1700819050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging technique for diagnosis of soft tissue knee injuries (eg, ligament, meniscus). However, for most causes of knee pain, an MRI is unnecessary to make the correct diagnosis. Radiologic assessment of patients with acute knee pain is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-acutely-painful-knee-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the acutely painful knee in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound has gained popularity for evaluating musculoskeletal conditions, and it offers many advantages in diagnosing certain knee conditions. Ultrasound permits detailed, real-time, evaluation of the soft tissues, collateral ligaments, and tendons surrounding the knee, and is more sensitive and specific for detecting a knee effusion compared with manual techniques. In addition, ultrasound enables the clinician to perform dynamic evaluation of the knee (ie, visualizing knee structures while the knee joint is manipulated), and to compare findings with the contralateral knee.

The following flow chart provides an overview of how to approach the diagnosis of knee pain in the adult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F111806\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111806 \">algorithm 1</a>). Important elements of the history include whether trauma contributed to the development of knee pain and whether pain increases with activity, and if so what sort of activity. Information from the history helps the clinician to distinguish among four diagnostic categories:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute knee pain following recent trauma or overuse </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atraumatic knee pain associated with joint effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atraumatic knee pain NOT associated with joint effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Referred knee pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uncommon causes of knee pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Key questions to ask the adult presenting with undifferentiated knee pain are reviewed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H3787364551\" class=\"local\">'History overview and diagnostic categories'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination of any joint is classically divided into inspection, palpation, range of motion testing, strength and neurovascular testing, and special maneuvers to assess for specific diagnoses. Special tests are selected based upon the most likely diagnostic category, which is based in turn upon the history. Detection of a knee joint effusion is an important part of the examination. The knee examination is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3679603270\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination of the knee'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key steps for determining the underlying cause of knee pain in the adult include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distinguish between acute and chronic pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distinguish between traumatic and non-traumatic pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Determine whether a joint effusion is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Determine the location of the pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Each step is discussed in the text. Once a history and examination are performed, and the steps outlined here are completed, the clinician will have narrowed the differential diagnosis to a small number of potential conditions. (See <a href=\"#H265356580\" class=\"local\">'Initial steps to categorizing knee pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common causes of knee pain following acute, low-energy trauma include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medial or lateral collateral ligament tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anterior cruciate ligament tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Meniscus tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patella dislocation or significant subluxation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patella tendon tear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intra-articular fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Osteochondral defect </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Important distinguishing features of these diagnoses are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"#H552741321\" class=\"local\">'Acute knee pain associated with trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of non-traumatic knee pain associated with an effusion can be narrowed based on the association with activity. Important, common causes of non-traumatic knee pain that increase acutely with activity include articular cartilage injury and osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"#H382908534\" class=\"local\">'Non-traumatic conditions associated WITH a joint effusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee pain associated with a joint effusion, despite the absence of any trauma or activity that exacerbates symptoms, is a concerning finding, and indicates the need for a more extensive workup. In addition to a careful history and examination, plain radiographs and knee joint aspiration are often necessary. Important causes of non-traumatic knee pain that is not associated with activity include crystal arthropathy (eg, gout), infectious (septic) arthritis, disseminated gonococcal infection, and systemic rheumatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H346688989\" class=\"local\">'Conditions NOT related to activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the many patients with knee pain not associated with acute trauma and without a knee effusion, the first step is to determine if the pain is exacerbated by activity. Some of these conditions may cause localized swelling, or an intermittent effusion, but nearly always this occurs with activity. It is important to ask patients that do not participate in regular physical exercise or labor if something in their day-to-day activity has changed (new job, recent vacation, recent work around the house, etc). The second, crucial step is to pinpoint the location of the pain. (See <a href=\"#H1795865037\" class=\"local\">'Non-traumatic conditions NOT associated with joint effusion'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Causes of anterior knee pain unrelated to acute trauma or a joint effusion include Osgood-Schlatter disease, Hoffa&rsquo;s fat pad syndrome, quadriceps and patellar tendinopathy, bursitis, plica syndrome, patellofemoral pain, and several conditions affecting the patella (eg, chronic subluxation, stress fracture).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Causes of medial knee pain unrelated to acute trauma or a joint effusion include degenerative medial meniscal tear, saphenous nerve entrapment, and pes anserine bursitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Causes of lateral knee pain unrelated to acute trauma or a joint effusion include iliotibial band syndrome and degenerative lateral meniscal tear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Causes of posterior knee pain unrelated to acute trauma or a joint effusion include popliteal artery aneurysm or entrapment, popliteal (Baker's) cyst, and popliteus tendinopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other, less common causes of knee pain, including bone tumors and referred pain, are discussed briefly in the text.
