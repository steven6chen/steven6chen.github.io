It is an electrically unstable rhythm, meaning that it frequently degenerates into atrial fibrillation or reverts to sinus rhythm within hours or days. In patients who present with or who have recurrent episodes associated with a rapid ventricular rate, slowing of the rate may be necessary to either reduce symptoms or prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. </p><p>For the purpose of this topic, rate control means lowering the heart rate, which in the case of atrial flutter is usually difficult to achieve. Thus, for many patients, radiofrequency ablation (and permanent restoration of sinus rhythm) is the preferred long-term approach to patients with atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'RF catheter ablation'</a>.)</p><p>The physiologic and clinical rationales for ventricular rate control in atrial flutter and the modalities used to achieve this goal will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the causes of atrial flutter, the embolic risk associated with this arrhythmia, and the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolic risk and the role of anticoagulation in atrial flutter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC BASIS FOR THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ventricular rate in atrial flutter is principally determined by the rate at which impulses exit the atrioventricular (AV) node. With a regular atrial rate of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> the ventricular rate is usually about 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. This ventricular rate is determined by the refractory period of a healthy AV node, such that every other impulse (2:1) traverses the AV node and travels to the ventricles. In the absence of drugs that slow AV nodal conduction, a higher degree of AV block (eg, 3:1 or 4:1) suggests AV nodal disease; in these settings, the ventricular rates would be roughly 100 and 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> respectively. &#160;</p><p>Even <span class=\"nowrap\">input/output</span> ratios (eg, 2:1 or 4:1 conduction) are more common than odd ratios (eg, 3:1 or 5:1). Odd ratios probably reflect bilevel block in the AV node. Sometimes, variable conduction may occur with alternating or seemingly random patterns of 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, or other conduction patterns, again due to varying levels of block in the AV node. On the other hand, a 1:1 response with typical atrial flutter usually suggests possible hyperthyroidism, catecholamine excess, parasympathetic withdrawal, or the existence of an accessory bypass tract in the pre-excitation syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy, pathophysiology, and localization of accessory pathways in the preexcitation syndrome&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>An important exception can occur in patients taking antiarrhythmic drugs, which can slow the atrial flutter rate so that 1:1 conduction occurs in circumstances such as the absence of a bypass tract or catecholamine excess. This occurs most commonly with the class IC drugs, particularly when used in the absence of concomitant AV nodal blocking agents, but can also occur with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> or even <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. Also, 1:1 conduction of &quot;slow&quot; atrial flutter can occur in patients with marked right atrial enlargement.</p><p>The AV node has been called a &quot;slow response&quot; tissue, since its action potential depends on calcium ions flowing through kinetically slow channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75699 \">figure 1</a>). The activation and reactivation characteristics of these channels limit the rate of conduction through the AV node. The autonomic nervous system can modify the rate of conduction, which is increased by sympathetic activity and reduced by parasympathetic activity.</p><p>It is useful to consider the electrophysiologic differences between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, since they can impact therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation is characterized by multiple wandering wavelets, which result in the AV node being bombarded by 400 to 600 impulses per minute. Some impulses traverse the AV node and reach the specialized infranodal conduction system and then the ventricles. However, most of the atrial impulses penetrate the AV node for varying distances and then are extinguished by encountering the refractoriness of an earlier wavefront; this phenomenon of concealed conduction in turn creates a refractory wave that affects succeeding impulses. The lack of shortening of the refractory period with increasing rate (as occurs in the atria) further decreases the likelihood of an impulse traversing the AV node. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In comparison, typical atrial flutter is a macroreentrant arrhythmia, resulting in approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">impulses/min</span> reaching the AV node. This slower rate produces less refractoriness within the AV node and therefore less concealed conduction than in atrial fibrillation.</p><p/><p>Based upon these observations, it would be expected that atrial fibrillation would be more sensitive than atrial flutter to drugs that affect AV nodal refractoriness; this prediction has been confirmed clinically. Stated another way, control of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter is more difficult than in atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rate control with drugs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR RATE CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three principle situations in which rate control should be considered: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate rate control to reduce symptoms during a first or subsequent episode in which a patient has not reverted to sinus rhythm (or spontaneously converted to atrial fibrillation); cardioversion should be considered, as it has a high likelihood of success.

Frequently, these patients may be more symptomatic with faster heart rates than when in atrial fibrillation. It may be difficult to rate control these patients, and antiarrhythmic agents, cardioversion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atrial flutter ablation are frequently necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications#H1228811936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmic complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The following two characteristics of atrial flutter render the need to decide about the initiation of rate slowing uncommon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial flutter is often an electrically unstable rhythm, meaning that it frequently degenerates into the less organized atrial fibrillation or reverts to sinus rhythm within hours or days. Spontaneous reversion to a sinus mechanism often occurs after predisposing problems are improved, such as decompensated heart failure (HF) and the sequelae of cardiac surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic atrial flutter is uncommon and is frequently associated with biventricular and biatrial enlargement, prior cardiac surgery or atrial fibrillation ablation, or congenital heart disease. In these patients, chronic therapy to control the ventricular response is generally difficult. <br/><br/>It is becoming a less common problem since in most patients with persistent atrial flutter, we attempt to cure the arrhythmia by ablating the re-entrant circuit. An exception to this general rule may occur if rapid atrial flutter is part of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or the sick sinus syndrome. Treatment in the former setting is essentially that for atrial fibrillation. However, patients with both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may benefit from ablation of the flutter circuit if rapid ventricular responses during atrial flutter are symptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13490261\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE CONTROL GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rate control targets have been described for atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], they are less useful in atrial flutter since, as noted above, atrioventricular block tends to go in steps (eg, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1). For most patients, we believe a ventricular rate at rest of less than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> is reasonable for symptomatic patients and less than 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with normal left ventricular systolic function. Rate control should be assessed both at rest and with exertion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE CONTROL WITH DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of therapy with drugs that slow atrioventricular (AV) conduction is to improve symptoms and prevent the development of a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. For patients who require immediate rate slowing, and for whom cardioversion (and the restoration of sinus rhythm) is not chosen, we prefer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> to other options. For patients who will be placed on long-term oral therapy for rate control, we prefer either diltiazem or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>.</p><p>The rate at which impulses from the atria exit the AV node is the principle determinant of the ventricular rate. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic basis for therapy'</a> above.) Thus, rate control in atrial flutter is achieved principally with drugs that slow conduction through the AV node.</p><p>The pharmacologic agents for controlling the ventricular rate in atrial flutter are based as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockade of the calcium channel with the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease sympathetic tone using beta-blockers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhancement of parasympathetic tone with vagotonic drugs, most frequently <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, which slows AV nodal conduction and increases AV nodal refractoriness</p><p/><p>However, as discussed above, the smaller amount of concealed conduction in the AV node because of the slower atrial rate in atrial flutter means that greater AV nodal refractoriness must be produced. As a result, higher doses of a single drug are required, and combination therapy at conventional doses is frequently needed to minimize toxicity. Difficulties with pharmacologic rate control make patients with atrial flutter excellent candidates for a curative catheter ablation procedure, which is often curative.

Diltiazem increases AV nodal refractoriness and slows conduction velocity in the AV node, thereby decreasing the ventricular response. Diltiazem has a less pronounced negative inotropic effect than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <br/><br/>There is a Food and Drug Administration-approved regimen for a continuous 24-hour intravenous diltiazem infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. This regimen consists of an intravenous bolus of 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (average adult dose 20 mg) over two minutes followed 15 minutes later by a second bolus of 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (average adult dose 25 mg) over two minutes if the first dose is tolerated but does not produce the desired response (20 percent reduction in heart rate from the baseline, conversion to sinus rhythm, or a heart rate less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min);</span> this is followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/h</span> in responders but not nonresponders; some patients respond to a 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/h</span> infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This regimen usually controls the ventricular rate within four to five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].<br/><br/>Monotherapy with oral diltiazem can be used to treat patients with persistent atrial flutter, as well as patients who have recurrent or persistent atrial fibrillation with episodic atrial flutter. The initial dose is 30 mg every six hours, and is increased to a maximum of 360 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Sustained release diltiazem is most commonly used as a once a day drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> &ndash; Verapamil, like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, increases refractoriness and decreases conduction velocity in the AV node, leading to reductions in the ventricular response in atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Intravenous verapamil can be given acutely in a dose of 5 to 10 mg over two to three minutes; this dose can be repeated every 15 to 30 minutes as necessary. The maintenance infusion rate is approximately 0.125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span>. The onset of action is within two minutes and the peak effect occurs in 10 to 15 minutes. Control of the ventricular response is lost in roughly 90 minutes if repeated boluses or a maintenance infusion are not given. <br/><br/>Similar to diltiazem, oral verapamil may be used to treat patients with persistent atrial flutter or patients with recurrent or persistent atrial fibrillation who have episodic atrial flutter. The initial dose of oral verapamil is 40 to 80 mg every six hours. This dose can be increased to a maximum of 360 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> if hepatic function is relatively normal.

However, SA nodal function is depressed in patients with the sick sinus syndrome, at least in part due to blockade of calcium channels and an inability of the sinus node to respond to catecholamines. Thus, if the normal reflex mechanism is impaired by therapy with a beta blocker, the addition of a calcium channel blocker can lead to slowing or, rarely, failure of SA nodal function.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of digoxin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly, although we do not use the intramuscular route because absorption is erratic. Intravenous digoxin begins to act within 15 to 30 minutes, with a peak effect attained in one to five hours. The relatively slow onset of action of digoxin is undesirable in patients with a rapid ventricular response. &#160;</p><p>A larger dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> than used in atrial fibrillation is required to control the ventricular rate in atrial flutter; as noted above, the smaller amount of concealed conduction in the AV node because of the slower atrial rate in atrial flutter means that greater AV nodal refractoriness must be produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored periodically in patients on persistent therapy. Although the correlation between drug concentration and ventricular rate control is poor, the presence of a low value is useful since it allows a higher dose to be administered. The use of high doses of digoxin is potentially hazardous if electric cardioversion is performed, since this combination increases the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>Junctional escape beats (as detected by similarity of the longest observed recurring R-R intervals on the electrocardiogram [ECG]) are common when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> has successfully slowed the ventricular rate. Giving additional digoxin in this setting will increase the degree of AV nodal block and produce periods of regular junctional rhythm. The change from single junctional escapes to periodic junctional rhythm usually signifies the development of digoxin toxicity. If the pulse is palpated but ECG not reviewed, it may be mistakenly assumed that the patient is in sinus rhythm.</p><p>However, it may be difficult to distinguish on the ECG between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>-induced complete heart block during atrial flutter and a slow, regular ventricular rate. In complete heart block, the R-R interval will not be an exact multiple of the atrial cycle length (A-A interval). In addition, the relationship between the QRS complex and flutter wave (ie, the point on the flutter wave where the QRS complex begins) is variable during complete heart block. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Amiodarone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> can be used for rate control, but it should be remembered that intravenous amiodarone can possibly promote reversion to sinus rhythm, albeit infrequently. Since cardioversion is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, amiodarone should generally not be used in patients who are not candidates for conversion to sinus rhythm because of inadequate anticoagulation.

It has been used for rate control in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias, mostly atrial fibrillation with some cases of atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Because of the long-term risk of adverse effects, amiodarone is not recommended for persistent rate control in patients with atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone: Monitoring and management of side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION OF THE AV NODE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction (AV node <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> His bundle) is uncommonly performed in patients with pure atrial flutter because of the high rate of success with radiofrequency ablation of the re-entrant circuit, which maintains sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The main indication for AV junction ablation is in patients with atrial flutter who have coincident atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'RF catheter ablation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435269936\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXCITATION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with atrial flutter and pre-excitation, therapy is aimed at reversion to sinus rhythm and subsequent treatment of the accessory pathway rather than rate control. The atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking drugs (calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) can paradoxically increase the ventricular response in patients with atrial flutter and pre-excitation by impairing conduction via the normal AV node-His-Purkinje system. This decreases retrograde concealed conduction in the accessory pathway, thereby improving antegrade conduction over the pathway. Acute treatment should be directed toward converting to normal sinus rhythm in these patients.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications for rate control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rate control in atrial flutter is often more difficult than in atrial fibrillation.
