In this setting, it is often difficult to determine whether the chest pain represents pleuritis. The presence of a rub, which may be transient, facilitates the diagnosis of pleurisy. </p><p>Pleural effusions in SLE are often bilateral (50 percent), exudative, and characterized by an elevation in pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients may also report cough, dyspnea, and fever. Effusions are commonly small, but may occasionally be massive. The fluid appearance varies from clear serous to serosanguineous to bloody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The total white cell count (with a predominance of either lymphocyte or polymorphonuclear cells) is lower in SLE-related effusions than in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; however, there is substantial overlap, so that the white cell count in an individual patient cannot be used to establish the diagnosis. In addition, pleural fluid glucose concentrations in SLE effusions are slightly lower than serum blood levels, whereas pleural glucose levels in rheumatoid effusions are significantly reduced. The pleural fluid pH is also low in 20 percent of SLE patients. While pleural fluid complement levels are often low in SLE and RA effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], we do not recommend obtaining these tests. </p><p>Fibrothorax is a rare complication of lupus pleuritis and can lead to dyspnea by preventing lung expansion.

Thus, the initial evaluation centers on the history and physical exam to determine whether other symptoms and signs suggest a flare of SLE, heart failure, or respiratory infection and a review of the patient&rsquo;s medications for drugs associated with drug-induced lupus.

For patients without known SLE, the diagnosis of acute lupus pneumonitis is suspected when the patient does not respond to empiric treatment for pneumonia and when extrapulmonary features of SLE are noted (eg, malar rash, oral ulcers, alopecia, polyserositis, abnormal urine sediment, renal insufficiency, cytopenia, thrombophilia, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, joint swelling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The characteristic pattern of PFTs in PAH is normal spirometry and lung volumes, a reduced 6MWD, and oxygen desaturation of &ge;5 mmHg.

The principal aPLs measured for clinical use are the anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein (GP) I, and the lupus anticoagulant (LA). If CTEPH is suspected as the cause of elevated pulmonary artery pressures, a ventilation-perfusion lung scan can be used to differentiate PAH from CTEPH: patients with CTEPH have at least one (usually several) segmental or larger mismatched ventilation-perfusion defects, while patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension usually have a normal or mottled perfusion scan characterized by subsegmental defects.

Pleurisy, coughing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspnea are often the first clues either to lung involvement or to SLE itself. Patients with SLE and lung involvement must always be evaluated for infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleural inflammation</strong> can cause pleuritic chest pain with or without radiographic evidence of a pleural effusion. Pleural disease in SLE often responds to therapy with NSAIDs; those who do not respond to NSAIDs within a few days may require a short course of glucocorticoids. Chest wall pain is also a common cause of pleuritic-type pain in SLE and derives from inflammation of muscles, connective tissues, or the costochondral joints; such chest wall pain generally responds to local heat, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical analgesics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pleural disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H402634822\" class=\"local\">'Chest wall pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute lupus pneumonitis</strong> is uncommon and characterized by the rapid onset of fever, cough (sometimes with hemoptysis), dyspnea, pulmonary opacities on radiograph, hypoxemia, and basilar crackles. Serum antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies are commonly present. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Acute pneumonitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnosis of acute lupus pneumonitis is based on the clinical and serologic evidence of SLE and the exclusion of heart failure, infection, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, drug toxicity, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are able to undergo flexible bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage can help to exclude alternative diagnoses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While clinical trials are not available to guide treatment, better survival appears to be associated with prompt initiation of systemic glucocorticoids. Additional immunosuppression may be required depending on comorbidities and response to therapy. Empiric antibiotics should be given pending culture results. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary hemorrhage</strong> is a rare, life-threatening complication in SLE. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Affected patients appear acutely ill and commonly complain of dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis. The bleeding may be sufficient to induce anemia; lupus nephritis may also be present. Bilateral diffuse or patchy opacities are typical on chest radiographs and CT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The evaluation of patients with suspected DAH should be pursued expeditiously due to the life-threatening nature of the disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104832 \">table 2</a>). Flexible bronchoscopy with sequential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is the preferred diagnostic modality to confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternate diagnoses (eg, infection). A progressively more hemorrhagic BAL effluent supports the diagnosis. Sometimes, a definitive diagnosis can be made only by lung biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment is initiated promptly with high-dose glucocorticoids usually in combination with additional immunosuppressive agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. Benefit has also been reported with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). (See <a href=\"#H104441394\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interstitial lung disease</strong> (ILD) in patients with SLE typically has an insidious onset of chronic nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and decreased exercise tolerance. PFTs typically reveal a restrictive pattern (eg, reduced total lung capacity and forced vital capacity), diminished diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and oxygen desaturation with activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning is the standard for determining the presence of ILD and defining its radiographic pattern, which often correlates with a specific histopathologic diagnosis. BAL may be used to exclude infection and eosinophilia (may suggest drug toxicity). Lung biopsy may be required if the diagnosis is still in doubt despite imaging and BAL. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of inflammatory disease (eg, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia) requires the use of a glucocorticoid, with an additional immunomodulating agent. Fibrotic disease (eg, usual interstitial pneumonia) is less likely to benefit from such therapy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial lung disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary hypertension</strong> (PH) is a rare complication of SLE and usually presents with dyspnea, palpitations, fatigue, and impaired exercise tolerance. The diagnosis and management of patients with PH due to SLE that is not due to pulmonary embolic disease is similar to that of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The shrinking lung syndrome</strong> (SLS) is noted in less than 10 percent of patients with SLE. SLS is characterized by dyspnea, episodes of pleuritic chest pain, a progressive decrease in lung volume, and no evidence of interstitial fibrosis or significant pleural disease on chest CT. It is unclear whether SLS is due to myopathy or pleuritis, but systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy have been beneficial in case reports. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Shrinking lung syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other pulmonary disorders associated with SLE include thromboembolic disease, the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and infection.
