The following discussion will review each step in the procedure and provide evidence-based recommendations for surgical technique, when these data are available. In many cases, small absolute differences in outcome among surgical techniques are not clinically important; in these settings, time and cost savings assume greater importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Other aspects of cesarean delivery are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repeat-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repeat cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery on maternal request&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OPENING THE ABDOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advantages and disadvantages of various incisions and the procedure for opening the abdomen from skin to peritoneum are generally the same as for and open abdominal surgery.

Although we rarely perform a vertical midline incision, we often select this approach when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incision-to-delivery time is critical</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transverse incision may not provide adequate exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has a bleeding diathesis and thus is at increased risk of subcutaneous or subfascial hematoma formation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2081098595\"><span class=\"h4\">Transverse incisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two common transverse incisions for cesarean delivery are the Pfannenstiel type and the Joel-Cohen type incisions (eg, Misgav Ladach) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113066\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113066 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Pfannenstiel skin incision is slightly curved, 2 to 3 cm above the symphysis pubis, with the midportion of the incision within the clipped area of the pubic hair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Joel-Cohen type incision is straight, 3 cm below the line that joins the anterior superior iliac spines, and slightly more cephalad than Pfannenstiel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>In meta-analyses of randomized trials of surgical incisions for cesarean delivery, the Joel-Cohen type incision had significant short-term advantages compared with the Pfannenstiel incision, including lower rates of fever, postoperative pain, and use of analgesia; less blood loss; and shorter operating time (overall and incision-to-delivery) and hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In two trials (411 women) comparing the incisions, the Joel-Cohen incision resulted in a 65 percent reduction in postoperative febrile morbidity (relative risk [RR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.87) and a 45 percent reduction in postoperative analgesic requirements (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.76), as well as shorter incision to delivery time (mean difference [MD] -1.90, 95% CI -2.53 to -1.27 minutes), shorter operating time (MD -11.40, 95% CI -16.55 to -6.25 minutes), lower estimated blood loss (MD -58.00, 95% CI -108.51 to -7.49 mL), lower total dose of analgesia in the first 24 hours (MD -0.89, 95% CI -1.19 to -0.59), and shorter postoperative maternal hospital stay (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.16 to -0.84 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many practitioners continue to prefer the Pfannenstiel incision, in part because it is somewhat lower on the abdomen and therefore has a less negative cosmetic appearance.</p><p>In severely obese women, a supraumbilical transverse incision may be preferable to a suprapubic incision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery of the obese woman&quot;, section on 'Abdominal wall incision'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4072285422\"><span class=\"h4\">Vertical incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with transverse incisions, a vertical midline incision generally allows faster abdominal entry, causes less bleeding and superficial nerve injury, and can be easily extended cephalad if more space is required for access. In a prospective cohort study including over 3500 emergency cesarean deliveries, that median incision to delivery interval was faster for vertical than transverse skin incisions (three versus four minutes for primary cesareans and three versus five minutes for repeat cesareans), but neonatal outcomes were not improved, and some maternal and neonatal outcomes were worse in the vertical incision group (eg, need for postpartum maternal transfusion [8.5 versus 5.3 percent], neonatal intubation in the delivery room [17 versus 13 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The poorer outcomes were attributed to unidentified confounders since the choice of skin incision is not independent of the indication for cesarean delivery.</p><p>In severely obese women, a supraumbilical vertical incision may be preferable to a subumbilical vertical incision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery of the obese woman&quot;, section on 'Abdominal wall incision'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343607380\"><span class=\"h3\">Scalpel or electrocautery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At all stages of the cesarean procedure, the author prefers using the scalpel for sharp dissection, rather than an electrocautery device, but there is no clear evidence of superiority for short- or long-term outcomes between the two, and so surgeon's preference is reasonable. The body of evidence from randomized trials in general surgery patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] and a small trial in women undergoing repeat cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] show that neither scalpel nor electrosurgery holds a clinically significant benefit over the other; either approach or a mixture of the two approaches is acceptable (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H174471782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Skin incision'</a>). It is not necessary to change to a fresh scalpel blade after opening the abdomen, given that the rate of wound infection appears to be similar with a one-scalpel versus two-scalpel technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Subcutaneous tissue layer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials comparing techniques for incision and dissection of the subcutaneous tissues at cesarean delivery. We prefer blunt dissection (with fingers) over sharp dissection (with the knife), as blunt dissection has been associated with shorter operative times, less chance of injury to vessels, and less postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The tissue is opened from medial to lateral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fascial layer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small transverse incision is usually made medially with the scalpel, and then extended laterally with scissors. Alternatively, the fascial incision can be extended bluntly by inserting the fingers of each hand under the fascia and then pulling in a cephalad-caudad direction, which is part of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Joel-Cohen/Misgav-Ladach</span> technique&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Alternative techniques'</a> below). A randomized trial of sharp versus blunt fascial incision used each patient as her own control (sharp dissection for half the incision and blunt dissection for the other half) and found no difference in postoperative pain scores, but was too small to detect modest differences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Rectus muscle layer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectus muscles can be separated bluntly in most cases. Transection of the muscles (ie, Maylard technique) is avoided, if possible, as leaving the muscles intact preserves muscle strength in the early postoperative months; otherwise, there are no clear differences in outcome between the two techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>Dissection of the rectus fascia from the rectus muscles appears to be unnecessary, although commonly performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/15,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,20</a>]. In one small randomized trial, non-dissection resulted in higher postoperative hemoglobin levels and less pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Opening the peritoneum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We favor using fingers to bluntly open the peritoneum to minimize the risk of inadvertent injury to bowel, bladder, or other organs that may be adherent to the underlying surface, as in the Joel-Cohen type approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/15,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,20</a>]. However, a sharp technique is also acceptable. In a large randomized trial (CORONIS) that examined five elements of the cesarean delivery technique in intervention pairs, there was no significant difference between blunt and sharp technique for the primary composite outcome of maternal death, infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion &gt;1 unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>An extraperitoneal approach is another option. Most obstetricians are not familiar with this technique since it was used primarily in the pre-antibiotic era to decrease the risk of intraperitoneal infection. It requires a detailed knowledge of the relationship between the fascial planes and the bladder and lower uterine segment. Theoretically, avoiding exposure of the peritoneal cavity to blood, amniotic fluid, vernix, and mechanical irritation can potentially reduce nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain, voiding disturbances, and other side effects and complications of cesarean delivery. This hypothesis is supported by a small randomized trial that compared the transperitoneal and extraperitoneal techniques and found the latter resulted in less intraoperative nausea and vomiting and less postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20293380\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoiding visceral injury in patients with dense intraperitoneal adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there are dense adhesions between the anterior abdominal wall and the anterior surface of the uterus, we enter the peritoneum bluntly and as close as possible to the upper abdomen to avoid these areas. Sharp dissection also may be needed, and should be performed cautiously using shallow incisions under direct vision. Other approaches are to start laterally or use a paravesical or supravesical extraperitoneal approach to avoid dense midline adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>A surgeon experienced in complex abdominal surgery should assist if meticulous dissection of dense adhesions involving important structures is needed. Insertion of ureteral stents can be useful to facilitate intraoperative identification (and avoidance) of the ureters, but is rarely indicated for cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic ureteral catheters'</a>.)</p><p>If pelvic adhesions require extensive dissection with risk of injury to the bowel, urinary tract, or major blood vessels to expose the lower uterine segment, and the patient desires tubal ligation, we avoid or minimize adhesiolysis and perform the hysterotomy in the most appropriate accessible location. A case report in which the entire length of the ventral aspect of the uterus and bladder was densely adherent to the rectus sheath described extending a vertical incision in the abdominal wall above the level of the adhesions and then entering the uterine cavity through an incision across the fundus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ensuring adequate exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The full thickness abdominal wall incision should be adequate to allow easy delivery of the fetus. While there are no trials on this technical aspect of cesarean delivery, a 15 cm incision (the size of a standard Allis clamp) is probably the minimal length that allows atraumatic and expeditious delivery of the term fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] The surgeon and an assistant together can manually stretch apart the opening at the angles of the incisions if needed, but additional sharp dissection may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAABDOMINAL PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder flap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely create a bladder flap. In a meta-analysis of four trials that randomly assigned women to undergo or not undergo development of a bladder flap at cesarean delivery, omitting this procedure did not increase short-term adverse outcomes (bladder injury, blood loss, duration of hospitalization) and reduced the incision-to-delivery interval by 1.3 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The trials excluded very preterm and emergency deliveries. These data are inadequate to definitively assess uncommon morbidities, such as bladder injury, or the long-term consequences of not creating a bladder flap, such as long-term bladder function.</p><p>A subsequent randomized trial found that urinary symptom scores at 6 to 8&nbsp;weeks postpartum were similar whether or not a bladder flap was performed, but women who received a bladder flap had more bothersome urinary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Some obstetricians choose to selectively perform a bladder flap if a difficult delivery is anticipated, such as when the fetal head is deep in the pelvis or when the bladder is attached well above the lower uterine segment after a previous cesarean delivery. In these cases, creation of the bladder flap may help to keep the bladder dome out of the surgical field if the uterine incision extends. In some patients, such as those who are not in labor, it may not be possible to make an incision in the lower uterine segment without first creating a bladder flap.</p><p>The location of the bladder is best delineated by palpating the bladder catheter, if present. The demarcation between the lower and upper uterine segments is difficult to determine clinically, sonographically, or histologically. The location or level of the demarcation also changes based on the clinical situation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysterotomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87280904\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterine incision is usually transverse but may be vertical; no randomized trials have compared the two techniques. The principal consideration is that the incision must be large enough to allow atraumatic delivery of the fetus. Factors to consider include the position and size of the fetus, location of the placenta, presence of leiomyomas, development of the lower uterine segment, and future pregnancy plans. Small comparative studies of transverse and vertical incisions have not reported a difference in incision to delivery time or short-term maternal and infant outcomes between the two techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, if the woman has a subsequent pregnancy, she may be at higher risk of uterine rupture if she has a low vertical incision and chooses to undergo a trial of labor.</p><p>Prior to making a hysterotomy incision, the surgeon should be aware of the general location of the placenta and the fetal lie. This information helps in avoiding laceration of the placenta and in delivery of the fetus. If labor has been prolonged and the head is deep in the pelvis, the lower uterine segment may be very thin and retracted superiorly. In these cases, it is important to avoid making the incision too inferiorly as it may transect the cervix or vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Transverse incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most cesarean deliveries, we recommend making a transverse incision along the lower uterine segment (ie, Monro Kerr or Kerr incision). Compared with vertical incisions, advantages of the transverse incision include less blood loss, less need for bladder dissection, easier reapproximation, and a lower risk of rupture in subsequent pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is the best incision for women who are planning another pregnancy and may attempt a trial of labor in that pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth#H15065559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;, section on 'One prior low transverse uterine incision'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth#H15065573\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;, section on 'Prior low vertical uterine incision'</a>.)</p><p>The major disadvantage of the transverse incision is that significant lateral extension is not possible without risking laceration of major blood vessels. A &quot;J&quot; or inverted &quot;T&quot; extension is often required if a larger incision is needed. This can be problematic because the &quot;J&quot; extension goes into the lateral fundus and the angles of the inverted &quot;T&quot; incision are poorly vascularized. Both the J and T incisions potentially result in a weaker uterine scar, which is a concern if the patient has a subsequent pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Low vertical and classical incisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of vertical incisions: the low vertical (Kronig, DeLee, or Cornell) and the classical vertical. The low vertical is performed in the lower uterine segment and appears to be as strong as the low transverse incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The major disadvantage of the low vertical incision is the possibility of extension cephalad into the uterine fundus or caudally into the bladder, cervix, or vagina. It is also difficult to determine whether the low vertical incision is truly low, as the separation between lower and upper uterine segments is not easily identifiable.</p><p>A vertical incision that extends into the upper uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">segment/fundus</span> is termed a classical incision. This incision is rarely performed at or near term because in subsequent pregnancies it is associated with a higher frequency of uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">dehiscence/rupture</span> (4 to 9 percent) compared with low vertical (1 to 7 percent) and low transverse (0.2 to 1.5 percent) incisions; it is also associated with more maternal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether a vertical incision is confined to the lower, noncontractile portion of the myometrium (low vertical) or extends into the upper contractile portion of the myometrium (classical) is a subjective assessment; an objective method for differentiating between the two types of uterine incisions has not been determined. However, if the incision extends to the level or near the level of the round ligament insertion, it should definitively be considered classical.</p><p>The generally accepted indications for considering a vertical uterine incision are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly developed lower uterine segment when more than normal intrauterine manipulation is anticipated (eg, extremely preterm breech presentation, back down transverse lie).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower uterine segment pathology that precludes a transverse incision (eg, large leiomyoma, anterior placenta previa or accreta).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Densely adherent bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmortem delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery of a very large fetus (eg, anomalous, extreme macrosomia) when there is high risk of extension of a transverse incision into uterine vessels or a T or J extension may be required to extract the fetus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87280975\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterotomy is begun by making a small incision with a scalpel. Various techniques are used to minimize the risk of fetal injury while making this incision. All involve elevating and carefully thinning the inner myometrial and decidual layers to minimize bleeding, maximize exposure, and promote separation of the uterine tissue from the fetal membranes or skin.</p><p>After the initial incision on the uterus has been made with the scalpel, and most of the uterine wall has been cut, we prefer to enter the uterine cavity with the index finger of the dominant hand of the surgeon, in a blunt fashion. This is effective &gt;90 percent of the time in our experience, and avoids any risks of fetal injury with a sharp instrument. If this is not easily accomplishable, the next steps may be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider applying Allis clamps to the superior and inferior edges of the myometrial incision and elevate them, as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the suction tip and directly apply the end of the suction tubing to the center of the myometrial incision to balloon out and thin out this layer while providing easily identifiable, relatively blood-free exposure. If possible, leave the membranes intact until complete extension of the incision.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2166808243\"><span class=\"h4\">Expanding the incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the uterine cavity is entered, the hysterotomy incision is extended using blunt expansion with the surgeon's fingers or bandage scissors. We recommend blunt expansion because it is fast and has less risk of inadvertent trauma to the fetus. Extending the uterine incision transversely by pulling vertically (cephalocaudal) with the index fingers also reduces the risk of unintended extension and excessive blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/20,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34</a>]. In a 2014 systematic <span class=\"nowrap\">review/meta-analysis</span> of six randomized trials of blunt versus sharp hysterotomy, blunt expansion resulted in a lower rate of unintended extensions (pooled relative risk [RR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.28-0.79) and a lower drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit postpartum, and shortened operative time by two minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1442336584\"><span class=\"h4\">Uterine stapler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not use the auto stapler. A meta-analysis of two small randomized trials did not show any benefits over conventional sharp dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This technique should be reserved, if used at all, for rare indications (eg, ex utero intrapartum treatment [EXIT] procedure).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetus should be extracted expeditiously and nontraumatically. Most studies, but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], have reported a direct association between a prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery time and lower fetal blood gas pH values and Apgar scores, regardless of type of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The mechanism is thought to be hysterotomy-induced increased uterine tone, which can interfere with uteroplacental blood flow.</p><p>Extraction of the fetus at cesarean is usually uncomplicated. For fetuses in cephalic presentation, the key points are getting the obstetrician's fingers around the curvature of the head for leverage, lifting without overly flexing the wrist, and using the lower uterine segment as a fulcrum, which, if done improperly, can lead to extensions of the hysterotomy incision. The obstetrician usually inserts <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> dominant hand through the hysterotomy incision and around the top of the fetal head. Standing on a stool may be helpful. Using the fingers and palm, the head is gently elevated and flexed to bring the occiput into the open hysterotomy, and then guided through the incision, aided by modest transabdominal fundal pressure from the other hand or an assistant, as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80515\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80515 \">figure 2</a>). The shoulders are then delivered using gentle traction to guide one, and then the other, through the hysterotomy, using fundal pressure as needed; the rest of the body should follow easily.</p><p>Extreme prematurity, a deeply impacted or floating fetal head, or an abnormal lie can make fetal extraction difficult.

It is hypothesized that spontaneous expulsion allows the uterus time to contract and thus close myometrial sinuses. It also avoids potential contamination of open sinuses from any bacteria on the surgeon's gloves, although this does not appear to be clinically significant since changing gloves before manual removal of the placenta does not reduce the risk of endometritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>To ensure that the entire placenta has been removed, the uterus is usually wiped with a gauge sponge to remove any remaining membranes or placental tissue.

This opinion is based on a randomized trial that assigned 78 term pregnant patients delivered by cesarean to one layer myometrial closure either including or excluding the endometrial layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Given the available data (see below), either a one- or two-layer closure technique is within acceptable standards of medical practice. If a single-layer closure is performed to save time, we suggest an unlocked technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. A double (or even triple)-layer closure may be necessary when the myometrium is thick, such as with a classical and some low vertical incisions.</p><p>Short-term maternal outcomes are similar for single- and double-layer closure, except a single-layer closure takes less time. In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies, single- and double-layer hysterotomy closure resulted in similar rates of overall maternal infectious morbidity, endometritis, wound infection, and blood transfusion, but operative time was six minutes shorter with the single-layer closure (20 studies including almost 15,000 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Over the long term, however, uterine rupture in the next pregnancy is a potential risk of single-layer closure. In a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized trials (3969 pregnancies), single- and double-layer uterine incision closure resulted in a similar incidence of cesarean scar defects (25 and 43 percent, respectively; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36-1.64), uterine dehiscence (0.4 and 0.2 percent, respectively; RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.24-4.82), and rupture in a subsequent pregnancy (0.1 percent for both; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.05-5.53), but single-layer closure resulted in thinner residual myometrial thickness on postpartum ultrasound (mean difference -2.19 mm, 95% CI -2.80-1.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Available data were of low quality due to imprecision and indirectness and thus do not provide convincing evidence of safety or harm.</p><p>The technique used for the single-layer closure may be a contributing factor. Compared with an unlocked closure, locked closure has been associated with higher occurrence of surrogate markers of scar weakness (thinner myometrial thickness, bell-shaped uterine wall defects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>] and <span class=\"nowrap\">dehiscence/rupture</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. As discussed above, inclusion of the <span class=\"nowrap\">decidua/endometrium</span> (full thickness suturing technique) appears to be another factor that impacts scar strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, available data are limited by heterogeneity in criteria for diagnosis of uterine scar defects, length of follow-up, method of follow-up, and closure technique, as well as lack of randomization for the primary outcome and the low number of uterine ruptures.</p><p>There is also a paucity of data on other long-term outcomes. A secondary analysis of data from a prospective study of women undergoing repeat cesarean delivery observed an increased risk of bladder adhesions in women who had undergone single-layer closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

We use continuous sutures to close the inner myometrial layer; others prefer interrupted sutures, including interrupted vertical figure of eight sutures. It is useful to have an assistant manually reapproximate the incision by pushing the myometrium on each side toward the midline as each suture is placed and tied. This reduces tension on the incision and helps prevent the suture from tearing through the myometrium, especially when closing the first layer. The mid-portion of the thick myometrial layer is closed with a second line of sutures, leaving approximately 1 cm of outer myometrium still open. We then close the serosa and outer layer using a baseball stitch, which is hemostatic and minimizes exposed raw surfaces, and thus may reduce adhesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113004 \">figure 3</a>). The baseball stitch is a continuous, unlocked stitch in which the needle is driven through the cut edge of the myometrium to exit the serosa a few millimeters from the incision for each needle bite.

However, in a large randomized trial including non-cesarean surgeries (pregnant women excluded), a technique of 5 mm tissue bites and 5 mm inter-suture spacing limited to the aponeurosis and using a 2-0 suture on a small needle resulted in fewer incisional hernias at one year than the classic 1 cm by 1 cm technique (13 versus 21 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[35/277</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">57/277];</span> odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Obstetricians also commonly use this technique with 0 or 1 braided suture (eg, polyglactin 910).

Strengths of this trial include that its primary objective was to examine adhesion formation at a repeat cesarean delivery, use of an adhesion scoring system, exclusion of patients who had had prior pelvic or abdominal surgery, use of a standard technique for performing the cesareans, and blinding the surgeon performing the repeat cesarean to patient allocation.</p><p>However, the effect of non-closure on adhesion formation remains unclear because of the small number of patients who have undergone follow-up at a second cesarean delivery. Non-closure might allow the enlarged uterus to adhere to the anterior abdominal wall or impede spontaneous closure of the peritoneum, while closure might cause a foreign body reaction to sutures and tissue damage. In a 2009 systematic review of prospective observational studies of peritoneal non-closure at cesarean delivery, non-closure was associated with greater adhesion formation than closure of the parietal layer or both visceral and parietal layers (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.48-4.56; three studies, n = 249) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The studies were included if the primary objective was to examine adhesion formation at a repeat cesarean delivery, had a clear study design, had an adhesion scoring system, and excluded patients who had adhesions at the primary cesarean or who had interim surgeries after the primary cesarean. Many studies were excluded from this review because of poor methodologic design or clinical heterogeneity. However, a 2011 systematic review that included many of these excluded observational studies also found that non-closure was associated with greater adhesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Reapproximation of rectus muscles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and most other clinicians believe that the rectus muscles reapproximate naturally and suturing them together may cause unnecessary pain when the woman starts to move after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Compared with no drain, routine use of drains does not reduce the odds of seroma, hematoma, infection, or wound disruption. Additionally, restricted use of subrectus sheath drains offers no benefit in maternal infectious morbidity compared with liberal use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. These findings also apply to obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer to reapproximate the skin with subcuticular suture rather than staples. In a 2015 meta-analysis of randomized trials, women whose incisions were closed with suture had fewer wound complications than those closed with staples (relative risk [RR] 0.49; 95% CI 0.28-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The decrease in wound complications was largely due to fewer wound separations with sutured closure (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.20-0.43); differences in infection, hematoma, seroma, and readmission rates were not significant. Cosmetic appearance, pain perception at discharge, and patient satisfaction were similar for both approaches. Suture placement took 7 minutes longer than stapled closure, but the time involved to remove staples before or after hospital discharge also needs to be considered.</p><p>The best type of suture is unclear; most surgeons use poliglecaprone (monofilament) or polyglactin (braided). A randomized trial of 275 women who underwent scheduled or nonemergent&nbsp;cesarean delivery through a Pfannenstiel skin incision found that poliglecaprone 25 resulted in a lower rate of overall wound complications compared with polyglactin 910 (8.8 versus 14.4 percent, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-0.99), but the wide confidence interval in this trial, as well as the lack of other randomized trials of this issue, preclude making a strong recommendation for one suture over the other at this time. Barbed sutures reduce closure time and may result in a better cosmetic appearance, but data are limited and not from trials of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/91-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several techniques to simplify the surgical approach, decrease operating time, and reduce postoperative morbidity have been proposed. It is impossible to assess which technical aspects of a particular method of cesarean delivery are clearly advantageous because several aspects of the method are studied at the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Furthermore, long-term outcomes have not been adequately evaluated.</p><p>The Pelosi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and Misgav Ladach (also known as modified Joel-Cohen or Joel-Cohen-Stark) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70112 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] approaches have incorporated many modifications of standard and Joel-Cohen techniques. As discussed above, the Joel-Cohen type incision is associated with less fever, pain, use of analgesia, blood loss, operating time, and hospital days compared with the standard Pfannenstiel incision (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Skin incision'</a> above) and, in one randomized trial, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Joel-Cohen/Misgav</span> Ladach method resulted in fewer patients with intraperitoneal adhesions at repeat cesarean delivery (11 percent versus 36 percent after standard Pfannenstiel-Kerr approach) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>The Pelosi technique is illustrated by the following photographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82474%7EOBGYN%2F68054%7EOBGYN%2F59263%7EOBGYN%2F59263%7EOBGYN%2F66859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82474 graphicRef68054 graphicRef59263 graphicRef59263 graphicRef66859 \">picture 1A-C, 1C-D</a>).

A transverse incision is associated with better cosmetic appearance and possibly less postoperative pain and greater wound strength than the vertical midline incision. However, the incision to delivery time appears to be approximately one minute faster with vertical skin incisions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Choice of incision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A scalpel or electrocautery can be used for tissue dissection, based on the surgeon's preference. (See <a href=\"#H343607380\" class=\"local\">'Scalpel or electrocautery?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fascial incision can be extended sharply or bluntly. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fascial layer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We leave the rectus muscles intact rather than using the Maylard technique. This improves abdominal muscle strength in the short-term. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Rectus muscle layer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use fingers to bluntly open the peritoneum to minimize the risk of inadvertent injury to bowel, bladder, or other organs that may be adherent to the underlying surface. However, a sharp technique is also acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Opening the peritoneum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely create a bladder flap. This saves time and reduces blood loss. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bladder flap'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the hysterotomy, we suggest a low transverse rather than a low vertical incision for most women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The low transverse incision is associated with less blood loss, less need for bladder dissection, is easier to reapproximate, and has a lower risk of rupture in subsequent pregnancies. However, a low vertical hysterotomy is preferable in some settings, such as a poorly developed lower uterine segment or lower uterine segment pathology. It also is preferable for delivery of a very large fetus (eg, anomalous, extreme macrosomia) when there is high risk of extension of a transverse incision into uterine vessels or a T or J extension may be required to extract the fetus. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hysterotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest blunt rather than sharp expansion of the hysterotomy incision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Blunt expansion is quick and has less risk of inadvertent trauma to the fetus, and may reduce blood loss and extension of the incision. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hysterotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend spontaneous, rather than manual, extraction of the placenta (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Spontaneous extraction is associated with lower rates of endometritis and bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Placental extraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exteriorization or non-exteriorization of the uterus are both acceptable approaches. The choice depends on personal preference and the clinical setting. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Exteriorizing the uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who would consider a trial of labor after a previous cesarean delivery, we suggest a two-layer uterine closure rather than a one-layer closure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Single- versus double-layer closure of lower uterine segment incisions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not closing the visceral or parietal peritoneum (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Non-closure saves time and there is no convincing evidence of harm (increased adhesion formation). (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Reapproximation of the peritoneum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with subcutaneous tissue depth &ge;2 cm, we recommend closure of the subcutaneous tissue layer with sutures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Closure decreases the risk of subsequent wound disruption. (See <a href=\"#H4082389166\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous tissue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women who have received standard antibiotic prophylaxis, abdominal irrigation probably does not further reduce maternal infectious morbidity. Wound irrigation is also unlikely to be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal irrigation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4082389166\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous tissue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend not routinely placing a subcutaneous drain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Routine use of drains does not reduce the odds of seroma, hematoma, infection, or wound disruption. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Drains'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest reapproximation of the skin with subcuticular suture rather than staples (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), but either technique is reasonable.
