As the donor and recipient selection criteria for transplantation expand, in combination with the continued introduction of new immunosuppressive agents, the ability to identify the optimal immunosuppressive regimen for a given individual has grown increasingly complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/3-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-21</a>]. In addition, with improved graft and patient survival secondary to improved immunosuppression, trial outcome measures have also evolved, making individual trial results difficult to compare. To combat this difficulty, a critical, systematic, and scientific method for evaluating ongoing results from clinical trials is needed.</p><p>Evidence-based medicine is the explicit and judicious use of current and best evidence to guide clinical decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Evidence-based medicine must be considered in the context of clinical expertise and with the understanding that its use is based on published literature, which is subject to reporting bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>]. Several guidelines for the publication and design of clinical trials in solid organ transplant recipients have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the principles of evidence-based medicine in the evaluation of immunosuppressive regimens in renal transplantation. More general issues related to evidence-based medicine and decision analysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based medicine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decision-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Decision analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STUDY DESIGN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials are the most appropriate design to prove the effectiveness of a new treatment. However, this design may not always be feasible or ethical in renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/23,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,29</a>].</p><p>Previously, the gold standard used to assess the efficacy of a new immunosuppressant agent alone or in combination was graft survival and the incidence of acute rejection, with the latter being a predictor for long-term graft survival. However, improvements in short- and long-term allograft survival and the significant decrease in acute rejection rates have led researchers to alternative study designs and endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, well-designed randomized, controlled clinical studies that specifically address questions regarding immunosuppressant or immunosuppressive agent combinations are still warranted in renal transplantation. With the explosion in the number of clinical trials evaluating immunosuppressive agents, meta-analyses have been used to address some of the limitations of these small and often underpowered clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. However, such analyses have inherent limitations, including study heterogeneity and nonspecific or noncomparable endpoints and the inability to directly extrapolate findings to clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/24,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34-36</a>].</p><p>Analyses of data from large-scale databases such as the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) and the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) have also been performed to identify the optimal immunosuppressive regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Retrospective analyses of registry data are limited by the quality of the data reported, the various hidden sources of bias, and the inability to establish causal relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT POPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When applying results from clinical trials to the individual transplant recipient or transplant center, clinicians must consider several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of transplant (deceased or living donor)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary or repeat transplant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of sensitization (as reflected in the percentage of panel reactive antibody)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethnicity of the study population</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold ischemia time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incidence of delayed graft function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause of recipient end-stage renal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritransplant comorbidities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion criteria (eg, pediatric recipient, multiorgan transplant, previous nonrenal transplant recipient)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When transplants were performed (pre- or post-kidney allocation system [KAS])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant immunosuppression and the impact on overall drug exposure</p><p/><p>These factors can affect clinical outcomes such as acute allograft rejection, short- and long-term graft function, and graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Careful evaluation of these factors will provide the basis for employing results of clinical trials to the individual recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE REGIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the increasing number of immunosuppressive agents available, the number of available immunosuppression combinations has grown exponentially. Immunosuppression used in treatment and control groups should be comparable and current so as to limit the introduction of systematic bias. As an example, a study comparing a regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> with a regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil would not be comparable because there is more than one difference between the treatment groups. In addition, concomitant agents that may influence surrogate endpoints, such as infection, should also be controlled. Thus, if the trial is evaluating two different maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, both study groups should receive the same type of induction therapy and concomitant prophylactic therapies. The transplant community has identified the need for unified definitions of infections following transplant in an attempt to increase the external validity of trial results that use them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The immunosuppression regimen should include a description of the target dose; the target drug levels (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>); and the type of formulation used (nonmodified or modified cyclosporine, immediate- or extended-release tacrolimus) to enable appropriate interpretation and extrapolation of results. More often, a trend toward a comparison of immunosuppressive regimens is described rather than comparisons of the individual agents. Secondary to the importance of reporting and evaluating biomarkers of immunosuppressant efficacy, groups have published consensus reports discussing specific agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>This trend is based upon the increasing number of immunosuppressant agents and the notable redundancy in the immune system necessitating the use of multiple agents with different mechanisms of action. Genetic variations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of immunosuppressant agents and subsequent responses have increased the awareness and need for &quot;patient-specific or individualized&quot; immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Significant improvements in long-term renal allograft survival with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> have led investigators to focus more on optimizing long-term patient outcomes related to minimizing immunosuppressant exposure. These lower-toxicity regimens are designed to either eliminate or reduce the toxicities of glucocorticoids or calcineurin inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Examples of these regimens include glucocorticoid-free, avoidance, or early-withdrawal regimens, and calcineurin-inhibitor free, avoidance, or withdrawal regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H966010383\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIAL OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, there has been limited standardization of outcomes reported in trials in kidney transplantation. The heterogeneity of outcomes and lack of patient-relevant outcomes across trials has made it more difficult for clinicians and patients to compare the benefits and risks of different treatments, interventions, and monitoring strategies. Efforts are in progress to define a core set of outcomes that reflects the priorities of both patients and health professionals and can be used across all trials in transplantation.</p><p>An international, multidisciplinary group of investigators has published the findings of two Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Kidney Transplantation (SONG-Tx) stakeholder consensus workshops, the goals of which were to discuss the development and implementation of core outcome domains for trials in kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Participants included patients and caregivers with current or previous experience with kidney transplantation, as well as health professionals with transplant expertise. The workshop generated seven major themes of discussion: reinforcing the paramount importance of graft outcomes, reflecting critical tradeoffs (between graft health and complications of immunosuppression), contextualizing mortality, imperative to capture patient-reported outcomes, specificity to transplantation, feasibility and pragmatism, and recognizing gradients of severity. Participants agreed that measures such as graft health, mortality, cardiovascular disease, infection, cancer, and patient-reported outcomes (such as participation in life activities) should be included in a core outcome set. Recommendations from this workshop will be used moving forward to establish core outcome domains for trials in kidney transplantation.</p><p>Until a set of core outcomes has been formally established, clinicians and researchers interested in reporting and interpreting trial findings can access the Kidney Transplant Therapeutic Area Data Standards User Guide (TAUG-KT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], a guide that provides industry-standard definitions, outcomes, and results reporting for kidney transplantation research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY ENDPOINTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute rejection, which may be variably defined as presumptive rejection, clinical rejection (treated, but not biopsy proven), or biopsy-proven rejection, has been the primary endpoint in most immunosuppressive drug trials. Thus, the definition of acute rejection must be clearly defined in the study, and the timing and treatment of such rejection episodes must be reported. As an example, one generally accepted definition of acute rejection is an increase in serum creatinine of at least 15 percent above the baseline, in conjunction with histologic evidence of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. How reversal of rejection is defined in the study should also be clearly established. In addition, both biopsy-proven and clinical rejection frequencies should be reported to facilitate the comparison of results to other trials and the application of results to individual centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Existing regimens are associated with an incidence of acute rejection of less than 15 to 20 percent, decreased severity of the rejection, and a delay in the onset of acute rejection to beyond six months posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/4,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-15</a>]. Biopsy-proven acute rejection at 12 months has become recognized as one of the minimal criteria for endpoint determination and comparison. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since acute rejection rates with existing immunosuppression are so low, it is difficult to design trials in which enough patients obtain the statistical power needed to evaluate the outcome of interest. Various investigators have therefore recommended alternative and secondary endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. These include assessment of renal allograft function using biomarkers such as serum creatinine concentration, creatinine clearance, and cystatin C levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,51,52</a>]. Other endpoints to help predict allograft survival are under investigation with no definitive targets at this time. Potential surrogates include the use of renal allograft histology to determine the incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy, either through clinically indicated biopsy or on protocol surveillance biopsy; assessment of either immune activation or host accommodation; blood and urine immune markers or anti-donor specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies; and the toxicities of immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, many of these surrogate markers are unproven, cost prohibitive, and lack adequate sensitivity and specificity for use in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,53</a>]. In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a public workshop entitled Surrogate Endpoints for Clinical Trials in Kidney Transplantation.</p><p>Patient and allograft survival rates and the incidence of acute rejection remain the primary efficacy endpoints and the standard outcome needed to assess new immunosuppressant agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. It is necessary, however, that these endpoints be correlated with proven surrogate endpoints of long-term graft function in future clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Thus, evaluation of composite endpoints has become more frequent. Composite endpoints were introduced to alleviate issues associated with the use of one single, primary endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Composite endpoints commonly used in renal transplant trials include a combination of the traditional endpoints (survival rates and acute rejection rates) or a combination of traditional endpoints with surrogate endpoints (such as renal function, histological findings, or markers of immune activation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Although the use of multiple event composite endpoints to increase the overall event rate may result in a properly powered study, it requires a deeper analysis of the study results. This deeper analysis may require more specific and precise evaluation of the components of the composite endpoint with regards to timing of the event and the physiologic process.&nbsp;In some cases, one component of the composite may be driving the observed statistical significance. In this case, broad application of these results should warrant scrutiny when applying these interventions to a different patient population.&nbsp;It is necessary to evaluate each individual outcome within the composite to allow scientific conclusions to be appropriately drawn from the research and applied to a specific patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBGROUP ANALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subgroup analyses should be built into the study design prior to performance of the study to avoid the introduction of systematic bias. Even with proper design, definitive conclusions from subgroup analysis often cannot be made due to the small sample size of these clinical studies. However, if the treatment effect is substantial, then a subgroup analysis may be clinically relevant. Careful consideration of the statistical analysis must be used by both the investigator and reader to ensure appropriate interpretation of study results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-HOC ANALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several investigators use post-hoc analysis to generate new hypotheses. A significant bias may exist unless these analyses are defined a priori [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Reporting of such analyses must clearly be defined as retrospective and include a description of the statistical analysis used to mitigate bias in the methods of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Statistical limitations in post-hoc analyses, however, should not underscore the importance of reporting clinically relevant endpoints necessary to ensure appropriate application of results, with the caveat that most studies are underpowered to detect differences in secondary endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trials should focus on the incidence and severity of relevant adverse events. Useful parameters for evaluating &quot;over&quot; immunosuppression include the incidence of opportunistic infection and malignancy, such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Other common concerns are the incidence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and gastrointestinal toxicities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia and the renal transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effects of adverse events upon cardiac function and adverse cardiovascular outcomes have also gained importance. There has been an increasing shift to allograft loss because of death, rather than the loss of an allograft secondary to loss function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Each immunosuppressive agent has its own, unique adverse events profile. When combinations are used, adverse events may be exaggerated when the toxicity profiles are similar, or may be attenuated when lower doses of each agent are used.</p><p>Reporting of the incidence and listed rationale for participant withdrawal from clinical studies may also serve as an indirect indicator of the adverse event profile of an agent or regimen. Investigators should exercise caution when choosing the definition used to assess the incidence and severity of adverse effects in order to maintain endpoint generalizability and validity.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a clinical endpoint as &quot;how a patients feels, functions, or survives.&quot; Thus, outcomes such as a reduction in diabetes or patient-reported outcomes (such as quality of life or gastrointestinal toxicity) theoretically qualify as traditional (not surrogate) endpoints for drug-approval trials. A regulatory pathway for patient-reported outcomes as clinical trial endpoints exists, but it has been difficult to transition the regulatory guidance into meaningful changes in product labeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In 2016 the US FDA conducted a public meeting to gather information for patient-focused drug development in transplantation as a first step toward identifying significant patient-reported outcomes in transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">REPORTING RESEARCH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) have been proposed by investigators and editors to improve the quality and standardize the reporting of clinical trial results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. The goal of these standards is to permit the reader to assess the validity of study results and compare results between trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>When the quality of publications of large, multicenter clinical trials evaluating the immunosuppressive regimens in de novo renal transplant recipients was assessed, there were considerable deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Specifically, flaws in study design and publication reporting were identified, including a lack of follow-up beyond the first 12 months posttransplantation. In addition, failure to delineate criteria used for the diagnosis of acute rejection and failure to describe use of censoring in reported graft survival rates were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>].</p><p>Recommendations outlining the appropriate reporting of and assessment of multivariate regression analyses in the transplant literature have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This publication highlights the importance of reporting the modeling procedures as well as statistical tests to evaluate the validity of the model. Although the appropriate procedures are often performed, they are not often reported secondary to lack of space, making appendices appropriate.</p><p>Researchers and clinicians are urged to use CONSORT guidelines in the reporting and interpretation of clinical trial results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/43,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,59,60</a>]. Individual editorial boards are calling for adherence and use of these guidelines. Inability to provide the full description of trial protocols and analysis may influence publication of trial results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. With the call for reporting uniformity, transplant clinicians must also urge the professional organizations and editorial boards to encourage the capture of all outcome-related data. Limited funding in all research areas and small sample sizes halt reporting of non-statistically significant outcomes; however, to uncover clinically relevant applications, these data should be made available for pooled analysis, even when results are negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the different combinations of immunosuppressive agents, the ability to identify the optimal immunosuppressive regimen for a given individual remains unclear. In addition, lower acute rejection rates secondary to improved immunosuppression, trial outcome measures have also evolved, making individual trial results difficult to compare. To combat this difficulty, a critical, systematic, and scientific method for evaluating ongoing results from clinical trials is needed. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When extrapolating results from clinical trials to the individual transplant recipient or transplant center, clinicians must consider a large number of patient- and regimen-specific factors. These can affect clinical outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Patient population'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparable immunosuppressive regimens should be used in treatment and control groups (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive regimen'</a> above). Acute rejection has been the primary endpoint in most immunosuppressive drug trials. However, since current acute rejection rates with current immunosuppression are so low, alternative and secondary endpoints have been recommended. These include the assessment of a variety of biomarkers and surrogate measures. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy endpoints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subgroup and post-hoc analyses have been performed on trials evaluating kidney transplantation outcomes. There are major limitations with these types of analyses; however, they may provide novel hypotheses. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Subgroup analysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Post-hoc analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Useful parameters for evaluating adverse events in patients administered immunosuppressive agents include the incidence of opportunistic infection and malignancy, such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Other common concerns are the incidence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and gastrointestinal toxicities. Incorporation of patient-reported outcome measures into transplant clinical trials is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) have been proposed by investigators and editors to improve the quality and to standardize the reporting of clinical trial results. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Reporting research'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine-and-clinical-trials-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cyclosporin in cadaveric renal transplantation: one-year follow-up of a multicentre trial.
