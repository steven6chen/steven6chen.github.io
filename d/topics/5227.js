The psychological complications generally take the form of adjustment disorder, depressed mood, anxiety, impoverished life satisfaction, or loss of self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Patients most at risk for depression and other psychiatric illness have advanced disease, a prior psychiatric history, poorly controlled pain, and other life stressors or losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>In addition to these psychiatric conditions, non-specific distress is very common in cancer patients, with a reported incidence varying from 15 to 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Distress is the summation of multiple psychological, social, and spiritual factors. If severe enough, distress can interfere with the patient's ability to deal effectively with the illness, its symptoms, and the complications of treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has recommended routine screening of all cancer patients for psychological distress and simple instruments are available to measure distress in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Making psychiatric diagnoses and rapidly identifying patients who need help are difficult for many reasons. One problem is that psychiatric symptomatology may be mimicked by treatment side effects or symptoms of the cancer. Time factors and patient reluctance to discuss psychosocial problems can also act as barriers to the recognition of psychosocial problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Specific issues regarding the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer are reviewed here. The management of cancer patients with these problems is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.) Further information on specific psychiatric disorders is available in separate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUSTMENT DISORDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjustment disorder is the most prevalent psychiatric problem associated with cancer. It is evident in 20 to 30 percent of all such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>].</p><p>Adjustment disorder is characterized by a variety of clinically significant behavioral or emotional symptoms occurring as a result of a triggering event or stressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It may be associated with the following subtypes: depressed mood, anxiety, disturbance of conduct, mixed anxiety and depressed mood, and mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The onset of adjustment disorder must occur within three months of the triggering event and by definition does not endure past six months of the termination of the stressor or its consequences. However, the disorder may become chronic (lasting more than six months) when there is a chronic stressor or when the consequences of the stressor have long-term impact (as is often the case for people with cancer). Adjustment disorder can only be diagnosed if the disturbance does not meet the criteria for other disorders such as major depression or generalized anxiety disorder, is unique and not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder, and if the symptoms are not the result of normal bereavement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The identification and diagnosis of adjustment disorder is not straightforward. One of the difficulties is that the disorder lacks precise features; it is a function rather than symptom-based diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, there are no set criteria for quantifying the stressors that lead to adjustment disorder in a given individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Finally, it is often difficult to define what constitutes &quot;maladaptive behavior&quot; in response to catastrophic levels of stress, and the severity of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrement in social function vary widely within a given individual over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is important since these patients generally benefit from some form of counseling. Rapid identification of adjustment disorder can prompt early psychological intervention that enhances the patient's quality of life or, at the very least, prevents further erosion of his or her ability to function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depressive disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106958\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106958 \">table 2</a>) are a common complication of cancer. As an example, a national registry study of cancer patients (n &gt;21,000) found that the point prevalence of major depression for various primary sites (eg, breast, lung, or colorectal) ranged from 6 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) can mitigate its negative impact on quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, depression may contribute to shortened survival in those diagnosed with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], as well as increasing the risk of developing cancer in some people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although the physiologic basis for the increased mortality is not understood, this effect may be mediated by an alteration in the cellular immune response and a decrease in natural killer cell activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].</p><p>The reported prevalence of major depression in individuals with cancer varies widely, with reports ranging from 0 to 38 percent, and minor depression is present in additional patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This wide variability is explained by use of different diagnostic criteria, differences in patient populations (ie, demographics, type and stage of disease, treatment versus no treatment), and variation in assessment methods. In general, rates are higher in populations with advanced cancer, greater levels of disability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unrelieved pain.</p><p>Factors that may be associated with an increased risk of depression include younger age (eg, &lt;50 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], a prior history of depression, and the presence of uncontrolled symptoms from the cancer. In addition, certain types of malignancies appear to be associated with an increased incidence of depression, including cancers of the head and neck, pancreas, breast, and lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>There is a common presumption that all people with cancer are and should be depressed. This notion minimizes the degree of suffering that can be associated with comorbid depression and its impact upon quality of life. Health professionals may underestimate the morbidity caused by depression because they believe that they would feel depressed if roles were reversed. This view also promotes the underdiagnosis of depression and in turn, its undertreatment. Low-income and minority patients may be at particular risk, because they are less likely to receive routine screening and support for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Depressive states exist on a continuum from subsyndromal symptoms to the syndromes of minor depression and major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is important that physicians differentiate between normal sadness and abnormal levels of distress. Using screening tools and raising awareness about depression is an important step. Several studies have suggested that physicians and nurses do not recognize levels of depressive symptoms; this failure is worse when patients have more severe depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology has issued recommendations for the assessment and diagnosis of depression in patients with cancer, based upon practice guidelines from the Pan-Canadian Guideline on Screening, Assessment and Care of Psychosocial Distress (Depression, Anxiety) in Adults with Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The recommendations state that every patient with cancer should be screened for depression when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in cancer or treatment status (eg, posttreatment, recurrence, or progression), as well as transition to palliative care. The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663 \">table 3</a>) can be used to screen for depression. Patients who screen positive (a single &ldquo;yes&rdquo; response) should be interviewed to diagnose depression; the interview can be facilitated with the PHQ-9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 4</a>). Additional information about screening for depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another method to open a dialogue with the patient who might otherwise resist discussions of emotional issues is by asking about specific somatic symptoms. Symptoms of depression in physically healthy patients include somatic symptoms such as decreased appetite, loss of energy, insomnia, decreased libido, and psychomotor retardation. </p><p>However, in patients with cancer these physical symptoms must be carefully evaluated to clarify their etiology. Although neurovegetative symptoms are very compelling when present in the absence of physical illness, they are less reliable as diagnostic criteria for depression in patients with cancer since they can be caused by the cancer itself or its treatment. Loss of appetite due to chemotherapy, fatigue due to cancer or its treatment, and lack of sleep because of unrelieved pain are examples of the problems encountered in differentiating somatic symptoms that are due to depression or other medical causes. If certain physical symptoms are attributable to depression, antidepressants may be chosen to target the physical symptoms that are most distressing to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Certain drugs used in the treatment of cancer, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> also cause depressive symptoms that may be confused with adjustment disorder or mood disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Such confounding of the diagnosis can lead to improper treatment offered to patients, or may cause depression to be overlooked as a drug side effect.</p><p>Persistently depressed mood and sadness are appropriate responses for patients with a life-threatening disease. Thus, the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients, especially those who have advanced disease, relies more upon the other psychologic or &quot;cognitive symptoms.&quot;</p><p>Anhedonia, the lack of ability to experience pleasure, is a useful depressive symptom to monitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who are not depressed may be sad periodically, but maintain the capacity for experiencing pleasure. They react positively to opportunities to engage in the activities that they enjoy, even though the range of activities available to them may be diminished. There is nothing inherent to the disease or treatment process that robs one of the capacity to feel pleasure. Some patients with far advanced disease experience heightened pleasure in intimacies with family or friends knowing that the experiences are among the last they might have; the knowledge that death is near can increase the poignancy and emotion of such contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, excessive guilt, loss of self-esteem, and wishes to die are also among the most diagnostically reliable symptoms of depression in cancer patients. However, interpretation of even these symptoms can be difficult. As an example, feelings of hopelessness in dying patients who have no hope for recovery can be normal. On the other hand, many patients who never have a hope of a cure are able to maintain hope that life can be extended, symptoms can be controlled, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quality of life can be maintained. Hopelessness that is pervasive and accompanied by a sense of despair or despondency is more likely to represent a symptom of a depressive disorder. Additional information about assessing patients for depression in the context of general medical illnesses is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H611997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'General medical illness'</a>.)</p><p>Patients often state that they feel they are burdening their families unfairly, causing them great pain and inconvenience. Such beliefs are less likely to represent symptoms of depression than if the patient suffers with guilty recrimination, feels that their life has never had any worth, or that they are being punished for evil things they have done.</p><p>The perception of being a burden to others can sometimes be altered by counseling and helping the patient to reframe the situation as a necessary component of the mourning process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The patient can come to see that allowing him or herself to be cared for is important for their family's sake.</p><p>Additional information about diagnosing depression in patients receiving palliative care as well as diagnosing major depression and minor depression in the general population is discussed separately.

Evidence for an elevated risk of suicide in patients with cancer comes from observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study using multiple registries examined the risk of suicide in more than 6,000,000 Swedes from 1991 through 2006; compared with cancer-free individuals, patients diagnosed with cancer were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>13 times more likely to commit suicide within one week of receiving the diagnosis (RR 12.6, 95% CI 8.6-17.8)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3 times more likely within one year (RR 3.1, 95% CI 2.7-3.5)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Risk of suicide was especially high in patients with poor prognosis cancers (eg, lung, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of over 500,000 Danish cancer patients diagnosed between 1971 and 1999 found that the rate of suicide among male patients was 70 percent greater than that in the general population, and 40 percent greater in female patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] </p><p/><p>Depression near the end of life may cause the patient to seek assistance in shortening life, which is discussed separately.

Thus, the recognition of anxiety symptoms requiring treatment can be challenging.</p><p>Patients with anxiety complain of tension or restlessness, or they exhibit jitteriness, autonomic hyperactivity, vigilance, insomnia, distractibility, shortness of breath, numbness, apprehension, worry or rumination.

These symptoms are a cue to further inquiry about the patient's psychological state, which is commonly one of fear, worry, or apprehension.</p><p>Anxiety can have many etiologies in patients with cancer. It may be encountered as a component of an adjustment disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, phobia, or agitated depression. In the patient with advanced disease, symptoms of anxiety are most likely to arise from a medical complication of the illness or treatment such as organic anxiety disorder, delirium, or other organic mental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Hypoxia, sepsis, poorly controlled pain, and adverse drug reactions such as akathisia, or withdrawal states often present as anxiety. Benzodiazepine withdrawal also can present first as agitation or anxiety; this diagnosis is often missed in patients with advanced disease, especially the elderly, since physiologic dependence on these medications is often unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Psychological factors also often cause anxiety, particularly in patients who are alert and not confused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients frequently fear isolation, estrangement from others, and may have a general sense of feeling like an outcast. Financial burdens and family role changes are other common stressors.</p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology has issued recommendations for the assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in patients with cancer, based upon practice guidelines from the Pan-Canadian Guideline on Screening, Assessment and Care of Psychosocial Distress (Depression, Anxiety) in Adults with Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The recommendations state that every patient with cancer should be screened for anxiety when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in cancer or treatment status (eg, posttreatment, recurrence, or progression), as well as transition to palliative care. The seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77755 \">table 5</a>) can be used for screening.

In contrast to dementia, delirium is a reversible process.</p><p>Delirium is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric complications in patients with advanced cancer, and it causes moderate to severe distress in both patient and caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The incidence ranges from 15 to 75 percent, depending on the clinical setting. For instance, among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, 15 to 20 percent have organic mental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

As an example, given the large numbers of drugs cancer patients require and the fragile state of their physiologic functioning, even routinely ordered hypnotics and opioids can cause an organic mental syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapeutic agents known to cause delirium include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, BCNU, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, asparaginase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, and biological response modifiers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-58</a>]. However, with the exception of corticosteroids and biological response modifiers, most patients who receive these drugs will not develop prominent CNS effects.</p><p>The spectrum of mental disturbances related to corticosteroids includes minor mood lability, affective disorders (mania or depression), cognitive impairment (reversible dementia), and delirium (steroid psychosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of these disorders range from 3 to 57 percent in noncancer populations, most commonly occurring at higher doses. Symptoms usually develop within the first two weeks of treatment, although they can occur at any time and on any dose, even during the tapering phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Prior psychiatric illness, or prior disturbance on corticosteroids are poor to fair predictors of susceptibility to, or the nature of, mental disturbances during subsequent steroid treatments. These disorders are often rapidly reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation.</p><p>Early symptoms of delirium may be misdiagnosed as anxiety, anger, depression, psychosis, or unreasonable or uncooperative attitudes toward rehabilitative efforts or other treatments. The diagnosis should be considered in any patient with the acute onset of agitation, impaired cognitive function, altered attention span, or a fluctuating level of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Instruments are being developed to facilitate the diagnosis of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>It can be difficult to differentiate delirium from dementia since they frequently share such common clinical features such as impaired memory, thinking, judgment, and disorientation. Dementia occurs in relatively alert individuals with little or no clouding of consciousness. The temporal onset of symptoms in dementia is more insidious or chronically progressive, and the patient's sleep-wake cycle is generally not impaired. Most prominent in dementia are difficulties in short and long term memory, impaired judgment and abstract thinking, and disturbed higher cortical functions (eg, aphasia, apraxia). Occasionally one will encounter delirium superimposed on an underlying dementia, particularly in the elderly, a patient with AIDS, or one with a paraneoplastic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjustment disorder occurs in 20 to 30 percent of patients with cancer. In adjustment disorder, a triggering event or stressor leads to depressed mood, anxiety, or disturbance of conduct within three months; the disorder ends six months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased. However, the disorder may last more than six months if the stressor is chronic. Adjustment disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms meet criteria for other disorders such as major depression or generalized anxiety disorder, or the symptoms are due to bereavement. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Adjustment disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated prevalence of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) in cancer patients varies from 0 to 38 percent. The prevalence may be underestimated because of the notion that cancer patients are and should be depressed. The rate of depression is generally higher in patients with advanced cancer, greater disability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unrelieved pain. Other risk factors include young age, a prior history of depression, and the presence of uncontrolled cancer symptoms, as well as specific types of malignancies, including head and neck, pancreas, breast, and lung cancer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians are encouraged to screen every patient with cancer for depression when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated; the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663 \">table 3</a>) can be used. The diagnosis of depression in cancer patients, especially those who have advanced disease, relies primarily upon the symptoms of anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure), hopelessness, worthlessness, excessive guilt, and wishes to die. Symptoms such as anorexia, anergia, insomnia, decreased libido, and psychomotor retardation may be caused by cancer rather than major depression. In addition, drugs used to treat cancer (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>) can cause symptoms that are similar to depressive symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of completed suicide in patients with cancer is elevated in both men and women. In addition, depression near the end of life may cause the patient to seek assistance in shortening life.

Cancer patients may have a number of anxiety symptoms (eg, tension, restlessness, jitteriness, autonomic hyperactivity, vigilance, insomnia, distractibility, shortness of breath, numbness, apprehension, worry, and rumination) and anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and phobia). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anxiety'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H191515190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H19509096\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific phobia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delirium is characterized by a disturbance of consciousness (reduced awareness of the environment) and impaired attention, and occurs in 15 to 75 percent of patients with advanced cancer (depending upon the clinical setting). The etiology typically involves the direct effects of cancer upon the central nervous system (CNS), the indirect CNS effects of cancer or treatments (eg, medications, electrolyte imbalance, failure of a vital organ, infection, and vascular complications), and preexisting cognitive impairment or dementia.
