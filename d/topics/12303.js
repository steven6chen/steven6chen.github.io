Although it is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men after lung and colon cancer in the United States, cancer-specific survival is excellent for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Due to a generally older age at presentation, earlier detection, effective treatment, and a protracted clinical course for most men, prostate cancer survivors have a higher risk of death from non-cancer causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In the United States alone, over three million men are survivors of prostate cancer, comprising 43 percent of the total United States male cancer survivor population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is estimated that by 2024, prostate cancer survivors will exceed four million in number, highlighting the importance of collaboration between primary care providers and cancer specialists so that these patients' unique needs can be met efficiently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to prostate cancer survivors and is focused on patients seen in a coordinated care setting between their primary care and oncology providers or those exclusively cared for by their primary care providers. For purposes of this discussion, cancer survivors are characterized as men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have completed all treatment for prostate cancer. The approach presented in this topic is consistent with guidelines from the American Cancer Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Further information on the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of prostate cancer is discussed separately.

In the remainder of patients, the diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms of advanced cancer (eg, urinary tract obstruction, hematuria, bone pain). Regardless of clinical suspicion, the diagnosis of prostate cancer requires histologic confirmation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For most men suspected of having prostate cancer, tissue is obtained through an in-office transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy during which 12 biopsy cores are taken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Targeted biopsy in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or more than 12 biopsies (&quot;saturation biopsies&quot;) may be indicated if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prostate gland is significantly enlarged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician feels it is required to accurately characterize the extent of the prostate involvement, especially for patients considering active surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the prior biopsies were negative, but a high index of suspicion for prostate cancer remains (eg, persistent rising PSA). </p><p/><p>Based on the architectural growth pattern and degree of differentiation noted in the biopsy specimens, tumors are graded from best to worse on a scale from 3 to 5, respectively, and the scores from the two most prevalent differentiation patterns are added to comprise the Gleason score. The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) consensus conference adopted a new grading system based upon the modified Gleason scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this system, tumors are separated into five grade groups based upon the primary and secondary Gleason patterns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of prostate biopsy&quot;, section on 'Gleason grading system'</a>.)</p><p>The standard staging system for newly diagnosed prostate cancer is the eighth (2017) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) cancer staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 3</a>). This system incorporates the anatomic extent of disease, including the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M), as well as the pretreatment serum PSA and histologic grade group (based upon the Gleason score) to divide patients into prognostic stage groups based on their risk for disease progression to biochemical recurrence and potentially fatal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Definitive treatment is initiated if there is evidence of progression or increased risk of progression. Because these patients are at a low risk of disease progression, active surveillance potentially spares them the side effects of definitive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

Watchful waiting now is used to describe the approach to patients with a limited life expectancy (ie, &lt;5 years) who are not candidates for definitive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Accurately defining the appropriate patient population who are candidates for active surveillance is critical to maximize the benefits of active surveillance compared with immediate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1526937\"><span class=\"h3\">Radical prostatectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical prostatectomy is an option for men with a life expectancy of at least 10 years.

An early report of a phase III randomized trial comparing open radical prostatectomy with a minimally invasive robotic approach indicated no differences in functional (urinary, sexual) or pathological outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In general, the experience of the surgeon should be the critical factor in choosing an operative approach. In addition, a pelvic node dissection is often performed for men with a &ge;2 percent risk of nodal involvement.

RT, increasingly in fewer doses (hypofractionation), can be delivered as external beam RT or brachytherapy. In the United States, intensity-modulated RT is the most common form of external beam RT. Although proton beam and stereotactic radiotherapy are increasing in popularity, no benefit has been demonstrated with these approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, the optimal duration of treatment has not been definitively determined. There are no data to support its use in men who choose to proceed with a radical prostatectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer#H2956464\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Role of ADT'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged treatment has been shown to be beneficial for men with metastatic disease or symptomatic locally advanced disease not amenable to definitive treatment. Randomized trials indicate potential non-inferiority of intermittent versus continuous ADT with respect to survival outcomes and possible improved side effect profiles with an intermittent approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Regardless, men on ADT are generally followed by their oncology specialist (urologist or medical oncologist), although they may also be in continued follow-up with their primary care doctor. The approach and treatment options for these men are discussed separately.

Although more careful patient selection and advances in the modalities of treatment (eg, intensity-modulated radiation therapy [RT], improved techniques with open radical prostatectomy, robotic-assisted surgery) have limited the frequency of these side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], they continue to occur, even in contemporary series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As such, understanding these late and long-term toxicities is important because they can worsen quality of life (QOL) and adversely impact relationships with partners and caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/25,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31-33</a>].

The risk for cardiovascular toxicity may be particularly relevant to patients whose management includes androgen deprivation therapy (ADT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90233 \">table 4</a>)), even in the short term, although this association continues to be somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This may be due to the adverse effects of ADT on traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including lipoproteins, insulin sensitivity, and obesity. Whether or not ADT increases the cardiovascular toxicity, the potential benefits of ADT for men with prostate cancer appear to outweigh the risks when ADT is used for appropriate indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-of-androgen-deprivation-therapy#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Side effects of androgen deprivation therapy&quot;, section on 'Potential cardiovascular harm'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, a United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Medicare study involving over 73,000 men reported that ADT resulted in an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.21), coronary heart disease (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.26), and death (due to sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia, HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-prostate-cancer-survivors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Due to a combination of older age at diagnosis, early detection, effective treatments, and a protracted clinical course, prostate cancer survivors have a higher risk of death from non-cancer causes (eg, cardiac) than from the disease itself. (See <a href=\"#H182431111\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 90 percent of patients present with local or locoregional disease due to the widespread use of prostate cancer screening (ie, use of prostate-specific antigen [PSA] or digital rectal examination [DRE]). In the remainder of patients, the diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms of advanced cancer (eg, urinary tract obstruction, hematuria, bone pain). Regardless of clinical suspicion, the diagnosis of prostate cancer typically requires histologic confirmation. (See <a href=\"#H182431118\" class=\"local\">'Overview of prostate cancer management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men entering posttreatment follow-up, it is important for cancer specialists and primary care providers (PCPs) to clearly communicate who will take responsibility for the different aspects of cancer surveillance and the thresholds for referral back to specialty care. This may be done in the form of a treatment summary from the treating providers to primary care or even in the surveillance portion of a survivorship care plan. However, all clinicians involved in surveillance should refrain from duplicate evaluations (including PSA testing or DREs). (See <a href=\"#H462941819\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the prevention of cardiovascular disease relies on measures aimed at improving heart health.

Therefore, biopsychosocial support for patients and partners may be warranted, even among long-term couples.
