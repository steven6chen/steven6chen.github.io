These terms are commonly used to describe a woman who has or does not have the Rh(D) antigen on her red cells (RBCs). However, this abbreviated nomenclature is an artificial designation and can be confusing because the Rhesus blood group system consists of 48 antigens; the most common antigens to which individuals make antibodies are D (there is no d antigen), C, c, E, e; <span class=\"nowrap\">C/c</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">E/e</span> are alternate alleles with codominant expression. </p><p>Some combination of DCE is inherited as a haplotype from each parent.

In other phenotypically Rh(D)-negative ethnic groups, the gene may be present but not translated or expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Variants in the Rhesus system appear to be more common in the African American population, particularly at the D and e loci. The Rh(D)-negative phenotype in Africans is often the result of genes&nbsp;that contain sequences coding for Rh(D) but do not produce the complete Rh(D) antigen (ie, <em>RHD</em> pseudogene). The frequency of these gene distributions differs between black&nbsp;Africans, African Americans, and black South Africans. An <em>RHD</em> pseudogene has been described in 69 percent of South African blacks and 21 percent of African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Other unexpressed <em>RHD</em> gene variations have been observed in 12 percent of Japanese individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These individuals have the entire <em>RHD</em> gene on their chromosomes, but are Rh(D)-negative on serologic testing, and their red cells are not affected by anti-D antibody in vivo.</p><p>Depending on the reagent employed, some patients undergoing Rh(D) typing will reveal a &quot;weak D&quot; expression on initial testing. When the patient's red cells are tested with an anti-D reagent, they react with no or a &lt;2+ reaction; when anti-human globulin is added, a moderate to strong reaction occurs. These patients are called &quot;&ldquo;serologic weak D phenotype&quot; (formerly &quot;D<sup>u</sup> positive&quot;). The two major explanations for this finding are either a decreased number of intact Rh(D) antigens on the surface of the red cells (&ldquo;weak D type&rdquo;) or Rh(D) antigens that are missing a portion, called epitopes, (&ldquo;partial D phenotype&rdquo;). </p><p>An estimated 0.2 to 1.0 percent of Caucasians inherit <em>RHD</em> genes associated with the serologic weak D phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although more than 200 mutations have been associated with alterations in the expression of the Rh(D) antigen, the majority of weak D phenotypes will be types 1, 2, or 3. Patients with these three types that receive Rh(D) positive red cells do not become alloimmunized to Rh(D). Other types of Rh variants can, however, form anti-D when exposed to the intact Rh(D) antigen.</p><p>Problems arise when a patient has undergone testing in one laboratory (using a sensitive reagent that detects the weak D phenotype) that reveals an Rh(D) positive result and then a second laboratory reports a Rh(D) negative result. This may occur when the patient is being considered as a blood donor and then is tested again later in a pregnancy. In the United States, the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) guideline for blood banks does not require that a test for weak D or variant D be performed on Rh(D)-negative pregnant patients. These patients will be considered Rh(D)-negative and receive anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. </p><p>A working group with representatives from the blood banking and obstetrical community recommends that when discrepant Rh(D) typing is noted or a weak D type is detected, the patient should undergo <em>RHD</em> genotyping for weak D types. If she is type 1, 2 or 3, she can be considered Rh(D) positive and anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> is not indicated. This would avert the need of almost 25,000 units of anti-D immune globulin being administered to 13,000 pregnant women. In addition, more than 47,000 units of Rh(D)-negative red cells (a rare commodity in the blood supply) would not be transfused to these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If the patient is genotyped and weak D types 1, 2, or 3 are not found, then the patient is managed as Rh(D) negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy#H3058657131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Rhesus (D) alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Weak D or discordant D typing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368020454\"><span class=\"h2\">Rh(G)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A change of a single amino acid in the extramembranous portion of both the Rh(D) and Rh(C) proteins results in the expression of the Rh(G) phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The majority of patients who are Rh(D) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Rh(C) positive are also Rh(G) positive; if both Rh(D) and Rh(C) are absent, Rh(G) is also absent. Patients who lack all three antigens can become alloimmunized to the Rh(C) and Rh(G) antigen while not developing antibodies to Rh(D). </p><p>When an Rh(D)-negative pregnant woman appears to have both anti-D and anti-C, the laboratory must determine whether the antibody is really anti-D or actually anti-G because a pregnant woman who develops anti-C and anti-G antibodies but no anti-D is still a candidate for anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. </p><p>Anti-G is usually found in combination with anti-D, anti-C, or both, and thus its significance in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn is difficult to quantify.

Maternal Rh(D) alloimmunization develops as a result of maternal immune system exposure to Rh(D)-positive RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Once anti-D IgG antibodies are present in the pregnant woman's circulation, they can cross the placenta and opsonize fetal RBCs, which are then phagocytized by macrophages in the fetal spleen. </p><p>Events that can cause maternal alloimmunization include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplacental fetomaternal hemorrhage during any pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55779 \">table 1</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection with needles contaminated by Rh(D)-positive blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadvertent transfusion of Rh(D)-positive blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p/><p>Transplacental fetomaternal bleeding accounts for virtually all cases of maternal Rh(D) alloimmunization. Tiny (0.1 mL) quantities of fetal RBCs gain access to the maternal circulation in nearly all pregnancies, as demonstrated by studies using flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The frequency and volume of spontaneous fetomaternal hemorrhage increase with advancing gestational age and are highest at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Fetomaternal hemorrhage can also be associated with miscarriage, pregnancy termination, ectopic pregnancy, invasive in-utero procedures, fetal death, maternal abdominal trauma, antepartum maternal hemorrhage, and external cephalic version. Early predictors of fetomaternal hemorrhage remain largely unknown, and no cause of hemorrhage can be identified in over 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Of note, there are six reports of alloantibodies to Rh(D) antigen without identifiable maternal exposure to red cells carrying the D antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These cases may be the result of early pregnancy losses (including vanishing twins) that were not clinically recognized. Alternatively, a &quot;grandmother theory&quot; has been proposed as the etiology. In these cases, Rh(D) positive red cells from the patient's mother gain access to the fetal circulation at birth (maternal-fetal hemorrhage). The Rh(D) negative neonate then forms a low level of antibody to these Rh(D) positive cells.</p><p>Although the Rh(D) antigen is thought to elicit a strong immune response, the response varies considerably among individuals. As an example, studies in male Rh(D)-negative prisoners showed that intravenous injection of as little as 0.1 mL of Rh(D)-positive RBCs was sufficient to immunize some individuals, while 30 percent of the Rh(D)-negative men did not become sensitized despite two injections (first 10 mL, then 5 mL) of Rh(D)-positive blood over a six-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The percentage of Rh(D)-negative individuals developing an immune response to infusion of Rh(D)-positive RBCs depends, in part, on the volume of blood infused: 0.5 mL RBCs stimulates an anti-D response in some subjects, whereas one unit (450 mL) of RBCs results in the maximum percentage of responders (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The antibody response develops slowly, and is usually not detectable serologically until 5 to 15 weeks after exposure. Whether a primary immune response occurs depends upon several factors besides the volume of fetal blood to which the mother was exposed. These variables include the frequency of fetomaternal transfusion and whether the mother and fetus are ABO compatible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Both the immunogenicity of the fetal RBCs and the immunogenic response capacity of the mother play a role in pathogenesis. Interestingly, individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as well as some other patient populations, may not form alloantibodies to the D antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Transplacental transfer of maternal antibody leads to hemolytic disease of the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/newborn</span>. The severity of fetal anemia is influenced primarily by antibody concentration, but also by additional factors that are not fully understood. These include the subclass and glycosylation of maternal antibodies; the structure, site density, maturational development and tissue distribution of blood group antigens; the efficiency of transplacental IgG transport; the functional maturity of the fetal spleen; polymorphisms which affect Fc receptor function; and the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related inhibitory antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

For Rh(D)-negative women with an initially negative antibody screen and uncomplicated pregnancy, the antibody screen is repeated at 28 weeks of gestation, and at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. A positive alloantibody identification should be interpreted as a screening test, just as serum alpha-fetoprotein is a screening test for the detection of fetal neural tube defects. A positive alloantibody identification means that the fetus is at risk for hemolytic disease, not that it has occurred or will develop.</p><p>The test most commonly used for diagnostic purposes is the indirect Coombs test (ie, determination of antibodies in the plasma), which is the most accurate technique for determining antibody titers. The indirect Coombs titer is the value used to guide obstetrical management of alloimmunized pregnancies.</p><p>Incubation of known Rh(D)-positive red blood cells (RBCs) with maternal plasma is the first step in the indirect Coombs test. Any anti-Rh(D) antibody present will adhere to the RBCs. The RBCs are then washed and suspended in antihuman globulin (Coombs) serum. Red cells coated with maternal anti-Rh(D) will be agglutinated by the antihuman globulin, which is referred to as a positive indirect Coombs test.</p><p>The gel microcolumn assay (GMA) card is a promising alternative to traditional tube agglutination tests for determining anti-D antibody titers. Advantages of GMA over tube tests include: it is less susceptible to inter-laboratory and intra-laboratory sources of variability, yields clear objective results that are stable, takes less time, and is compatible with automation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, GMA may yield higher titer values compared to tube tests. In several studies, the increase was usually only one or two dilutions, which is not clinically significant (a fourfold difference is clinically significant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], but some studies reported greater discordancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. More data are needed to establish the correlation between GMA titer and severity of fetal anemia before this assay can be used to manage alloimmunization in pregnancy. For this reason, standard tube titers should still be used for clinical management of the alloimmunized pregnancy. </p><p>Use of automated enzymatic methods for screening for anti-Rh(D) antibodies is not recommended. These techniques are less accurate than manual methods and, in rare cases, detect clinically insignificant, naturally occurring Rh(D) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1425064072\"><span class=\"h2\">False positive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for anti-D antibodies may not be helpful in identifying alloimmunization if the patient has received anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> within the past few weeks. Titration can be helpful: women who received anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks will have a low (&le;4) antibody titer at term; a high titer suggests the presence of alloanti-D.

Alloimmune <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> anemia can be treated, but the only options for prevention of the disease are pregnancy by insemination with sperm from a Rh(D)-negative donor, preimplantation genetic diagnosis for selection of <em>RHD</em> negative embryos (if father is heterozygous for <em>RHD</em>), or use of a gestational surrogate. Given the success of intrauterine fetal transfusion, these options are usually considered only by women at risk for very early, severe fetal anemia where intrauterine fetal transfusion is more risky and less successful.

Variants include weak D and partial D antigens. In addition, the D gene may be present, but not translated or not expressed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The Rhesus system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal Rh(D) alloimmunization develops as a result of maternal immune system exposure to Rh(D)-positive red blood cells (RBCs). Maternal immunization can occur as a result of transplacental fetomaternal hemorrhage during any pregnancy, injection with needles contaminated by Rh(D)-positive blood, or inadvertent transfusion of Rh(D)-positive blood (including during transplantation). (See <a href=\"#H3571754\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and consequences of alloimmunization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Rh(D) alloimmunization is based upon detection of anti-Rh(D) antibody in maternal serum. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend performing Rh(D) typing and an antibody screen at the first prenatal visit. In Rh(D)-negative women, the antibody screen may be repeated at 28 weeks of gestation, and should be repeated at delivery. (See <a href=\"#H488456626\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When discrepant Rh(D) typing is noted or a weak D type is detected, the patient should undergo <em>RHD</em> genotyping for weak D types. If she is type 1, 2 or 3, she can be considered Rh(D) positive and anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> is not indicated.
