The superficial skin is less susceptible to pressure-induced damage than deeper tissues, and thus, the external appearance may underestimate the extent of damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lesions are typically related to immobility (ie, bed-bound or chair-bound individual) but can also result from poorly fitting casts or other medical equipment or devices. </p><p>The clinical staging that guides treatment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries and their management are reviewed here.

Risk factors are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76126129\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries are areas of localized damage to the skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underlying tissue, usually&nbsp;over a bony prominence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80206 \">figure 1</a>), as a result of pressure or pressure in combination with&nbsp;shear (eg, sacrum, calcaneus, ischium). These are usually clinically apparent on examination by the appearance of the skin and location. Superficial moisture-induced lesions, located over a bony prominence, should not be labeled as pressure injuries, and neither should skin tears, tape burns, perineal dermatitis, or excoriation.</p><p>Identified areas of skin damage should be evaluated for length, width, and depth; presence of sinus tracts, necrotic tissue, or exudate; and evidence for healing such as the presence of granulation. Photographs of all wounds are helpful. Based upon this information, the lesion can be staged. (See <a href=\"#H76128204\" class=\"local\">'NPUAP staging'</a> below.) </p><p>Infections impair wound healing. The possibility of infection should be considered even if systemic signs, such as fever and leukocytosis, are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infection of pressure injuries can present with local signs of soft tissue involvement, such as warmth, erythema, local tenderness, purulent discharge, and the presence of a foul odor. However, the manifestations of infection can be variable, with delayed wound healing as the only sign of infection. (See <a href=\"#H76129769\" class=\"local\">'Treat infection'</a> below.) </p><p>Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries can serve as a reservoir for resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and multiply-resistant gram-negative bacilli, and colonized or infected ulcers pose a potential risk to other hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Precautions should be used when examining and treating ulcers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;, section on 'Standard precautions'</a>.)</p><p>Other complications may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus tracts that communicate with the deep viscera, including the bowel or bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional heterotrophic calcification. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic amyloidosis due to the chronic inflammatory state arising from the ulcer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma.

The most commonly used system is from the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50125 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>NPUAP suggests using the terminology &quot;pressure injury&quot; to describe these wounds, given that lesser degrees of skin damage due to pressure may not be associated with skin ulceration. The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) recommends similar stages, except for the presence of suspected deep tissue injury and unstageable ulcers. (See <a href=\"#H1424764932\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>The wound should be staged according to its deepest extent. As an example, although the majority of a wound may be stage 2, any portion that extends deeper classifies the ulcer as a higher stage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76128204\"><span class=\"h3\">NPUAP staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) staging system is described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50125 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The NPUAP stage is used to describe the initial appearance of an area of skin damage. The practice of changing the stage as healing occurs, known as reverse staging, is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9368553\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage 1 is characterized by intact skin with a localized area of nonblanchable erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67475 \">picture 1</a>), which may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. The presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9368616\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage 2 is characterized by partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67475 \">picture 1</a>). The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough, and eschar are not present. </p><p>These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel.&nbsp;This stage should <strong>not</strong> be used to describe moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9368650\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage 3 is characterized by full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67475 \">picture 1</a>). Slough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant&nbsp;adiposity can develop deep wounds.&nbsp;Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss, this is an unstageable pressure injury.</p><p>The depth of a stage 3 pressure ulcer varies by anatomic location. Stage 3 ulcers can be shallow in areas without subcutaneous tissue, which include the bridge of the nose, ear, occiput, and the malleolus. By contrast, the gluteal region can develop very deep ulcers (stage 3, stage 4). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9368684\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage 4 is characterized by full-thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage, or bone in the ulcer. Slough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eschar may be visible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67475 \">picture 1</a>). Epibole (rolled edges), undermining, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss, this is an unstageable pressure injury. </p><p>The extent of stage 4 ulcers is often underestimated due to undermining and fistula formation; a relatively small superficial skin defect may mask extensive deep tissue necrosis. The depth of a stage 4 pressure ulcer also varies by anatomic location. As with stage 3 ulcers, the bridge of the nose, ear, occiput, and malleolus do not have subcutaneous tissue, and stage 4 ulcers in these locations can be shallow. Stage 4 ulcers that extend into supporting structures, including fascia, tendon, or joint capsule, may be associated with osteomyelitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76128234\"><span class=\"h4\">Unstageable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure-induced skin damage is considered unstageable when there is full-thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar.&nbsp;If slough or eschar is removed, a stage 3 or stage 4 pressure injury will be revealed. Stable eschar (ie, dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on an ischemic limb or the heel(s) should not be removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76128240\"><span class=\"h4\">Suspected deep tissue pressure injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;suspected deep tissue pressure injury&quot; stage captures the lingering debate on how best to identify lesions with intact overlying skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Deep tissue pressure injury should be suspected whenever there is a localized area of skin (intact or non-intact) with persistent nonblanchable deep red, maroon, or purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood-filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin.&nbsp;This level of skin injury results from intense <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle, or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full-thickness pressure injury (unstageable, stage 3 or stage 4). Do <strong>not</strong> use deep tissue pressure injury to describe vascular, traumatic, neuropathic, or dermatologic conditions.</p><p>Deep tissue pressure injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. The area may be painful, firm or spongy, boggy, warm, or cool compared with the surrounding tissue.

This results in lifestyle changes leading to social isolation, depression, and reduced health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Control pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate pain relief should be provided as pressure-induced injuries can be quite painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Local factors that may be contributing to pain such as ischemia, infection, or breakdown of the surrounding skin should be addressed. </p><p>Initial and ongoing pain assessment should be documented using a pain scale. Assessment is aimed at identifying the type and extent of pain present so that appropriate therapy may be provided. Pain may be classified as intermittent, which occurs at the time of wound debridement, or cyclic, which occurs at the time of a dressing change, or as persistent pain occurring all the time. </p><p>Oral nonopioid pain medications can be used for mild pain.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Wound management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dressings are selected based on wound characteristics, including the presence of heavy exudate, desiccation, or necrotic tissue. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Wound dressings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotic tissue promotes bacterial growth and impairs wound healing. Wound debridement approaches include irrigation, surgical debridement, enzymatic debridement, and biologic debridement. (See <a href=\"#H454556281\" class=\"local\">'Debridement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are successfully managed without surgery; procedures such as direct closure, skin grafts, musculocutaneous flaps, and free flaps may be appropriate in patients whose quality of life would be markedly improved by rapid wound coverage.
