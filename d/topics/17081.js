Difficulties frequently occur as the result of patient characteristics that interfere with spontaneous breathing, bag mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intubation of the trachea. Identifying characteristics of the difficult airway and developing a plan for managing problems are essential principles of anesthesia practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-difficult-pediatric-airway/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These principles have been modified and effectively used to evaluate adults in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-difficult-pediatric-airway/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Children infrequently require aggressive airway management and difficulties do not often occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-difficult-pediatric-airway/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Many of the difficult airway predictors, particularly anatomic abnormalities, are more common in adults.

In addition, children with underlying airway abnormalities who acquire an acute condition (such as croup or an upper respiratory tract infection) may quickly develop respiratory compromise. Congenital features that may interfere with airway management include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Misshapen head</strong> &ndash; Positioning of the head to optimally align the pharyngeal and tracheal axes may be difficult if the head is misshapen, as can occur with craniosynostosis (such as Apert's or Crouzon's syndrome) or macrocephaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=craniosynostosis-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Craniosynostosis syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facial abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Facial asymmetry or underdevelopment may make it difficult to achieve a good seal between the face and a mask, creating difficulties with bag mask ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57724 \">picture 3</a>). As examples, maxillary hypoplasia is a feature of Apert's syndrome, while Goldenhar syndrome includes unilateral hypoplasia of the mandible.

This may make laryngoscopy and control of oral structures difficult. For instance, mandibular hypoplasia is a feature of the Robin sequence and Treacher Collins' syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68928 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large tongue</strong> &ndash; A large tongue may obstruct the airway during bag mask ventilation or be difficult to control during laryngoscopy. Macroglossia occurs in several conditions (such as hypothyroidism, Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, and Down syndrome). It is also a feature of infiltrative diseases such as the mucopolysaccharidoses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Masses</strong> &ndash; Masses in the neck (such as cystic hygromas) may interfere with positioning. Masses within the airway (such as teratomas or hemangiomas) may obstruct the airway and interfere with visualization of the larynx.

A stylet with a fiberoptic light source is inserted into an endotracheal tube that is then blindly placed into the posterior pharynx and advanced. The tube is usually located in the trachea when a cherry-red glow is noted at the suprasternal notch. The stylet can then be carefully removed, endotracheal tube placement confirmed, and the tube secured. The major disadvantages of the lightwand technique include longer times to intubation and lower success rate for inexperienced users (fewer than 20 intubations using the device). Thus, for clinicians with limited opportunity to manage difficult pediatric airways, most experts would recommend use of a device which is easier to learn and use (eg, fiberoptic stylet).

With this technique an endotracheal tube is loaded onto a stylet with a fiberoptic lens that allows the clinician to visualize the glottis. The endotracheal tube is then threaded through the glottis and secured. The fiberoptic stylet is especially useful when standard laryngoscopy is difficult or impossible because the patient has limited mouth opening or neck mobility. It is also useful when the patient has certain anatomic abnormalities that make endotracheal intubation difficult (eg, small mandible, large tongue, very anterior airway). This device may be used in conjunction with the laryngeal mask airway.

Experience with this approach in the emergency department is almost exclusively in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-difficult-pediatric-airway/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Typically, an endotracheal tube is threaded onto the end of a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. The scope is then introduced into the nose or mouth. The trachea is visualized and intubated with the scope and endotracheal tube. The scope is then withdrawn, placement of the endotracheal tube in the trachea is confirmed, and the tube is secured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H13595755\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope'</a>.)</p><p>Fiberoptic intubation should be considered in cases where the pre-intubation assessment suggests that orotracheal intubation via RSI (preferred in most emergency department intubation scenarios) is unlikely to be successful. Examples include congenital airway anomalies such as micrognathia or conditions where difficulty aligning the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes is predicted (such as when neck mobility is limited). The small size of the nasal passages in very young children may preclude the nasal route for intubation.</p><p>In the hands of an experienced clinician, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy is an excellent method for endotracheal intubation for a patient with a difficult airway who is breathing spontaneously.

Several devices are available in sizes appropriate for infants and children. Video laryngoscopy is not necessarily associated with improved performance of pediatric endotracheal intubation, especially when performed by inexperienced providers. However, practitioners with airway training and experience, even those who are relatively early in their careers (ie, anesthesiology residents), can use these advanced laryngoscopes effectively with little additional training and orientation. In selected patients with limited neck or mouth opening, video laryngoscopy may markedly improve the ability to secure the airway.

Emergency departments should have equipment and supplies available in a readily identifiable location, such as a &quot;difficult airway box&quot;. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Alternative airway techniques'</a> above.)</p><p>Once the child with a difficult airway is identified, a specific plan for management must be developed that includes mobilizing appropriate personnel and assembling specialized equipment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63518\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63518 \">algorithm 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58510 \">algorithm 1B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 1C</a>).

The most expert physician available may be from anesthesia or otorhinolaryngology rather than emergency medicine or pediatrics, and they may provide valuable assistance in the rare case of a difficult pediatric airway. An approach to management decisions should consider the urgency of establishing an airway (&quot;crash airway&quot;) and the likelihood that rapid sequence intubation (RSI) will be successful.
