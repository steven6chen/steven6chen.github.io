Twenty-five to 40 percent of HIV-positive patients will develop a malignancy, with approximately 10 percent developing a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Although variable according to histologic subtype, the overall incidence of NHL has declined with the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Nevertheless, the incidence of NHL in HIV seropositive patients is considerably greater than that of the non-HIV-infected population. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General issues'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of ART'</a> above.)</p><p>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related NHL can be divided into three general categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic NHL (&gt;80 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary effusion (or body cavity) lymphoma (&lt;5 percent)</p><p/><p>The most common systemic NHL subtypes seen in HIV-positive persons are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burkitt lymphoma (approximately 25 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL, approximately 75 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmablastic lymphoma (less than 1 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell lymphoma (1 to 3 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indolent B cell lymphoma (&lt;10 percent)</p><p/><p>While many NHL subtypes are also seen in patients without immunocompromise, primary effusion lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma occur predominantly in immunocompromised patients, particularly those infected with HIV. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Specific NHL subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p>Risk factors for AIDS-related lymphoma include both HIV-specific risk factors, such as a low CD4 count and high HIV viral load, and more general risk factors known to increase the risk of NHL in patients without HIV. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Past history'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of NHL in the setting of HIV infection is poorly understood, but immune deregulation leading to loss of control of viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus is thought to play an important role. AIDS-related NHLs are most commonly derived from B cells. There is an unregulated expansion of these B cells that are arrested in development and unable to undergo terminal differentiation. Genetic alterations may be involved, not only in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related lymphomas, but also in determining the histology of the resulting clonal proliferation(s).
