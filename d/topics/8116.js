Ductopenia (a pathologic description) refers to the associated reduction in the number of intrahepatic bile ducts, a process that ultimately leads to cholestasis.</p><p>The diagnosis is made pathologically, although it can be suggested on imaging tests such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography when disease is advanced. There are multiple etiologies that can result in this final common pathologic picture, including autoimmune disorders, medications, genetic abnormalities, infectious diseases, and neoplastic disorders. The prognosis and treatment depend on the etiology and degree of injury. This topic will review the anatomy, classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this heterogeneous group of disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biliary tree is the tubular system of ducts that transports bile from the liver to the small intestine. It is divided into intra- and extrahepatic systems. Few disease states involve both systems, thus allowing for a natural taxonomic separation between the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extrahepatic system includes the right and left hepatic ducts, cystic duct, and common bile duct.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intrahepatic biliary tree contains ducts proximal to the right and left hepatic ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The intrahepatic system is further divided into intrahepatic large bile ducts (segmental and area ducts) that are grossly visible, and the intrahepatic small bile ducts (septal, interlobular, ductules, and canal of Hering).</p><p/><p>The diameter of the bile ducts steadily decreases from the liver hilum toward the periphery. The bile ducts, as well as branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein, form a triad in the portal tract. Interlobular bile ducts are identified in portal tracts near arterial branches of similar size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryology and development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver, gallbladder, and biliary system all arise embryologically from an outgrowth of the foregut. The cranial portion of this bud develops into liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, while a smaller caudal portion becomes the gallbladder, common bile duct, and cystic duct. Common endodermal cells differentiate into hepatocytes and the epithelial lining of the intrahepatic ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The biliary epithelial cells then form a bilayered structure (the ductal plate) around branches of the portal vein. Small dilations between the ductal plate layers develop into the bile ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductopenia (also referred to as bile duct paucity and vanishing bile duct syndrome) is a descriptive term for interlobular and septal bile duct loss from any cause. It is a well-recognized disorder in children, but was not described in adults until 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In both children and adults it can be associated with progressive destruction and disappearance of segments of the intrahepatic biliary tree.</p><p>Because ductopenia primarily involves the interlobular bile ducts, it has been referred to as &quot;small-duct damage&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is considered to be present when there is loss of interlobular bile ducts in more than 50 percent of small portal tracts, provided that the pathological specimen contains at least 10 portal tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79064 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF INTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCT INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary homeostasis exists as a balance between cell death and regeneration. Liver stem cells from the canal of Hering are the likely source of new biliary cells, a process regulated via B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. BAX, an apoptosis promoter, and BCL-2, which regulates apoptosis, are both expressed on bile duct cells. However, BAX is expressed along the entire biliary tree, whereas BCL-2 appears to be limited to bile ductules and interlobular bile ducts.</p><p>Biliary apoptosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cholangiopathies and may actually be underappreciated due to the difficulty in accurately identifying apoptotic biliary cells in hematoxylin and eosin-stained specimens. Several mechanisms have been implicated as the initiation event in pathologic biliary apoptosis, including: <span class=\"nowrap\">Fas/FasL,</span> perforin and granzyme B, TNF-alpha, oxidative stress, and downregulation of BCL-2.</p><p>Bile duct loss may be reversible. Recovery from drug-induced ductopenia is preceded by a ductular proliferation, followed by reappearance of bile ducts. However, recovery may not be possible when apoptosis exceeds the regenerative response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, ductal plate formation is an integral step in intrahepatic bile duct development.

Biochemical tests of liver function may ultimately improve or normalize (and jaundice resolve), but progressive bile duct loss can lead to secondary cirrhosis, liver failure, and death or transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">ISCHEMIC CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biliary epithelium receives its blood supply exclusively from the hepatic artery; thus, any disruption in this blood flow can result in ischemic necrosis and resultant ductopenia. This can be a serious complication, especially after liver transplantation, and often leads to retransplantation or biliary strictures and abscesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Long-term management of transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations and course are highly variable, reflecting the varied underlying causes. Disease onset can be rapid, as in acute cellular rejection, or gradual, as is typical for primary biliary cholangitis.</p><p>Most patients are identified either by abnormal liver chemistries or clinical complaints. Symptoms may reflect specific features of the underlying disease process, although more general constitutional complaints are common and include fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Patients frequently complain of pruritus and, when disease is severe and prolonged, can experience typical manifestations of cholestasis such as gallstone formation, hyperlipidemia, malabsorption, xanthelasmas, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Patients with progressive disease leading to cirrhosis can develop complications related to portal hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is established by liver biopsy in the appropriate clinical setting. Evaluation should include imaging tests to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction and appropriate serologic evaluation when there is suspicion for particular clinical diagnoses (eg, antimitochondrial antibodies in patients suspected of having primary biliary cholangitis). A careful history including all recent prescription and nonprescription drug use is essential since drug-induced cholestasis is common and drug withdrawal is essential. Idiopathic adulthood ductopenia (IAD) is present in adults with otherwise unexplained ductopenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrahepatic biliary obstruction should be excluded via magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Because the disease is characterized by small duct injury, imaging tests are generally less helpful than liver biopsy for establishing the diagnosis. Cholangiography is usually normal until extensive fibrosis from secondary biliary cirrhosis develops, in which the biliary tree may appeared &quot;pruned,&quot; reflecting the loss of small bile ducts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory evaluation should include, at the minimum, serum chemistries and liver biochemical tests. Laboratory investigations generally reflect cholestasis with predominantly conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia and markedly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase, often more than 3x the upper limit of normal (ULN). A moderate aminotransferase elevation may also be present, but is rarely more than 10x ULN.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation should also include judicious testing for specific diagnoses when there is clinical suspicion. This may include testing for viral and autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, sarcoidosis, and malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A liver biopsy can help establish the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of liver disease. As noted above, ductopenia is considered to be present when there is loss of interlobular bile ducts in more than 50 percent of small portal tracts, provided that the pathological specimen contains at least 10 portal tracts. IAD can be categorized as mild (a loss of &le;50 percent of the interlobular bile ducts) or severe (loss of &gt;50 percent of the bile ducts). Severe IAD is associated with a more aggressive clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Diagnostic yield can be increased by immunostaining with cytokeratin 7 and 19, both of which identify biliary elements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81586\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81586 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62914 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ductular proliferation may coexist with interlobular duct loss, and thus ductules must be distinguished from bile ducts. Bile ducts parallel hepatic artery branches of similar size, whereas ductular proliferation tends to appear near the limiting plate or within lobules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are generally two potential outcomes in patients with ductopenia: progressive, irreversible bile duct loss leading to extensive ductopenia and biliary cirrhosis or biliary epithelial regeneration and clinical recovery over months to years. The outcome is often unpredictable and depends on the underlying etiology of bile duct loss and available treatments. As a result, patients should be followed regularly by assessment of liver biochemical tests.</p><p>Idiopathic ductopenia has been associated with a poor prognosis in both children and adults; up to 50 percent of patients progress to liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>].

Hepatic decompensation tends to be slow and reflects progressive biliary obstruction and the development of secondary biliary cirrhosis. The prognosis may be better in those diagnosed when they are 40 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-ductopenia-and-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment choices depend mainly upon the underlying etiology of ductopenia. They may include drug withdrawal, choleretic agents, and immunosuppression. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for idiopathic bile duct loss. Thus, treatment frequently centers on supportive care and control of symptoms. In addition, two specific approaches have been tried: treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA; a synthetic bile salt) and immunosuppression.
