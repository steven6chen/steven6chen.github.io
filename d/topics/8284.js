Histologically, HIVAN is a collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90315\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90315 \">picture 1</a>), accompanied by microcystic tubular dilatation and interstitial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Issues related to HIVAN will be discussed in this topic. An overview of kidney disease in patients with HIV infection and discussions of electrolyte abnormalities, dialysis, and transplantation in HIV-positive patients are provided elsewhere.

This transgenic mouse model expresses a <span class=\"nowrap\">gag/pol-deleted</span> HIV-1 provirus in kidney and develops proteinuria, renal failure, and histologic findings resembling human HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Following the reciprocal transplantation of kidneys between transgenic and wild-type mice, kidney disease develops only in kidneys donated by transgenic animals, suggesting that HIV gene expression in kidney cells is required for the development of HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Transgenic mouse models suggest that certain HIV genes, in particular, Nef and Vpr, are specifically involved in the pathogenesis of HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>HIV directly infects glomerular and renal tubular epithelial cells in humans with HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that HIV transgene expression induces dedifferentiation and proliferation of glomerular epithelial cells and impairs cytokinesis in tubular epithelial cells.</p><p>The strong association between HIVAN and black race indicates that host genetic factors are also important. Human genetic studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the <em>APOL1</em> gene (on chromosome 22) that are strongly linked to increased risk of HIVAN as well as idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. However, these variants, which are present almost exclusively in individuals of West African descent, do not appear to be associated with the severity of disease among those with biopsy-proven HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The pathogenic role of <em>APOL1</em> in HIVAN pathogenesis is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H1626413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'APOL1 in African Americans'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H9804961\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'FSGS in African Americans'</a>.)</p><p>Several other genes have been identified based upon differential expression in HIVAN, although their role in pathogenesis has not been elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Breeding the Tg26 transgenic mouse onto different genetic backgrounds resulted in varying severity of kidney disease. Genetic studies in this model resulted in the identification of a susceptibility locus on chromosome 3, a genetic region that has been linked to other kidney diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5577956\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIVAN displays a striking racial predilection for individuals of African descent and is more closely associated with black race than any other cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) except sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced the incidence of ESRD attributed to HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a large urban cohort study, for example, the incidence of clinical or biopsy-proven HIVAN declined following the introduction of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A large series of kidney biopsies from the same urban HIV population demonstrated that, between 1995 and 2004, the proportion of biopsies revealing HIVAN declined from approximately 80 percent in 1997 to less than 30 percent in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) demonstrate a plateau in the annual incidence of ESRD attributed to HIVAN after 1995, with evidence of further decline in subsequent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Survival of patients with ESRD attributed to HIVAN has also improved, although it remains lower than that of patients with ESRD from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11947718\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with HIVAN, the following features are usually present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Black race</strong> &ndash; In studies of adult and pediatric patients with HIVAN, 96 to 100 percent were of African descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. According to data from the US Renal Data System (USRDS), more than 85 percent of new end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases attributed to HIVAN occur in African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced HIV disease</strong> &ndash; In a study of 57 patients with proven HIVAN, approximately half of whom were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), the mean HIV viral load was greater than 30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> and the mean CD4 cell count was 127 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> (64 percent had a CD4 count less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In two other studies, 81 and 90 percent of patients who presented with HIVAN had CD4 positive T-cell counts less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. It is apparent from these studies that HIVAN can present in patients with less advanced HIV infection. In addition, HIVAN has been reported in patients with acute HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heavy proteinuria</strong> &ndash; In a study of 71 children with HIVAN, 72 percent had nephrotic-range proteinuria at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Studies in adults had similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Among 57 patients with HIVAN, for example, mean proteinuria was 4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> and only 14 percent of patients had proteinuria less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, patients with HIVAN may have substantially less proteinuria early during the course of their disease. As an example, a study from South Africa found early HIVAN in six of seven ART-na&iuml;ve patients who had persistent moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;); such patients might not undergo kidney biopsy in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These findings suggest that HIVAN should also be considered in patients with lesser degrees of proteinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid decline in kidney function</strong> &ndash; At the time of HIVAN diagnosis, adult patients often have severely reduced kidney function, which is attributed to the rapidly progressive course. In two adult studies of patients with HIVAN, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) at the time of HIVAN diagnosis were, respectively, 10 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Children may not have similarly severe kidney dysfunction at the time of presentation, although this may be a result of ascertainment bias rather than a true difference in the disease course. Among 71 South African children diagnosed with HIVAN, for example, only one-third had an eGFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>Other manifestations, such as hematuria, hypertension, and edema, may also be present, although the frequency of hypertension and edema are lower than may be expected in patients with severe proteinuria and decreased eGFR. In three studies of adult and pediatric patients with HIVAN, the following characteristics were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria (45 to 75 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension (12 to 26 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema (22 to 59 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11947725\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient suspected of having HIVAN based upon clinical manifestations, the diagnosis must be established by a kidney biopsy as patients suspected of having HIVAN on clinical grounds often have an alternative histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5578907\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIVAN is characterized by the collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90315\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90315 \">picture 1</a>).

Tubuloreticular inclusions may also be identified on electron microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90316\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90316 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>]. While this unique histologic pattern was initially considered pathognomonic for HIVAN, virtually indistinguishable findings have been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates and interferon.

Dedifferentiation can be demonstrated by loss of maturity markers such as synaptopodin and expression of the cell-cycle protein Ki-67 in glomerular epithelial cells from animal models and patients with HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5578915\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, patients suspected of having HIVAN based upon the clinical presentation may actually have a different histologic diagnosis.

Overall, HIVAN accounted for only 35 percent of biopsies; other common diagnoses included non-collapsing FSGS (22 percent of biopsies) and a variety of immune complex glomerular diseases. In an updated biopsy series from the same center, both HIVAN and HIV immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK) occurred predominantly in African Americans with advanced HIV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and the addition of <em>APOL1</em> genotype to clinical data did not significantly improve the prediction of HIVAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>These and other studies illustrate the importance of obtaining a kidney biopsy to confirm a suspected diagnosis of HIVAN and exclude alternative diagnoses.

The strong associations of HIVAN with black race and <em>APOL1</em> gene polymorphisms illustrate the importance of host genetic factors. (See <a href=\"#H5577733\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIVAN is more closely associated with black race than any other cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) except sickle cell disease and is a leading cause of ESRD in young African-American adults. The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced the incidence of ESRD attributed to HIVAN. (See <a href=\"#H5577956\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with HIVAN, the following features are common (see <a href=\"#H11947718\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Black race</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced HIV disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heavy proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid decline in kidney function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient suspected of having HIVAN based upon clinical manifestations, the diagnosis should be established by a kidney biopsy as many patients suspected of having HIVAN on clinical grounds will have an alternative histologic diagnosis.

In addition to collapsing FSGS, HIVAN is typically characterized by dilated tubules and significant interstitial inflammation.
