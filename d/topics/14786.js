Pathologic perforating veins are those that have a diameter &ge;3.5 mm, outward flow (reflux) &ge;0.5 seconds, and are located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer (CEAP: C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The vein to be treated is generally &gt;5 mm which should easily accommodate the device.

However, case reports have documented potential benefit from early endovenous ablation in patients with superficial vein thrombosis of the distal great saphenous vein with a thrombus-free segment proximally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In such circumstances, the catheter is never passed through the clot burden. </p><p>Pregnant patients should defer treatment until after delivery.</p><p>Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is a relative contraindication because of the increased risk for nonhealing wounds. Patients with mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">arterial/venous</span> ulcers are difficult to manage and the patient should be referred to a vascular specialist. When severe arterial disease mixed with venous disease is identified, the arterial disease may need to be addressed first. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Very large veins are a relative contraindication to radiofrequency ablation. Vein diameter greater than 15 mm may have a higher risk of Type I failure (ie, nonclosure); however, successful closure has been reported for veins as large as 24 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Alterations in technique can be used to manage larger veins.

These and the saphenous accessory veins are collectively referred to as axial veins. The great saphenous vein joins the common femoral vein at the confluence of the superficial inguinal veins via the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). The small saphenous vein has more variable anatomy, especially with respect to the location of the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders&quot;, section on 'Superficial venous system (As)'</a>).</p><p>The deep veins of the lower extremity are contained within the deep muscle compartments bounded by the muscle fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219 \">figure 2</a>).

It passes through the adductor canal, after which it becomes superficial and closely related to the saphenous vein. The saphenous nerve is most vulnerable to injury in the distal calf, where it actually adheres to the saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sural nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sural nerve is a cutaneous nerve coursing along the small saphenous vein and traversing posterior to the lateral malleolus toward the fifth toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62917 \">figure 3</a>). Identi&#64257;cation of the relative anatomy of the sural nerve to the small saphenous vein is important to avoid thermal injury to the sural nerve during radiofrequency ablation. In an autopsy study, it was shown that the sural nerve is separated from the small saphenous vein by the deep muscular fascia above the inferior border of the gastrocnemius muscle; however, below the inferior border of the gastrocnemius muscle, the sural nerve perforates the deep fascia and runs in close proximity to the small saphenous vein, where it can easily be injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The sural nerve can vary in its course from the usual anatomy in up to one-half of patients and can usually be identified using ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOFREQUENCY DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency ablation devices generate a high frequency alternating current (in the radio range of frequencies, 300 kHz to 1 MHz) that is transmitted through an electrode. The resultant energy heats the vein wall adjacent the probe to a prespecified temperature which alters the protein structure of the vein, effecting its closure.</p><p>The original radiofrequency ablation catheter (VNUS Closure) was available in two sizes and introduced through a 6F or 8F sheath. The tip was heated to 85 or 90 degrees Celsius and then the catheter was pulled back slowly (1 to 2 mm per second), maintaining a constant temperature to effect closure of the vein. This catheter is no longer available.</p><p>The subsequent catheter design (ClosureFast) is available for a 7F delivery system, and heats to 120 degrees Celsius. Energy is delivered over 20 second intervals through either a 3 or a 7 cm catheter segment. The catheter is withdrawn in a series of 3 or 7 cm steps with the number of steps depending upon the length of the vein being treated; pullback times are generally faster than with the original catheter.</p><p>Catheters designed to treat perforating veins (ClosureRFS, rFITT) are shorter and have smaller catheter diameters.

The general technique is described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prepare and position the patient</strong> &ndash; Following sterile preparation of the lower extremity, the patient is placed in reverse Trendelenburg position to facilitate visualization of the veins for sheath placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Access vein and place the device sheath</strong> &ndash; With ultrasound guidance, an echogenic micropuncture needle is used to access the chosen vein and the micropuncture <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> placed with the Seldinger technique. The inner dilator of the micropuncture sheath is removed, and a J-wire is placed through the micropuncture sheath and checked with ultrasound; the micropuncture sheath is then removed. The 7F <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> is placed over the 0.035&quot; wire, the wire and inner dilator removed, and the 7F sheath flushed with heparinized saline. On occasion, the vein is unable to be accessed percutaneously. Pressure is applied to the puncture site to control bleeding as needed. Percutaneous access can be reattempted more proximally or a small cutdown performed and the sheath introduced directly into the vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Position the catheter</strong> &ndash; The ultrasound probe is placed at the proximal extent of the planned ablation (eg, saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction) and the radiofrequency catheter is placed through the sheath. The catheter often advances through the vein with ease; however, excessive tortuosity or the presence of large perforating veins may necessitate the need for a guidewire. A long, floppy wire (eg, glidewire 0.025&quot;) is placed through the sheath and advanced to the proximal vein under ultrasound guidance. Once the position of the wire is confirmed, the catheter is passed over the guidewire and positioned in the proximal vein. The patient is then placed in Trendelenburg position to empty the vein. The tip of the catheter is positioned at least 2.5 cm below the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. For the great saphenous vein, the optimal closure level is below the origin of the superficial epigastric vein to preserve flow in the proximal great saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Instill tumescent anesthesia</strong> &ndash; With ultrasound visualization, the echogenic micropuncture needle is used to inject tumescent anesthesia into the saphenous sheath surrounding the vein.

Vein ablation is carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications for the type of catheter chosen. The device is activated, transferring energy to the blood and vein wall, resulting in immediate intimal loss and subsequent thrombosis as the probe is withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Following radiofrequency ablation, the treated vein has thickened walls (ie, hyperechoic doughnut) with thrombus in the lumen of the vein and no identifiable venous flow. The junction of the treated vein with the deep venous system is also imaged to exclude the presence of deep venous thrombosis. The proximal vein at the junction should be compressible and hypoechoic and without the presence of any intraluminal debris which would appear hyperechoic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perform supplemental procedures</strong> &ndash; Following successful closure of the targeted veins, the extremity is evaluated for any significant residual varicose veins, which can be managed with either phlebectomy or sclerotherapy depending upon size or operator preference. Large varicose veins and those located on the thigh are less likely to respond to elimination of reflux, and we prefer to manage these concurrently with the ablation procedure. For smaller veins, supplemental procedures may be delayed as many of these smaller veins will reduce in size over time.

The sheath is typically placed above the knee to minimize the likelihood of injury to the saphenous nerve. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Saphenous nerve'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small saphenous ablation</strong> &ndash; In small saphenous ablation, the catheter tip is positioned at the fascial curve. The sheath is placed at the lower border of the gastrocnemius muscle, and never below, to avoid thermal injury to the medial cutaneous sural nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tumescent anesthesia is instilled, as with the great saphenous vein, and the procedure is performed with the patient in Trendelenburg position. Instillation of the tumescent is extremely important in small saphenous vein ablation because of the proximity of the vein to the sural nerve. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sural nerve'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Accessory saphenous ablation</strong> &ndash; Compared with the saphenous veins, the accessory veins have a shorter straight segment and the remainder is tortuous. The straight portion of the vein can be ablated with the radiofrequency device and the more tortuous segments subsequently managed with phlebectomy. Accessory saphenous ablation is performed in a manner similar to great saphenous ablation. The catheter tip is positioned 2.5 cm below the saphenofemoral junction. Adequate tumescent anesthesia is important since these veins can be more superficial and often do not have a well-defined saphenous sheath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perforator ablation</strong> &ndash; Incompetent perforating veins (IPVs) can also be occluded with radiofrequency (ie, TRans-Luminal Occlusion of Perforators [TRLOP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Two general methods use either rigid or flexible catheters. The procedure is performed with ultrasound guidance. The perforator is accessed either directly or with the Seldinger technique. The catheter is positioned 5 to 10 mm above the muscular fascia to avoid application of heat to the deep veins. The tumescent is administered while the catheter is held in place. With the patient in Trendelenburg position, the ablation is performed according to the manufacturer's specifications for the chosen device. The catheter is removed and completion ultrasound performed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents are generally used in all patients without a contraindication to avoid a significant phlebitic reaction. Patients who have a contraindication to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications may require stronger analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) for a short period of time.

This classification scheme, and a similar but simplified classification that may be more useful clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], are illustrated in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112355%7ESURG%2F111960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112355 graphicRef111960 \">figure 4A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant pain is not typical following radiofrequency ablation even when vein excisions are concurrently performed.

Superficial vein thrombosis is managed conservatively. More significant signs or symptoms of pain or edema warrant ultrasound examination to evaluate for the presence of proximal clot extension. The management of patients with duplex confirmed extension of thrombus up to, but not into, the deep venous system following endovenous ablation is controversial. Patients have been managed with serial duplex examinations, anticoagulation, or open surgical ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. We prefer serial duplex and repeat ultrasound within a week if thrombus is identified at the <span class=\"nowrap\">saphenofemoral/saphenopopliteal</span> junction, extending up to, but not into, the deep vein. The management of superficial vein thrombosis is discussed elsewhere.

Saphenous nerve injury may be more likely when the endovenous sheath is placed below the level of the midcalf, due to the adherence of the saphenous nerve to the saphenous vein in the distal third of the calf [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The majority of venous thrombosis following radiofrequency ablation appears to be related to extension of clot from thrombus induced in the ablated vein. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is a term which refers to this mechanism. Direct thermal injury to the deep veins can also occur due to catheter malposition. </p><p>In one retrospective study, deep venous thrombosis was not significantly associated with patient demographics, ablation indication, type of anesthesia or use of adjunctive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, a separate review of 500 patients found that great saphenous vein diameter &gt;8 mm at the level of the saphenofemoral junction, or a history of DVT, increased the risk for thrombus extension into the femoral vein (EHIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Patients diagnosed with thrombus within the deep veins are anticoagulated (EHIT: level 3 and 4) and a follow-up duplex ultrasound should be obtained within 7 to 10 days. In some cases of EHIT following great saphenous ablation, thrombus contraction occurs and thrombus is no longer apparent within the common femoral vein, at which point anticoagulation may be discontinued. Persistence of deep vein thrombus is managed according to standard protocols.
