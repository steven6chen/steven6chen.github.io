Patients with CF have abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across secretory epithelia, resulting in thickened, viscous secretions in the bronchi, biliary tract, pancreas, intestines, and reproductive system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although the disease is systemic, progressive lung disease continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality for most patients. Over a highly variable time course ranging from months to decades after birth, individuals eventually develop chronic infection of the respiratory tract with a characteristic array of bacterial flora, leading to progressive respiratory insufficiency and eventual respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The genetics and pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis are discussed here. Details of the clinical manifestations and effects of the disease process are discussed separately.

Clinical disease requires disease-causing mutations in both copies of the <em>CFTR</em> gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The normal CFTR gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>CFTR</em> belongs to the ABC (<strong>A</strong>TP-<strong>B</strong>inding <strong>C</strong>assette) family of proteins, a large group of related proteins that share transmembrane transport functions. ABC proteins include bacterial transporters for amino acids and other nutrients, surfactant transport proteins, and the mammalian multidrug resistance (MDR) protein (or P-glycoprotein).</p><p><em>CFTR</em> functions as a regulated chloride channel, which, in turn, may regulate the activity of other chloride and sodium channels at the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The <em>CFTR</em> gene spans 250 kilobases on chromosome 7, encoding 1480 amino acids in the mature protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60265 \">figure 1</a>). The protein has two groups of six membrane-spanning regions, two intracellular nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs), and a highly charged &quot;R domain&quot; containing multiple phosphorylation sites. Activation of the chloride channel requires phosphokinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain, and the continuous presence of ATP in the NBFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic changes in CFTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotypic expression of disease varies widely, primarily as a function of the specific mutation (or mutations) present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].

This mutation is found in approximately 70 percent of Caucasian patients with CF in the United States. Certain mutations are found at higher frequency in some ethnic groups because of apparent founder effects. As an example, five mutations account for an estimated 97 percent of CF alleles in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A subset of the most frequent <em>CFTR</em> mutations is recommended for initial testing since the majority of individual mutations are very rare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In general, mutations in classes I to III cause more severe disease than those in classes IV and V [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26</a>]. However, the clinical implications of a specific combination of mutations are often unclear, perhaps because of the influence of gene modifiers. Genotype-phenotype correlations are weak for pulmonary disease in CF and somewhat stronger for the pancreatic insufficiency phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Gene modifiers'</a> below.)</p><p>In most cases, specific mutations should not be used to make assumptions about the severity of disease in an individual patient. Knowledge of the mutations may be useful to guide initial therapy, but clinical decisions should be guided by observable parameters of growth, lung function, and nutritional status. Some investigational therapies are directed at specific classes of <em>CFTR</em> mutation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies#H3393763\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Investigational therapies&quot;, section on 'Reversing the consequences of CFTR mutations on protein function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Class I mutations: Defective protein production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of defect is usually caused by nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations, leading to premature termination of the mRNA and complete absence of <em>CFTR</em> protein. Examples include G542X, W1282X, R553X, 621+G&gt;T, and 1717-1G&gt;A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This type of mutation accounts for two to five percent of cystic fibrosis cases worldwide. In some genetically homogenous populations, the percentage may be much higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Class II mutations: Defective protein processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Class II mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> sequence cause abnormal post-translational processing of the <em>CFTR</em> protein, which prevents the protein from trafficking to the correct cellular location. This category includes the F508del (c.1521_1523delCTT) mutation, which accounts for 70 percent of the disease-causing alleles in the United States. Fifty percent of CF patients are homozygous for this mutation, and 90 percent will carry at least one copy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. N1303Lys (N1303K) and A455E are also class II mutations; the latter is associated with relatively mild lung disease and pancreatic sufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Class III mutations: Defective regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Class III mutations lead to diminished channel activity in response to ATP. Many involve alterations of the NBF regions, NBO1 and NBO2, which may retain varying degrees of sensitivity to nucleotide binding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80517 \">figure 2</a>). Other <em>CFTR</em> mutations, mapped to the R domain, may also fall into this category. G551D is the most common class III mutation in Caucasian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Class IV mutations: Defective conduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With class IV mutations, the protein is produced and correctly localized to the cell surface. However, although chloride currents are generated in response to cAMP stimulation, the rate of ion flow and the duration of channel opening are reduced when compared to normal <em>CFTR</em> function. R117H is the most common class IV mutation in Caucasian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Class V mutations: Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This class of mutation is not included in some schemes. It includes mutations that alter the stability of mRNA and others that alter the stability of the mature CFTR protein (the latter is sometimes classified separately into a Class VI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The mutation A455E has been classified as Class II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] or Class V [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31,32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE MODIFIERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inconsistent association between CF genotypes and phenotypes points to a role for gene modifiers. These genetic variations are not directly related to the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR)</em> gene but affect the severity or clinical manifestations of disease. Research into a variety of candidate genes is ongoing. There is good evidence that the following genes act as modifiers in CF, and that approximately 20 percent of patients with classic CF carry variants in one or both of these genes that exacerbates the pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TGF-beta 1 &ndash; Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent suppressor of T cell activation and can decrease T cell proliferation and cytokine production. In a study of 808 patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation, polymorphisms in the TGF-beta 1 gene were associated with more severe CF lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In individuals with CF, variant MBL alleles are associated with reduced lung function, increased risk for chronic <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and Burkholderia cepacia complex infections, and early death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In young patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency, lower MBL-2 protein levels were associated with a steeper rate of decline in lung function and earlier age at first infection with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These effects were exaggerated in individuals who also carried the TGF-beta 1 mutation described above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INCOMPLETE PHENOTYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 10 percent of patients with suspected CF, the disease manifestations appear to be unusually mild or limited to one organ system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although the term &quot;nonclassic CF&quot; has been applied to this group of patients, the term is preferably applied to patients who fulfill diagnostic criteria for disease but have intermediate sweat chloride results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Nonclassic CF'</a>.) </p><p>The phenotypes and genetic causes of patients with this clinical presentation were described in a study of 158 patients who were referred for detailed genotyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Standard genetic testing for CF had been performed on each of these patients prior to inclusion in the study, and this panel had identified either no <em>CFTR</em> mutations or only one mutation. The characteristics of 74 of these patients had been previously published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The subjects underwent detailed genetic testing using direct DNA sequencing and structured clinical phenotyping. The following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On detailed genetic testing, 36 percent of patients proved to have two <em>CFTR</em> mutations, 24 percent had one mutation, and 40 percent did not have any detectable mutations despite exhaustive analysis. It is possible that undetected mutations in the introns, promoters, or regulatory regions of the gene contributed to the phenotypic findings in some of these individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neither sweat chloride concentrations nor pulmonary function tests correlated with the number of <em>CFTR</em> mutations. However, 39 percent of the patients had intermediate sweat chloride concentrations (in the 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> range) and 14 percent had normal sweat chloride concentrations (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with two <em>CFTR</em> mutations were more likely to have absence of the vas deferens and the presence of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in sputum as compared to those patients with zero <em>CFTR</em> mutations. Patients with zero <em>CFTR</em> mutations frequently presented with steatorrhea.</p><p/><p>The pathogenetic mechanism responsible for clinical disease without <em>CFTR</em> mutations is unclear. The above findings suggest that factors other than <em>CFTR</em> mutations may lead to disease that is phenotypically similar to CF in some patients. Patients who do not have two <em>CFTR</em> mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have normal or borderline sweat chloride concentrations should be rigorously evaluated for other causes of their symptoms (eg, evaluation for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome in those with pancreatic insufficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shwachman-diamond-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shwachman-Diamond syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>CFTR-related metabolic syndrome</strong> &ndash; Newborn screening programs perform initial identification by screening for hypertrypsinogenemia, followed in most states by screening for common <em>CFTR</em> genotypes. These screening programs are increasingly identifying infants who have abnormal serum trypsinogen levels, sweat chloride levels that are either normal or in a borderline range (30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/dl),</span> and zero to two <em>CFTR</em> mutations, at least one of which is not recognized as a &quot;CF causing mutation.&quot; This combination of characteristics neither permits nor excludes the diagnosis of CF, so these infants are provisionally categorized as having &quot;<em>CFTR</em>-related metabolic syndrome&quot; (CRMS). Some of these infants will ultimately be found to have two disease-causing <em>CFTR</em> mutations, will develop signs and symptoms of CF, or will develop a diagnostic sweat chloride, and can be categorized as having true CF. Other children may develop <em>CFTR</em>-related disorders such as chronic pancreatitis or male infertility, without meeting criteria for a CF diagnosis. Other children initially categorized as having CRMS may never develop any signs or symptoms of <em>CFTR</em>-related disease. Because the natural history of infants with CRMS is unpredictable, these infants require continued evaluation and screening during the first few years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H49145351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'CFTR-related metabolic syndrome'</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of the organ dysfunction seen in CF has been studied in humans and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator <em>CFTR</em>-knockout mice, but remains incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. It appears that the physical and chemical abnormalities of CF airway secretions result in chronic infection with phenotypically unique bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas species. Other genetic factors, including polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-a) gene, may increase susceptibility to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection and contribute to the clinical manifestations of CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Primary abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism have been noted in biopsies of <em>CFTR</em>-expressing tissue from patients with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These changes, which result in increased tissue levels of arachidonic acid, also are present in the mouse model of CF, but are not seen in tissue from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, increased tissue expression of arachidonic acid and its metabolites may contribute to the abnormal inflammation characteristic of CF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>CFTR</em> malfunction in the respiratory epithelium is associated with a variety of changes in electrolyte and water transport. The mechanisms involved and ultimate electrolyte composition of airway surface fluid in CF airways is a subject of ongoing research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11-13,44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,44-47</a>]. The net result of these changes is an alteration in the rheology of airway secretions, which become thick and difficult to clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. An associated finding is an increased concentration of chloride in sweat secretions, which constitutes one of the methods of diagnosis of CF.

Impaired flow of bile and pancreatic secretions cause maldigestion and malabsorption, as well as progressive liver and pancreatic disease, leading to CF-related diabetes. Because of thickened intestinal secretions and maldigestion, CF patients are prone to intestinal obstruction (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome or intussusception) and to rectal prolapse.

Recruited neutrophils subsequently release elastase, which overwhelms the antiproteases of the lung and contributes to tissue destruction in a process known as &quot;prolonged endobronchial protease activity&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, large amounts of DNA and cytosol matrix proteins are released by degranulating neutrophils, contributing to the increased viscosity of the airway mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Inflammation has been noted prior to the development of bacterial colonization, and may be triggered by viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In turn, chronic infection appears to be the major stimulus for an exuberant but ultimately ineffective inflammatory response that subsequently results in bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The inflammatory response itself appears to contribute to the progression of pulmonary dysfunction; this mechanism is the basis for the use of some anti-inflammatory agents in treating CF lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

This local hypoxia induces the characteristic phenotypic changes in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (and some other gram negative bacteria), including alginate production and loss of motility. This phenotype is consistent with the development of bacterial macrocolonies (or &quot;biofilms&quot;) within the hypoxic regions of the airway mucus layer. Once this occurs, eradication of the organism is almost impossible.

One study found that 36 percent of CF patients were colonized with a hypermutable strain of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> that often persisted for years; such mutator strains were not isolated from patients with acute <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection who did not have CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The frequent colonization and persistent infection caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in CF patients is also related to the defective CFTR protein itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Normal CFTR protein serves as the receptor for binding of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, and extracts LPS from the surface of the organism for endocytosis into epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/45,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,59,60</a>]. This results in increased intranuclear translocation of the nuclear transcription factor NF kappa B and subsequent immunoactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. This process does <strong>not</strong> occur in the presence of abnormal <em>CFTR</em> or in <em>CFTR</em>-knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], which may partially explain the inability of CF patients to control these infections. Disease-modifier genes appear to further affect the predisposition to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Gene modifiers'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877895282\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Clinical disease requires disease-causing mutations in both copies of the <em>CFTR</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenotypic expression of disease varies widely, as a function of the specific mutations present and the presence of gene modifiers. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetic changes in CFTR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations of the <em>CFTR</em> gene have been divided into five different classes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80517 \">figure 2</a>). In general, mutations in classes I to III cause more severe disease than those in classes IV and V. However, the clinical implications of a specific combination of mutations are often unclear, and specific mutations should not be used to make assumptions about the severity of disease in an individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetic changes in CFTR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subset of the most frequent <em>CFTR</em> mutations is recommended for initial testing, since the majority of individual mutations are very rare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetic changes in CFTR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common mutation is F508del (also noted as delta F508 or c.1521_1523delCTT, referring to deletion of three DNA bases coding for the 508<sup>th</sup> amino acid residue phenylalanine), which is found in approximately 70 percent of Caucasian patients with CF in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Class II mutations: Defective protein processing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene modifiers are genetic variations that are not directly related to the <em>CFTR</em> gene, but which nonetheless affect the severity or clinical manifestations of disease. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Mannose-binding lectin are important gene modifiers in CF, and approximately 20 percent of CF patients carry variants in one or both of these genes that may exacerbate the pulmonary disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Gene modifiers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>CFTR</em> malfunction is associated with low water content in secretions from the respiratory, pancreatic, and biliary epithelium, which causes the secretions to be viscous and difficult to clear. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal secretions'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the gastrointestinal tract, the abnormal bile and pancreatic secretions cause maldigestion and malabsorption, progressive liver and pancreatic disease, rectal prolapse, and intestinal obstruction (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome or intussusception). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the lung, the abnormal secretions cause chronic airway obstruction and reduce bacteriocidal killing, leading to progressive pulmonary colonization with pathogenic bacteria, and to the formation of bacterial biofilms. Chronic infection causes an inflammatory response and tissue destruction, causing bronchiectasis. Infection with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is particularly favored in patients with CF, due to abnormally decreased oxygen tension within the hyperviscous mucous layer. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chronic lung infection'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rowe SM, Miller S, Sorscher EJ.
