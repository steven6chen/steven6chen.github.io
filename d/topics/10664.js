The perineum is the area between the opening of the vagina and the anus. Some of these injuries are minor and tear only the skin. Others are more serious and can tear skin and muscle. In some cases, the tear goes from the vagina to the anus. These injuries are also called &quot;perineal injuries.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24442720\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes maternal injuries from childbirth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These injuries happen when the baby's head or shoulders tear the perineum during birth. The tears are more likely to happen if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby is very large</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother is giving birth for the first time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doctor or midwife helps pull the baby out with a device that holds onto the baby's head. This might be done if the baby gets partly stuck in the birth canal.</p><p/><p>Doctors and midwives sometimes cut the perineum just before the baby comes out to make the opening of the vagina larger. This is called an &quot;episiotomy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24442736\"><span class=\"h1\">How are maternal injuries from childbirth treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor skin tears often need no treatment and heal on their own. If you have a tear that goes deeper, your doctor or midwife will use stitches to repair the tear. These stitches dissolve over time and do not need to be taken out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24442751\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better while my injury heals?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people feel better if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take &quot;sitz&quot; baths &ndash; This is a shallow, warm bath that helps clean and heal the perineum. Take them at least twice a day for 5 to 10 minutes each. You can do it more frequently if you find it soothing. You do not need to add soap or any medicines to the water unless your doctor has recommended them. Pat the area dry with a soft towel. Do not rub.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a &quot;peri-bottle&quot; after going to the bathroom &ndash; After you urinate or have a bowel movement, you can use a peri-bottle to clean yourself. This is a small squeeze bottle you can fill with water then use to rinse the area. Try to do this instead of wiping with toilet paper.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines to relieve pain, such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p>If you got stitches for a serious tear, your doctor or midwife might recommend foods or medicines to keep your bowel movements soft. This makes you less likely to strain to push out a bowel movement, which might reopen the tear.</p><p>You shouldn't have sex until the tears heal. Sex can be painful and might reopen the tear. You should also not use tampons, or put anything else in your vagina, until after you have healed.</p><p>You should have an appointment with your doctor or midwife 1 to 2 months after the delivery. They will check how you are healing and tell you if it's OK to start having sex and using tampons again. When you start having sex again, it might be uncomfortable or even painful at first. You can use a water-based vaginal lubricant to help with this. Examples of lubricants include K-Y Jelly, Replens, and Astroglide. Talk with your doctor or midwife if the discomfort doesn't go away with time.</p><p>You might have vaginal bleeding after your delivery for up to 6 weeks. If you have bleeding that is heavier than a period, call your doctor or midwife.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24442766\"><span class=\"h1\">Can maternal injuries from childbirth be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. You might be less likely to have a vaginal injury during childbirth if you control your pushing when you give birth. This helps the perineum to stretch slowly, making it less likely to tear. Even if you had tearing during your first delivery, you might not have tearing during later deliveries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24442781\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
