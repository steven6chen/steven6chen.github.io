Surgical excision is curative in most cases of early stage disease, and patients at high risk of developing metastatic disease may benefit from adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with disseminated disease is a difficult problem. Systemic approaches that have been shown to provide clinically important benefit for appropriately selected patients with disseminated melanoma include immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors directed against CTLA-4 and programmed death 1 protein (PD1), and inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway with a BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients whose tumors contain a V600 mutation in the BRAF gene.</p><p>The role of surgery in the treatment of metastatic disease is discussed in this topic. An overview of the management of advanced melanoma is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434153966\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have limited sites of metastatic disease may be amenable to surgical resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105384\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105384 \">algorithm 1</a>). Complete surgical excision of limited metastatic disease can result in prolonged overall and occasionally relapse-free survival in carefully selected patients. Surgery for distant metastatic melanoma, however, is rarely curative since the majority of patients with distant metastases have widespread micrometastatic disease even if clinical and imaging criteria suggest limited spread. Resection should be reserved for the relief or prevention of morbidity due to local tumor growth and for patients in whom a longer survival might be expected with surgical rather than medical treatment.</p><p>When surgery is considered, careful patient selection is important and treatment must be individualized. Factors to be considered include the severity of symptoms, pace of disease progression, previous treatment and treatment response, patient age and medical condition, and the desires of the patient. Quality of life should be the principal goal of treatment for many patients.</p><p>The potential for complete surgical resection to benefit individual patients is suggested by the results of a prospective, phase II study from the Southwest Oncology Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this prospective, multicenter study, 64 of 77 carefully selected patients were able to undergo complete resection of all sites of metastatic disease. At a median follow-up of five years, the median relapse-free and overall survival durations were 5 and 21 months, respectively. Overall, the three and four-year survival rates were 36 and 31 percent, respectively, although late relapses continued to be observed after this time.</p><p>Similar disease-control and survival rates were observed in a phase III cancer vaccine immunotherapy trial, which included 263 patients who underwent complete resection of all metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several prerequisites must be met before attempted curative surgical treatment of metastatic disease in any malignancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary site must be controlled or controllable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient must be medically fit to withstand the planned surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific cancer should exhibit a metastatic pattern in which a significant percentage of patients have solitary organ or site metastases.</p><p/><p>Patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma frequently present with involvement of more than one disease site or organ. More so than with other cancers, melanoma is capable of involving every major organ within the body. Despite improvements in radiologic methods, the extent of metastatic disease in patients with melanoma may be underestimated by physical exam and imaging procedures. </p><p>In addition, a durable, substantial partial response to systemic therapy may reduce the tumor burden to a single site, thus making surgery a consideration as part of a multidisciplinary approach to consolidate the response. In some cases, such surgery may also serve to determine whether a residual abnormality following response to systemic treatment represents residual melanoma rather than an inflammatory reaction or, rarely, a distinct second malignancy. The use of surgery in this situation must be considered on an individualized basis, and decisions require input from a multidisciplinary team. (See <a href=\"#H434154051\" class=\"local\">'Surgery following systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following potentially curative resection of a cutaneous melanoma, routine monitoring of asymptomatic patients should focus on those sites most likely to harbor metastatic disease, particularly those sites that may have potentially resectable metastatic or locoregional disease. A careful history and examination of the skin, soft tissues, and all lymph node basins should be routinely performed. Many programs also recommend periodic chest radiograph and serum LDH. More sophisticated imaging studies (computed tomography [CT] or positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[PET]/CT</span> scans) should be performed if symptoms, physical findings, laboratory, or chest radiograph abnormalities are documented. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging work-up and surveillance after treatment of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If metastatic disease is identified, we recommend the following imaging evaluations to determine the full extent of disease prior to any surgical therapy: (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-in-melanoma#H1956359\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Nuclear medicine techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> with F-18-flourodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) can help distinguish malignant and nonmalignant tissue or reveal additional sites of occult metastatic disease, thus potentially altering the treatment plan. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434154051\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY FOLLOWING SYSTEMIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection of oligometastatic disease is sometimes useful in carefully selected patients after systemic therapy, particularly those with a good response to immunotherapy with either high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) or checkpoint inhibition (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, programmed death 1 protein [PD1] monoclonal antibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although this approach has not been proven to prolong survival, a significant number of these patients can achieve durable disease-free survival after such surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical resection of oligometastatic disease does not have an established role in patients treated with targeted therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vemurafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vemurafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabrafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabrafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trametinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trametinib</a>) for symptomatic metastatic disease since these patients almost invariably relapse when treatment is discontinued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma#H100472992\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecularly targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma&quot;, section on 'Vemurafenib'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-advanced-melanoma-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition#H175769012\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of advanced melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;, section on 'Ipilimumab'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC METASTATIC SITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advent of highly effective systemic therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and the <span class=\"nowrap\">BRAF/MEK</span> inhibitors for patients with metastatic melanoma has altered the approach to management of patients with metastatic disease. </p><p>Surgery is generally not an option for first-line therapy, except for limited, isolated soft tissue and nodal metastases that can be completely resected or for complications of metastatic disease in need of urgent palliation (eg, bleeding or obstructing gastrointestinal lesions). For other presentations, surgery may be indicated after systemic therapy has been used to control the majority of the metastatic disease.</p><p>Decisions about appropriateness of surgery should therefore be made as part of a multidisciplinary treatment plan with input from surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and radiology among others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excision is the fastest and most effective treatment for isolated or limited skin and soft tissue disease. Complete removal with a small margin of normal tissue is appropriate for a local recurrence, in transit or satellite metastasis. Extensive extremity skin or subcutaneous disease may be treated with hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion or infusion in specialized centers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: Management of local recurrence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Resection of isolated distant lymph node disease may provide palliation of symptoms or prevent morbidity from venous obstruction. However, deep iliac and aortocaval nodes that are replaced by melanoma may be difficult to dissect away from adjacent vascular structures.</p><p>Several studies have reported significant survival rates for patients with subcutaneous or distant lymph node metastases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 114 patients, the five-year survival after surgical resection was 33 percent for patients with subcutaneous metastases and 22 percent for those with distant lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 60 patients with superficial inguinal lymph node dissection and 72 with combined superficial and pelvic lymph node dissection, the overall survival rate was 34 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In patients with combined dissection, five-year survival was significantly higher in those without than those with pelvic lymph node metastases (47 versus 19 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with melanoma metastatic to inguinal nodes, the extent of nodal disease does not appear to influence prognosis. In one series of 227 patients undergoing inguinal lymphadenectomy for cutaneous melanoma, the five-year survival for patients with superficial or deep nodal involvement was 40 and 35 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>It is important to recognize that, in addition to suffering from selection bias, these studies of subcutaneous and nodal metastases do not account for the impact of any subsequent systemic therapy (limited though it might be prior to the advent of checkpoint inhibitor and MAP kinase inhibitor therapies) on long-term survival. Another problem is that more recent lymphatic staging techniques indicate that many patients have drainage to more than one regional lymphatic basin, suggesting that, in some instances, nodal recurrences thought to be distant metastatic disease (Stage IV) may actually have been atypical regional disease (Stage III). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, not all of these patients may have had true hematogenous spread of their disease. Taking all these factors into account, it is probably the rare patient with truly distant metastatic melanoma who will be cured of skin, subcutaneous, or lymph node disease with surgery alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent cause of death from metastatic melanoma is either respiratory failure or intracranial metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Surgical treatment of metastatic disease in these sites may be effective at relieving symptoms, even though survival may not be enhanced.</p><p>The results from two large reports illustrate the outcomes for patients undergoing resection of lung metastases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the International Registry of Lung Metastases defined parameters associated with a better prognosis following resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The five and ten-year survival rates in 282 patients were 22 and 16 percent after complete metastasectomy, while there were no long-term survivors after incomplete resection (n = 46). Poor prognostic factors included a metastasis-free interval less than 36 months and the presence of multiple lung metastases. Patients without these risk factors had the best five-year survival, followed by those with one and two risk factors (29, 20, and 7 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors affecting prognosis were analyzed in a single institution series of 318 patients who underwent metastasectomy for lung metastases over a 34-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Risk factors associated with a poorer prognosis in multivariate analysis included the presence of two or more metastases, a disease-free interval less than five years, the presence of extrathoracic disease, or nodular histology. For patients with none of these risk factors, the median survival was 14 months and the five-year survival was 26 percent. In contrast, patients with three or more risk factors had a median survival of five months and a 2 percent five-year survival.</p><p/><p>When surgery is being considered, conservative lung resections should be performed so as not to compromise options for subsequent systemic therapy. In addition, a second recurrence of metastatic disease is likely, which may further deplete functioning lung parenchyma.</p><p>The use of preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/computed</span> tomography (CT) scanning to improve the selection of patients for pulmonary metastasectomy is discussed separately, as are general aspects of surgery for pulmonary metastases.

Intracranial metastases are usually multiple but can be solitary in 25 to 40 percent of patients. Brain metastases are historically associated with a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of brain metastases in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical resection may provide effective palliation, prevent intracerebral hemorrhage, and is the treatment of choice for patients with accessible, solitary, large intracranial metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with multiple accessible lesions may have a prognosis similar to those with a solitary metastasis if all metastases can be completely resected. Surgical resection should be considered as an option whenever possible, although stereotactic radiosurgical approaches are often preferred for surgically inaccessible lesions, for small isolated lesions, or when multiple lesions are present.</p><p>The management of brain metastases in patients with metastatic melanoma is discussed separately.

The jejunum and ileum are the most commonly involved sites, followed by the colon, rectum, and stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Surgery is usually reserved for patients with the above complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 135 patients treated surgically for abdominal metastases from melanoma had a median survival of 11 months, significantly longer than the survival of patients treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Tumor extirpation was associated with a 10 month symptom-free survival, again significantly longer than that achieved by nonsurgical approaches. Complete resection was possible in one-third of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In four other studies with a combined experience of over 200 patients, the presenting symptom was relieved in 90 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-17</a>]. The median survival ranged from 8 to 13 months with a five-year survival of 10 to 18 percent. In the smaller subset of patients with successful complete resection, median survival ranged from 15 to 44 months with five-year survivals of up to 38 to 45 percent.</p><p/><p>In these studies, however, the patients selected for surgery were those who were more likely to be resectable than those who were selected for nonsurgical therapies. Similarly, patients selected for surgery are often in better general health than those who receive nonsurgical therapy. Nevertheless, resection is a reasonable option for a subset of symptomatic patients with good performance status and no other sites of metastatic disease; such patients may achieve good palliation and perhaps long-term survival. Major resections, such as gastrectomy or abdominoperineal resection, should be avoided, as metastases in these sites are less likely to be symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection is rarely indicated for melanoma involving the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hepatic resection is sometimes successful for isolated liver metastases from primary sites outside the gastrointestinal tract, including melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In general, however, liver metastases from cutaneous melanoma are rarely resectable for cure, median time to recurrence is quite short (&lt;6 months), and the prognosis is poor.</p><p>Resection of metastases to endocrine organs may provide palliation and prolong survival for symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In one report, 18 of 27 patients (67 percent) with adrenal metastases from melanoma were rendered disease free surgically; the median survival was 26 months following complete resection compared with nine months after palliative resection. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for metastatic disease is safe, effective, and associated with less morbidity than the open approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Second recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who successfully undergo complete resection of metastatic disease remain at high risk of a second recurrence. Further surgery may permit long-term disease-free survival in some of these patients. In a single institution series of 211 patients with metastatic melanoma who were surgically rendered free of disease, 62 percent developed a second recurrence, and the median recurrence-free interval was eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Although widespread metastatic disease usually develops in most cases, complete resection of metastatic disease is associated with prolonged (five-year) survival in up to 40 percent of cases.
