Men often develop bald areas on the front and the top of the scalp. Women often have thinning hair on the top of the scalp, but usually do not lose all of the hair there (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74652\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74652 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Another common cause of hair loss is called &quot;alopecia areata.&quot; This type of hair loss happens when the body's infection-fighting system gets confused and starts to attack the parts of the skin where hair grows. People with alopecia areata have big, usually round spots of hair missing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50613 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>There are many other reasons for hair loss. Some medical conditions and even some medicines can also cause hair loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470276300\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you are very bothered by your hair loss, or if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not sure why you are losing your hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your hair loss occurs suddenly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You also have itching or pain on your scalp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You also don't feel well or feel very tired</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470276307\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with hair loss do not need tests. But your doctor or nurse might do tests to make sure your hair loss is not caused by a hormonal problem or another medical condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470276314\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hair loss treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what type of hair loss you have.</p><p>If your hair loss is caused by a health problem, treating that problem can help. Other types of hair loss are treated with medicines that go on the scalp or that come in pills. Sometimes surgery is used to treat people with areas of hair that cannot grow back.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Androgenetic alopecia</strong> &ndash; These medicines can help hair regrow in people with androgenetic alopecia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Minoxidil</a> (brand name: Rogaine) &ndash; This medicine is used in men and women. You can buy it without a prescription. It comes in a liquid or foam that you put on your head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Finasteride</a> (brand name: Propecia) &ndash; This medicine is meant for men. Doctors sometimes also give it to women who have been through menopause (meaning they have stopped having periods). It comes in a pill, and you need a prescription to buy it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Spironolactone</a> (brand name: Aldactone) &ndash; This medicine can help hair regrow in some women who do not have good results with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">minoxidil</a>. It is not safe to use during pregnancy. Women who can get pregnant are often given birth control pills to prevent pregnancy while they are taking spironolactone. The medicine comes in a pill, and you need a prescription to buy it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alopecia areata</strong> &ndash; These are some examples of medicines that can help regrow hair in people with alopecia areata:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called steroids &ndash; These can be given as shots, or applied directly to the skin (for example, as a liquid, gel, foam, lotion, or cream). The medicine slows or stops the immune response that causes alopecia areata. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A treatment called &quot;topical immunotherapy&quot; &ndash; A dermatologist usually gives this type of treatment. The doctor puts a special medicine that causes a mild allergic reaction on the spots of hair loss. You usually need many treatments to see if topical immunotherapy will work.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470276321\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am upset about my hair loss?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Losing your hair can be very tough. If you feel sad or anxious because of your hair loss, speak to your doctor or nurse. He or she can help you get the support you need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470276328\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-in-men-and-women-androgenetic-alopecia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hair loss in men and women (androgenetic alopecia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alopecia-areata-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Alopecia areata (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
