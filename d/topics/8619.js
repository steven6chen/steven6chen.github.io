Both are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), and both have similar features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). However, there are several differences between these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have vasculitis associated with ANCA (ie, GPA and MPA) can also be distinguished according to the two most prominent ANCA serotypes, specifically, proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The ANCA serotype may have more prognostic significance than the terms &quot;MPA&quot; and &quot;GPA&quot; with respect to response to therapy, propensity for relapse, and patient outcome. In addition, genetic variants that are associated with ANCA disease are more specifically linked with the antigen (PR3 versus MPO) rather than with the clinical phenotype.

However, relapses are common, and some patients have frequent relapses. In addition, among patients who progress to end-stage renal disease, nonrenal relapses can occur in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis or renal transplantation, and renal manifestations can recur in the transplanted kidney.</p><p>Issues related to relapsing disease in patients with GPA or MPA will be reviewed here.

The most commonly used are monitoring of clinical status by the patient and clinician and monitoring of serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) titers. The goal is maintenance of complete remission, which is defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score <span class=\"nowrap\">(BVAS/GPA)</span> of zero. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Definition of complete remission'</a>.)</p><p>Relapses are common in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis who attain remission. The reported rates of relapse vary widely among studies, ranging from approximately 10 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/5-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-13</a>]. This wide range of reported relapse rates may be due at least in part to differences in initial or maintenance therapy, serotype (ie, proteinase-3 [PR3] versus myeloperoxidase [MPO]), the proportion of patients with GPA as compared with MPA, the duration of follow-up, and the criteria used to define relapse. The following examples are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a community-based cohort in which 258 patients attained remission, 109 (42 percent) relapsed. Patients who were anti-PR3 seropositive were nearly twice as likely to relapse as compared with patients who were anti-MPO seropositive, suggesting that patients with GPA are more likely to relapse than those with MPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

By contrast, the relapse rate was approximately 15 percent at 18 months in the CYCAZAREM trial, in which all patients were initially treated with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids to induce remission and then continued on glucocorticoid therapy after remission was achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition to the differences in therapy between these two trials, the WGET trial had a higher proportion of patients with GPA as compared with CYCAZAREM (39 versus 0 percent), a longer duration of follow-up (27 months in WGET and 18 months in CYCAZAREM), and a lower threshold for defining relapse (one minor manifestation in WGET compared with three minor manifestations in CYCAZAREM).

If there is recurrent hematuria, the urine should be tested again in four to seven days (since transient hematuria can occur from other causes), and, if the dipstick is still positive for heme, the patient should be evaluated without delay. </p><p>A potential confounding issue can occur in premenopausal women, who often have blood in the urine during menses due to contamination from menstrual bleeding. Short of bladder catheterization, the etiology of hematuria is best determined by repeat urinalysis after the cessation of menses. Thus, for premenopausal women, testing should be performed at least a few days after the cessation of menses. However, this problem is uncommon in patients with GPA or MPA since the mean age in affected patients is over 50 years, and therefore, most female patients are postmenopausal.

Changes in PR3-ANCA levels explained less than 10 percent of the variation in disease activity.

Infections are particularly important to exclude in patients with respiratory tract disease. It may be difficult, for example, to distinguish between active disease and infection (and some patients have both) in patients who develop manifestations limited to the upper respiratory tract, such as nasal ulcers and crusting. Endoscopic examination by an experienced ear, nose, and throat clinician may establish a definitive diagnosis but often shows only nonspecific acute and chronic inflammation.

Both hypoalbuminemia and edema are unusual, even when protein excretion exceeds 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with nonimmunologic progression should not have an active urinary sediment (eg, red cells and cellular casts) or other signs of disease activity; such findings usually indicate relapsing ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.

However, biopsy is not necessary if there is clear evidence of new active inflammation. As an example, biopsy is not warranted in a patient who presents with a new rise in the serum creatinine and recurrence of red blood cells and red cell casts in the urine sediment. Renal biopsy is also not indicated in patients who have a slow rise in serum creatinine and persistent or slowly increasing proteinuria without hematuria, which probably reflects nonimmunologic progression of previous injury.

Between 70 and 90 percent of patients with GPA or MPA attain clinical remission with initial immunosuppressive therapy (typically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in combination with glucocorticoids). They are then treated with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, usually with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, rituximab, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, for a period that is typically 12 to 18 months (or sometimes longer). However, relapses are common, and some patients have frequent relapses. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse is defined as the recurrence of signs or symptoms of active vasculitis in any organ system after remission is achieved. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition of relapsing disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of modalities have been used to monitor patients with GPA or MPA for relapse.

In some cases, relapse can be diagnosed clinically if the patient has systemic symptoms and the same organ involvement as the initial presentation. In other patients, tissue biopsy is required to verify recurrent vasculitis rather than other factors such as infection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of relapsing disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosing relapse of GPA or MPA is not always straightforward; respiratory infections and nonimmunologic progression of kidney disease, for example, can mimic some of the clinical features of vasculitis.
