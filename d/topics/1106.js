The most common cause of aphasia is cerebrovascular disease, particularly cerebral infarction. Aphasia complicates 15 to 38 percent of ischemic strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Other structural pathologies (infection, trauma, neoplasm) and certain neurodegenerative diseases (primary progressive aphasia) can also cause aphasia.</p><p>Aphasia can be a devastating condition and is one of the most feared consequences of cerebral infarction and other brain injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although quality of life in patients with aphasia is difficult to measure directly, the disruption in communication with its likely effects on employment status and social networks suggests that its impact can be profound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Caregivers of stroke survivors are likely to experience more stress when caring for a family member with, rather than without, aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Comprehension deficits can also limit rehabilitation efforts targeting other post-stroke deficits such as hemiparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Patients with post-stroke aphasia have greater morbidity and mortality than stroke patients without aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. While most, if not all, patients with post-stroke aphasia have some functional recovery, residual deficits are common. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence that therapeutic interventions are effective.</p><p>This topic reviews the prognosis and management of aphasia, focusing on post-stroke aphasia, which is the most common etiology. The evaluation of aphasia, the management of primary progressive aphasia and other aspects of stroke prognosis and management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with aphasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recovery from aphasia is influenced by lesion location and type of aphasia. As an example, large lesions in the left hemisphere with global aphasia have a much poorer recovery than small, subcortical lesions with anomia.</p><p>The prognosis for aphasia recovery depends in large part upon the underlying etiology. This has been best studied in cerebrovascular disease. Most patients with post-stroke aphasia improve to some extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1-4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,14,15</a>]. Most improvement occurs within the first few months and plateaus after one year. The severity of the initial aphasia strongly correlates with the long-term deficit; those with milder degrees of aphasia at onset are the most likely to recover completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. In one study of post-stroke aphasia, baseline phonology was the linguistic component that was most predictive of recovery at one year; other factors associated with good one year outcomes were younger age, higher Barthel Index, higher educational level and hemorrhagic (as opposed to ischemic) stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with significant aphasia may benefit from intensive treatment regimens even after the period of spontaneous recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Smaller studies in patients with aphasia resulting from traumatic brain injury indicate that the clinical course is similar to post-stroke aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrate that early recovery after stroke (in the first few days and weeks) is related to reperfusion of language areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22</a>]. Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that subsequent improvement is associated with increased activation of contiguous areas in the perisylvian language areas as well as homologous brain regions in the right hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-32</a>].</p><p>Patients with aphasia resulting from right hemisphere lesions often have less severe permanent language deficits, likely as a consequence of incomplete language lateralization in these individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with aphasia&quot;, section on 'Cerebral dominance'</a>.) While there is some evidence to suggest that left-handed individuals with left hemisphere stroke and women have less complete lateralization of language dominance than right-handed individuals and men, neither handedness nor gender have consistently been shown to impact recovery from post-stroke aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4,15,16,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,16,33</a>]. Similarly, increased age has not been consistently shown to influence prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying cause of the aphasia should be treated specifically, whether it is degenerative, vascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, or epileptic (see appropriate topic reviews).</p><p>Aphasia resulting from an intraparenchymal mass or hematoma, or from an extra-axial mass or fluid collection, may improve dramatically with removal of the offending mass. In the case of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, treatment of edema with steroids may result in rapid improvement, but worsening of the neoplastic disease is likely to be accompanied by recurrence of aphasia.</p><p>Episodes of aphasia resulting from epileptic seizures should resolve with adequate anticonvulsant therapy. The treatment of acquired epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) is problematic, and children with this disease may be left with permanent linguistic dysfunction, particularly auditory comprehension defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Syndromes with electrical status epilepticus during sleep'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech and language therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aphasia may resolve spontaneously, especially when it is caused by a small ischemic lesion, but in most cases, a speech-language pathologist is consulted to assist the patient in recovering linguistic abilities and to train the patient and family members in alternative strategies for communication. The available data from clinical trials offer weak support for this approach, but no single technique has emerged as more effective than others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/30,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35,36</a>]. Challenges in studying the use of speech and language therapy include the heterogeneity of aphasia syndromes, the wide variety and lack of standardized techniques employed in speech and language therapy, as well as the fact that many patients improve spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The actual speech-language rehabilitation technique may not matter as much as the actual number and intensity of therapy. </p><p>One review of 10 studies of 864 patients with post-stroke aphasia found that intense (in excess of two hours per week) speech and language therapy over a short period of time was more effective than less intense therapy provided over a longer period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, a subsequent randomized study in 116 patients found that in the subacute setting, patients who received two hours of therapy per week had similar recoveries compared to those who received five hours of therapy a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Study results have also differed as to whether similar or disparate benefits are expected from professional therapists versus community-based programs or trained family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. While some have found that language therapy works best when administered early after stroke, others have found that, after adjusting for the effects of early spontaneous recovery, similar gains can be attained when speech therapy is administered in more chronic stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/37,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41,42</a>].</p><p>Newer language therapy techniques that are being studied include the use of computer-assisted techniques, as well as so-called constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) (high intensity therapy that restricts the use of nonverbal communication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. In one study of 27 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia, CIAT produced benefits both when used alone and when combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic approaches'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Developments are also being made in the application of augmentive and alternative communication devices. The recent development of smarter phones, computer pads, and similar devices has led to the availability of downloadable applications for therapy and communication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale behind pharmacologic treatment of aphasia involves replacing depleted neurotransmitters, enhancing neuroplasticity, and improving cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. No pharmacological intervention has been proven to result unequivocally in long-term benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Examples of clinical trials of medications in patients with post-stroke aphasia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bromocriptine</a> was studied in a randomized, double-blind trial in 38 patients with a post-stroke nonfluent aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After 16 weeks of treatment, there was no difference in the recovery of language function between active and placebo-treated groups. This negative result was concurrent with the results of a previous randomized study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amphetamine in conjunction with <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> therapy (10 sessions over five weeks) appeared to improve language more than therapy alone in a randomized, double-blind study in 21 post-stroke aphasia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The between-group differences appeared to be maintained at the six-week and six-month assessments but were no longer significant after six-months. A 2003 systematic review of the use of amphetamines in post-stroke rehabilitation concluded that the aggregated results of small studies supported future research of this treatment approach, but not their use in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Piracetam was studied in 24 stroke patients with aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. After six weeks of treatment, the piracetam-treated group appeared to make greater gains in language function on certain subtest areas compared with the placebo-treated group. A meta-analysis of prior studies of piracetam in acute stroke concluded that there was weak evidence of piracetam's efficacy in the treatment of post-stroke aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=galantamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">galantamine</a> have shown promise in open-label studies in patients with post-stroke aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,53,54</a>]. There is some evidence that donepezil and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be efficacious in vascular dementia and also in aphasia resulting from neurodegenerative dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of vascular dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Memantine</a> (10 mg twice daily) was studied along with constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) in 27 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia in a randomized, controlled, parallel-group study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Memantine treatment was associated with a sustained benefit at 48 weeks on measures of aphasia and communication. The benefit of drug treatment appeared to be augmented by CIAT.</p><p/><p>Depression often develops in patients with chronic or progressive aphasias and may impair aphasia recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Psychotherapy or pharmacological management may improve the outcome in these patients. However, a six-month clinical trial of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moclobemide-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moclobemide</a>, in 90 unselected patients with post-stroke aphasia did not find that treatment was associated with greater improvement of the aphasia compared to placebo treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The use of prophylactic antidepressant medications is not supported in patients with post-stroke aphasia or aphasia of other etiologies. It seems reasonable, however, to monitor such patients for the development of depression and institute treatment if depression does emerge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of late-life unipolar depression&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied to the contralateral, unaffected cerebral hemisphere, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is believed to suppress its activity, and as a result, the tonic inhibition of the affected hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While uncontrolled reports in a small number of patients with post-stroke aphasia and a limited number of small controlled trials report evidence of efficacy, further study of this modality is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. A small, placebo-controlled study of TMS in 10 patients with Alzheimer disease suggested a benefit from treatment in auditory sentence comprehension but not other test measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Another randomized study of 24 patients with subacute poststroke aphasia, found that 10 sessions of repetitive TMS followed by 45 minutes of speech and language therapy was associated with improved language recovery compared to sham-treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Persistent benefit at three months as measured by the Concise Chinese Aphasia test score was found in a subsequent randomized study in 45 poststroke aphasia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>An alternative approach applies a weak polarizing electric current to the cortex using electrodes applied to the skull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

In another nonrandomized study in eight patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia, cortical stimulation applied via surgically implanted electrodes appeared to augment the effect of speech and language therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>This treatment is also being evaluated in patients with primary progressive aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
