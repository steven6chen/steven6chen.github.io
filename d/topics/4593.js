PKD may be inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The autosomal dominant form (ADPKD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The majority of individuals with PKD eventually require renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The course and treatment of ADPKD in adults are discussed here.

ADPKD is the underlying cause of kidney disease in approximately 5 percent of patients who initiate dialysis annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>ADPKD is caused by two known (and possibly more unknown) genetic mutations: <em>PKD1</em> (which encodes polycystin-1) on chromosome 16 and <em>PKD2</em> (which encodes polycystin-2) on chromosome 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Among all PKD cases, <em>PKD1</em> mutations are more common (approximately 71 to 85 percent) than <em>PKD2</em> mutations (approximately 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, approximately 6.8 percent of patients do not reveal any of these genetic mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The relative frequency of <em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em> mutations depends on the age of the population being studied since patients with <em>PKD2</em> mutations present at an older age and progress more slowly than patients with <em>PKD1</em> mutations. As a result, <em>PKD2</em> mutations may be underreported compared with <em>PKD1</em> and the frequency of <em>PKD2</em> underestimated among populations in which only symptomatic individuals are tested. This is demonstrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>PKD1</em> mutations were present in 85 percent, <em>PKD2</em> mutation in 15 percent in studies of patients who had known PKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since patients with <em>PKD1</em> reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or die at a younger age compared with those with <em>PKD2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], studies of older patients with ADPKD demonstrate a higher proportion of disease attributable to <em>PKD2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>].

The age at which affected individuals have clinical manifestations such as renal failure or hypertension is variable. As discussed above, patients with <em>PKD1</em> present with symptoms at a younger age than those with <em>PKD2</em>. In one study, the median age of patients who presented with renal failure was 54 and 74 years for those with <em>PKD1</em> and <em>PKD2</em>, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The association between kidney volume and declining GFR was demonstrated in CRISP, which reported that baseline kidney volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predicted the rate of kidney growth and decrease in function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/19,20,49,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,49,52</a>]. Height-adjusted kidney size appears to best predict the decline in GFR, with a height-adjusted kidney volume &gt;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/m</span> being a better predictor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 (estimated GFR [eGFR] &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) by eight years than age, baseline serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, although useful for risk stratification in clinical trials, the ability to measure total kidney size by MRI is not widely available. However, the measurement of kidney length by ultrasound or MRI may be used with similar strength to predict the risk of CKD. Data from CRISP showed that kidney length &gt;16.5 cm by ultrasound strongly predicts the risk of CKD by eight years with area under receiver operating curve of 0.88 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>An imaging classification was developed for PKD and validated on the CRISP cohort participants. This classification system categorized patients into five prognostic classes (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E) for disease progression. The model includes total kidney volume (TKV), age, and height to characterize the ADPKD classification. By adding this classification to the parameters of eGFR (age, gender, race, and serum creatinine), the model predicted future eGFR in time. The frequency of ESRD at 10 years increased from subclass 1A (2.4 percent) to 1E (66.9 percent) in the Mayo cohort and from 1C (2.2 percent) to 1E (22.3 percent) in the younger CRISP cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

In support of this hypothesis, the early, but not late, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> inhibited mTOR signaling, cyst formation, and fibrosis in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> may have inhibited compensatory hypertrophy, which usually preserves GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The latter explanation suggests that everolimus may exert a protective effect over the long term, but the duration of this study was too short to demonstrate such an effect. Importantly, the known nephrotoxicity of the mTOR inhibitors, as evidenced by increasing levels of proteinuria that are independent of cyst formation and expansion, renders it difficult to establish the benefits of mTOR inhibition based on reduced changes in TKV.</p><p>The lack of effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> on kidney volume at 18 months is potentially attributable to the low target drug level, which was much lower than those associated with a beneficial effect in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) is caused by mutations of <em>PKD1</em> or <em>PKD2</em>. <em>PKD1</em> mutations are more common and cause more severe disease than <em>PKD2</em> mutations. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ADPKD from either <em>PKD1</em> or <em>PKD2</em> mutations present with hypertension, hematuria, renal insufficiency, or flank pain attributable to renal hemorrhage, calculi, or urinary tract infection. Patients may also present with symptoms that are secondary to cysts in other organs such as the liver or pancreas. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal function usually remains normal until the fourth decade. Thereafter glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines on average by 4.4 to 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Course and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic contribution to severity of disease includes the gene mutation (<em>PKD1</em> versus <em>PKD2</em>). Other clinical risk factors associated with progressive renal disease include hypertension, early onset of symptoms, male gender, and increased renal size. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Course and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension occurs early, prior to loss of kidney function, in close to two-thirds of patients with ADPKD and is associated with progressive renal disease. Issues related to goal blood pressure in these patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure goal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Reduction of CHD risk in patients with CKD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may, in addition to lowering the blood pressure, slow the rate of progression of ADPKD, especially among patients with proteinuria. For patients who have no contraindications to an ACE inhibitor (such as pregnancy), we suggest using an ACE inhibitor as the initial antihypertensive agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H3984957\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Choice of agent'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific therapy has been approved to prevent or delay progression of ADPKD. Promising specific therapies that are being evaluated include vasopressin receptor antagonists and increasing fluid intake to suppress plasma vasopressin levels. Early usage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> in the pediatric ADPKD population may slow the progression of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Vasopressin receptor antagonists'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Increased fluid intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ADPKD and renal failure are most commonly treated with hemodialysis or undergo renal transplantation with equivalent or better overall outcomes compared with non-ADPKD patients. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Renal replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Patel V, Chowdhury R, Igarashi P.
