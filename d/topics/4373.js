MODS exists in a continuum with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which affects most patients with a severe burn, with or without an infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. The risk of MODS increases with burn wounds &gt;20 percent total body surface area (TBSA), increasing age, male gender, sepsis, hypoperfusion, and under-resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].

The ebb state is one of low cardiac output. The flow state is hyperdynamic, in which patients have significantly elevated heart rates and cardiac outputs. These cardiac perturbations occur in nearly all patients with a &ge;40 percent TBSA burn.

At 72 to 96 hours postburn, cardiac output was 150 percent higher than predicted for healthy adults, and remained abnormal at the time of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The heart rate was 160 to 170 percent higher than predicted and remained elevated for up to two years post burn.

Under-resuscitation followed by over-resuscitation leads to pulmonary edema and right heart failure. In infants, right heart failure is a common contributor to burn-related death. Infant hearts may be less compliant, and low filling pressures may plateau stroke volumes, thereby causing the heart to be more sensitive to volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/21,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,35</a>].

Immediately following a severe burn and continuing for approximately one week, generalized edema and hepatic hypertrophy occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In a retrospective review of 102 severely burned children, the mean liver size and weight increased during the first week and peaked at two weeks following the burn (mean &plusmn; standard error, 85&plusmn;5 percent and 126&plusmn;19 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Twelve months after the burn, the liver remained 50 percent larger than the predicted liver size.</p><p>Hepatic protein synthesis is also impaired after a severe burn. As a result of the cellular damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered membrane permeability, hepatic edema induces an increased release of hepatic enzymes into the circulation. Elevated circulating levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutamate dehydrogenase, or alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) are reliable indicators of hepatocyte injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/29,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,40,41</a>]. However, ALT is a more specific test for hepatocyte injury following a severe burn. Serum levels of the circulating enzymes as high as 200 percent above normal for age have been reported for patients with severe burns. </p><p>Serum markers peak early following a severe burn; AST and ALT peak during the first postburn day, and ALKP during the second day, and often normalize prior to discharge. Although these enzymes are elevated as a direct result of the burn injury, additional physiologic processes may be amplifying their expression, including the elevation of ALKP occurring during growth spurts or alongside massive bone resorption. Treatment of acute hepatic failure is supportive, and may include replacement of factors II, VII, IX, and X and albumen until the liver recovers. Management of acute liver failure is discussed separately. Prothrombin time (PT) is a useful marker of hepatic synthetic function, and specifically coagulation. Coupled with the clinical examination, PT can be helpful in the interpretation of other serum liver function tests, especially if abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-outcomes-of-a-severe-burn/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].
