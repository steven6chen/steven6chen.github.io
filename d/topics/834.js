Most commonly caused by local trauma, anal fissures cause pain during defecation that persists for one to two hours. Persistence of an anal fissure is typically associated with anal spasm or high anal pressure. Medical management is typically used as the initial treatment for an anal fissure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Surgery is reserved for patients who fail medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Surgical modalities of anal fissure treatment, including lateral internal sphincterotomy and botulinum toxin injection, are discussed in this topic. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, prevention, and medical management of anal fissure are discussed elsewhere.

Patients who are willing to undergo surgical treatment are further triaged based upon their risk of fecal incontinence. Women who have had multiple vaginal deliveries and older patients may have a weak anal sphincter complex, which puts them at a high risk of developing fecal incontinence after surgical treatment of anal fissure. Such patients should undergo one of the procedures that do not require division of the anal sphincter muscle (eg, botulinum toxin injection, fissurectomy, or anal advancement flap). Other patients who are not at risk of developing fecal incontinence may undergo lateral internal sphincterotomy, which is considered the most effective treatment for anal fissure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82392\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82392 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25643490\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with low risk of incontinence: Sphincterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lateral internal sphincterotomy provides prompt symptomatic relief and heals anal fissures in over 95 percent of patients within three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>]. In patients who are at a low risk of developing fecal incontinence, the lateral internal sphincterotomy is the gold standard for the operative management of an anal fissure secondary to hypertonicity or hypertrophy of the internal anal sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. As the gold standard, lateral internal sphincterotomy has been compared with all other therapies for anal fissure, including topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>], botulinum toxin A injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>], and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lateral internal sphincterotomy remains superior in its efficacy to all other therapies, according to a 2012 systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A Lord's, or four-finger, dilatation in the operating room had been previously used for the treatment of anal fissures before lateral sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although this treatment can improve the spasm in the internal anal sphincter, it is associated with a high incidence of sphincter tears and fecal incontinence and therefore has been abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Pneumatic balloon dilation has also been performed for treatment of chronic anal fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, experience is limited, and it has not been compared directly with other approaches. A midline posterior sphincterotomy was found to be inferior to lateral internal sphincterotomy and is rarely performed because it can result in a &quot;keyhole deformity&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25643740\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous antibiotics are <strong>not</strong> generally required for patients undergoing a sphincterotomy.

The choice of anesthesia is determined by both patient and surgeon preference, although a retrospective study of 298 patients reported a higher rate of fissure recurrence after a lateral internal sphincterotomy performed under local, as opposed to general, anesthesia (9 of 20 versus 23 of 271) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25641404\"><span class=\"h4\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positioning options for lateral internal sphincterotomy include the prone jackknife, lithotomy, and lateral decubitus positions. The location of the fissure does <strong>not</strong> influence the choice of patient positioning. We prefer to place the patient in a prone jackknife position. Morbidly obese patients are typically placed in the lateral decubitus position, since they frequently do not tolerate the prone jackknife or lithotomy position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25641411\"><span class=\"h3\">Operative technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the patient is properly positioned, gentle anal dilation is performed to allow admittance of a medium (0.75 to 1 inch [1.90 to 2.54 cm]) rectal retractor. Anoscopy is performed using the rectal retractor. The internal sphincter muscle is then divided at a lateral position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H937894\"><span class=\"h4\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure can be performed in either an open or a closed manner at the surgeon's discretion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the open technique, the surgeon incises the anoderm to expose the internal sphincter muscle and divides it under direct vision. Complete division of the internal sphincter muscle fibers is important since an incompletely divided internal sphincter has been associated with a marked increase in fissure recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H6292684\" class=\"local\">'Incomplete sphincterotomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the closed technique, the surgeon inserts a blade either directly under the anoderm or into the intersphincteric groove and divides the internal sphincter without widely incising the anal mucosa.</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of five randomized trials with 299 patients found no significant difference between the two techniques in terms of the rate of healing or incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the largest trial of 79 patients, the rate of fissure healing was 96 percent at six weeks, and new incontinence was diagnosed in five patients (6.8 percent) at 52 weeks for open and closed procedures combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H937913\"><span class=\"h4\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the method chosen, most surgeons perform a <strong>lateral</strong> internal sphincterotomy. We typically perform the sphincterotomy on the <strong>right</strong> side between the anterior and posterior hemorrhoidal columns to avoid confusion if a repeat procedure is required. A posterior sphincterotomy is rarely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H937925\"><span class=\"h4\">Extent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of the sphincterotomy remains controversial. We recommend performing a longer lateral internal anal sphincterotomy rather than the tailored or partial sphincterotomy (fissure apex sphincterotomy) as described here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The longer sphincterotomy divides the internal anal sphincter muscle to the level of or just proximal to the dentate line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tailored or partial sphincterotomy divides the internal anal sphincter only to the level of the apex of the fissure and therefore is also referred to as the &quot;fissure apex sphincterotomy.&quot; Compared with the longer sphincterotomy, this approach preserves more sphincteric muscle fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/10,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30</a>].</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of three randomized trials with a total of 320 patients found that the longer sphincterotomy resulted in a significantly higher rate of fissure healing (odds ratio [OR] 6.7, 95% CI 1.4-33.3) compared with the fissure apex sphincterotomy, and there was no difference in the incontinence rates between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The actual fissure may or may not be excised at the time of a lateral sphincterotomy at the surgeon's discretion, but a biopsy should be performed if the fissure has an atypical appearance. (See <a href=\"#H17932834\" class=\"local\">'Atypical anal fissure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H302558719\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infiltration of the operative site with a local anesthetic before <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after the sphincterotomy will provide postoperative pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Oral narcotics can be used as primary postoperative analgesia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly intramuscular or intravenous agents, improve analgesia, lower narcotic usage, and lower the rate of urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Since a bladder catheter is not typically used, limiting perioperative fluid administration to less than one liter lowers the incidence of postoperative urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Postoperative instructions include recommendations for sitz baths for comfort, adequate intake of fluid and fiber to avoid constipation, and limited activity for a few days. These instructions are primarily derived from clinical experience, rather than specific data. With appropriate postoperative instruction, a lateral sphincterotomy can be performed with a high degree of patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938325\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of fecal incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major concern with surgery for anal fissures is the risk of fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/10,14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,24</a>]. Fecal incontinence can be characterized as either minor (defined as inadvertent escape of flatus or partial soiling of undergarments with liquid stool) or major (involuntary excretion of feces). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lateral internal sphincterotomy can cause long-term (&ge;2 years) incontinence of both flatus and stool. In a meta-analysis of 22 retrospective and prospective studies that included 4512 patients who were followed for &ge;2 years after a lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure, the overall continence disturbance rate was 14 percent, which included flatus incontinence in 9 percent, <span class=\"nowrap\">soilage/seepage</span> in 6 percent, accidental defecation in 0.91 percent, incontinence to liquid stool in 0.67 percent, and incontinence to solid stool in 0.83 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Others estimate that 30 to 45 percent of patients experience minor fecal incontinence immediately following lateral internal sphincterotomy, with 6 to 30 percent of patients having persistent symptoms long-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27</a>]. By contrast, only approximately 2 percent of the general population suffers from fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The risk is increased in women, particularly those who have had previous vaginal deliveries. In one study of 487 patients, women were significantly more likely to develop fecal incontinence after a sphincterotomy than men (53 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3496754\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with high risk of incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are at a high risk of developing fecal incontinence (eg, multiparous women or older patients), options for surgical management of anal fissure include botulinum toxin A injection, V-Y advancement flap, and subcutaneous fissurectomy. These alternatives to lateral sphincterotomy do not require the internal sphincter muscle to be divided and thereby reduce the risk of fecal incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935885\"><span class=\"h3\">Botulinum toxin injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum toxin is a potent inhibitor of the release of acetylcholine from nerve endings and has been used successfully for decades to treat certain spastic disorders of skeletal muscle such as blepharospasm and torticollis. It has also been used to treat spastic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract such as achalasia and anal fissure.</p><p>Injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter can help relax the hypertonic anal sphincter muscle and, in turn, improve healing of chronic anal fissures. A commercially prepared form of botulinum toxin type A (eg, Botox, Dysport) is typically given as injections around the anal canal. Dosages (ranging from 10 to 100 units) vary depending upon the specific brand and preparation of the botulinum toxin that is used.</p><p>In one protocol, 10 units of Botox (0.2 mL of 50 units per mL) each are injected into the internal anal sphincter on either side of the anal fissure with a 27-gauge needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In a trial of 30 patients with chronic anal fissures, botulinum toxin injection using this protocol resulted in significantly more fissure healing than saline control at one (8 of 15 versus 2 of 15) and two months (11 of 15 versus 2 of 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The four patients who had persistent fissures two months after botulinum toxin injection were retreated, and all healed by two months thereafter. One patient developed temporary flatus incontinence after Botox injection. No relapse occurred during an average follow-up of 16 months.</p><p>Other studies with longer follow-ups, however, found recurrence rates of 40 to 50 percent after botulinum toxin treatment of anal fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Patients who relapse may be retreated with botulinum toxin with good results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Temporary fecal incontinence after botulinum toxin therapy has been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 7 percent, which compares favorably with the 30 to 45 percent of patients who experience minor fecal incontinence following lateral sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>In a Cochrane meta-analysis, botulinum toxin injection was found to be equally efficacious in treating chronic anal fissures as topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, because botulinum toxin is more invasive and is associated with a greater risk of mild incontinence, we generally reserve it for patients who have not responded to first-line medical therapy with one of the topical vasodilators.

In a study of 53 patients whose chronic anal fissures were successfully treated with fissurectomy, only five patients (11 percent) recurred with a five-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Fissurectomy did not affect the rate of fecal incontinence.</p><p>Fissurectomy has also been performed in conjunction with botulinum toxin injection to treat anal fissures. In two studies, such combination treatment resulted in fissure healing rates of 67 to 83 percent, minor incontinence rates of 3 to 7 percent, and fissure recurrence rates of 0 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3495872\"><span class=\"h3\">Anal advancement flap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anal advancement flap, such as the endoanal V-Y advancement flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63328\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63328 \">figure 2</a>), does not divide the internal sphincter and is not associated with any increased risk of fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. It is an alternative to the lateral internal sphincterotomy for patients who are at risk of developing fecal incontinence (eg, older adults, multiparous women, recurrent fissures), especially for those whose fissures are not related to hypertonicity of the sphincter muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/49,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,51-54</a>].

The patient evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination focusing on secondary manifestations of a systemic disease, wound cultures to identify a possible infection, and an examination under anesthesia with biopsies to rule out malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

As an example, patients with anal fissures due to Crohn proctitis should be referred to a gastroenterologist for optimal management of their Crohn disease. Anal fissures related to Crohn disease are multiple in approximately one-third of patients. These fissures are usually painless. Thus, excessive rectal pain in a patient with Crohn-related anal fissures should raise suspicion for development of a perirectal abscess and prompt an examination under anesthesia and possibly a drainage procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Because sphincter preservation is important for patients who often have chronic diarrhea, anal fissures in Crohn patients are typically treated medically rather than surgically. A lateral sphincterotomy is reserved for Crohn patients with minimal active anorectal inflammation who fail all available nonsurgical therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-surgical-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].
