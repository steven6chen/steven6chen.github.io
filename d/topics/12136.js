Patients with large varicose veins or complications of varicose veins are often best managed with open surgical techniques. Available techniques are chosen based upon the location, size, and extent of the patient's varicosities, and presence or absence of venous reflux.</p><p>Open surgical techniques for lower extremity vein ablation will be reviewed here. Alternative treatment approaches to the treatment of chronic venous disease using cutaneous laser, sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and endovenous laser ablation are discussed separately. Increasingly, varicose veins are treated with hybrid procedures that combine conventional surgical with minimally invasive techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy of lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liquid, foam, and glue sclerotherapy techniques for the treatment of lower extremity veins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candidates for surgical ablation are patients with persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> of venous disease after a minimum of three months of medical therapy and documented reflux (ie, retrograde flow &gt;0.5 second duration) as a source of their symptoms.

Surgical treatment may also be combined with less invasive treatment options in selected patients to reduce the number of treatments needed.

For patients with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities, techniques that use local or regional anesthetic are preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Ablation of superficial varicosities is contraindicated if the superficial system represents the dominant venous outflow as in cases of deep vein obstruction or congenital absence of the deep venous system. In patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis, varicose vein surgery should be undertaken with caution because of the risk of perioperative venous thrombosis. </p><p>Diabetes and moderate-to-severe peripheral artery disease are relative contraindications because these conditions are associated with an increased risk of non-healing wounds. When arterial and venous diseases are both identified, the arterial disease should usually be addressed first. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major superficial veins of the lower extremity include the great and small saphenous veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019%7EPC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 graphicRef52340 \">figure 1A-B</a>). These and the saphenous accessory veins are collectively referred to as axial veins. The great saphenous vein joins the common femoral vein at the confluence of the superficial inguinal veins via the saphenofemoral junction. The small saphenous vein has more variable anatomy, especially with respect to the location of the saphenopopliteal junction.

They are located anteriorly, posteriorly, laterally and medially in the thigh and calf.</p><p>Bicuspid valves in the venous system direct flow in the superficial and deep veins from distal to proximal. With the exception of the foot, flow in the perforating veins is directed from superficial to deep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic venous disease&quot;, section on 'Normal venous anatomy and physiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Saphenous nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The saphenous nerve is the terminal branch of the femoral nerve and provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the lower leg. It passes through the adductor canal in proximity to the superficial femoral artery, after which it becomes closely related to the saphenous vein. The saphenous nerve is most vulnerable to injury in the calf, where it becomes adherent to the saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Surgical site infections occur at a higher rate in patients with open cutaneous wounds or venous stasis ulcers. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below.)</p><p>In one randomized trial, antibiotic prophylaxis prior to great saphenous vein excision significantly improved postoperative ASEPSIS scores compared with controls (3 versus 6), and reduced other wound-related problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In this trial, specific patient factors, including obesity and current cigarette smoking, were associated with higher ASEPSIS scores. Factors such as diabetes and corticosteroid use were not able to be evaluated. A late retrospective cohort study lack of antibiotic prophylaxis increased the risk for surgical site infection (most located in the groin); diabetes was a significant contributing risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Minimizing the duration of the surgical procedure (eg, less than 45 minutes), use of local anesthetic that allows muscular contractions during the operation, and early postoperative ambulation reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.</p><p>Patients with a known thrombophilia, or those at high risk for venous thromboembolism should receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and counseled regarding the increased risk of bleeding. In a review that compared different regimens in 2196 patients undergoing high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein, there were no differences in the incidence of venous thromboembolism between those who received pharmacologic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidences of postoperative deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were significantly higher in the group that did not receive prophylaxis (DVT: 5.17 versus 0.36 to 0.56 percent; PE: 1.48 versus 0 percent). Bleeding complications were low for each group but significantly higher in the group that received unfractionated compared with the groups that received low molecular weight heparin (0.75 versus 0.17 and 0.18 percent) or no prophylaxis (0.75 versus 0.18 percent).

A less than optimal cosmetic result may also occur due to hyperpigmentation and telangiectatic matting. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Complications of surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Alternatives, either alone or in combination, to surgical ablation include compression therapy, endovenous ablation, or sclerotherapy. In the United States, there are no effective medications available for the treatment of superficial venous insufficiency.

However, randomized trials have not found a benefit to wearing compression stockings with respect to postoperative pain, complications, return to work, or patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. A systematic review identified four trials evaluating the use of compression stockings following varicose vein surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. No significant differences were found between short duration (3 to 10 days) versus longer duration (3 to 6 weeks) compression with respect to postoperative pain (three trials), leg volume (one trial), incidence of complications (two trials), and absenteeism from work (three trials). &#160;</p><p>When elected, patients are prescribed Class II or higher compression stockings (eg, thigh-high or pantyhose), which they should obtain prior to the day of the scheduled procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74574 \">table 2</a>). A variety of nonprescription elastic compression stockings, shorts, and pants (eg, &quot;cycling&quot; shorts, &quot;running&quot; stockings, &quot;dance&quot; hose) have been marketed for a wide range of athletes and may offer an alternative form of postoperative compression for some patients. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative instructions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=compression-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-venous-insufficiency#H11314003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Compression therapy for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Compression hosiery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein mapping/marking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the patient standing, the veins that are to be removed are mapped (ie, marked with indelible ink) prior to the procedure. Patients should actively participate in this process to ensure that all the veins that concern them have been addressed. Near-infrared (IR) imaging using a wavelength of 880 nm to 930 nm may improve the accuracy of vein identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Failure to accurately mark the location of varicose veins can lead to the inability to locate the collapsed varicosities with the patient in the supine position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57470073\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical vein removal is typically performed in the outpatient setting using local, regional, or general anesthesia, depending upon the magnitude of the procedure, surgeon experience, and patient preference. Light sedation can be achieved with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, and for most procedures (eg, saphenous vein removal), a dilute anesthetic mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> can be injected subcutaneously along the course of the marked veins to achieve a peau d'orange appearance to reduce perioperative pain and improve hemostasis; this is referred to as tumescent anesthesia. For small areas of varicosities, oral sedatives combined with local anesthesia provide sufficient pain control during the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57470085\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical techniques involve ligation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> removal of veins; the specific method chosen is based upon the location, size, and extent of the patient's varicosities, and presence or absence of venous reflux. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57470044\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer to perform surgical vein removal on one leg at a time because bilateral surgery is often not well tolerated. </p><p>As an alternative to moving the patient to and from an operating room table, the author performs the procedure on a standard hospital gurney with the foot of the bed elevated. In doing so, the leg can remain elevated throughout the procedure and recovery period, which reduces bleeding. </p><p>For saphenous vein stripping, the groin hair is trimmed to facilitate exposure of the saphenofemoral junction, and placement and adhesion of the postoperative dressing. The lower extremity is prepared circumferentially from the anterior superior iliac spine to the level of the ankle. Alcohol-containing skin preparation should be avoided because it can remove skin markings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Venous ulcerations, if present, are prepared last with a separate prep kit. The wounds are cleansed, dried, and covered with an occlusive dressing to limit transmission of microbes to the remainder of the operative field. Portions of the extremity that are affected with ulceration should be draped out of the sterile field.</p><p>Blood loss during surgical removal of large varicosities can occasionally be significant, and the need for transfusion has been reported. Bleeding can be significantly reduced by elevation of the lower extremity during the procedure.</p><p>Alternatively, it has been proposed that tourniquets (eg, Esmarch, Lofquist cuff, Rhys-Davis Cuff) may be used during varicose vein surgery to reduce blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In our experience, tourniquets have not been necessary. A systematic review identified three randomized trials each supporting significantly decreased blood loss with the use of a tourniquet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because of the small number of patients in each trial, and expected rarity of complications, no conclusions were drawn with respect to any potential complications (eg, nerve injury) from the use of the tourniquet. In addition, if the tourniquet is used improperly, it can increase the bleeding by inducing venous hypertension or lead to flow stagnation leading to deep vein thrombosis. A retrospective review of 1461 patients who underwent varicose vein surgery where a tourniquet was routinely used identified deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 7.7 percent (1.3 percent proximal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Once the procedure is completed, a sterile class II compression stocking that completely covers the surgical site is placed directly on the leg. A layer of gauze is then used followed by an outer elastic wrap (eg, Ace wrap). The patient may ambulate immediately. The dressing is left in place for 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Compression stockings'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Saphenous vein inversion and removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small transverse incision is made over the saphenofemoral junction, which is usually located 2 to 3 cm distal and lateral to the pubic tubercle. Ultrasound may be used preoperatively to mark the precise location. The junction of the great saphenous vein with the common femoral vein (ie, saphenofemoral junction) is identified and isolated. Anteromedial and posterolateral tributaries are ligated and divided; however, tributaries draining the abdominal wall are preserved. In one trial, preservation of the abdominal wall tributaries was associated with lower rates of clinical and ultrasound-detected varicose vein recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>The great saphenous vein is divided, and the proximal end ligated near its junction with the common femoral vein. It is probably unnecessary, and possibly unwise, to ligate the saphenous vein flush with the common femoral vein. High ligation may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and late varicose vein recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The vein stripper is passed retrograde through the open end of the divided vein distally toward the foot. Due to the incompetence of the vein valves, the stripper should pass easily. A small skin incision is made over the tip of the stripper, which is palpated through the skin, usually near the knee joint. After incising the skin, a forceps is used to grasp the stripper and pull it through the incision. </p><p>In the groin, the stripper is securely tied to the vein. The authors prefer not to use the mushroom tips supplied with the typical stripper because excessive tissue trauma and bleeding can result. The vein inverts on itself and the vein is removed by pulling the stripper distally. Tributary veins that are tethering the vein can be disrupted using a percussion strike on the skin with four fingers as the stripper advances. Once hemostasis is achieved by direct pressure along the vein bed, the groin incision is closed in two layers with interrupted, absorbable suture.</p><p>A similar procedure can be used to strip the small saphenous vein. Care must be taken to avoid injury to the adjacent sural nerve. </p><p>Cryostripping is a variation of traditional saphenous stripping and is limited to the treatment of the great saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A specialized instrument is placed at the level of the previously ligated and divided saphenous vein, and supercooled. The vein freezes adhering to the device and is removed as the device is pulled out. The reported advantage of this method is potentially reduced postoperative bruising compared with conventional techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; however, randomized trials have failed to show any significant benefits in late outcomes (residual varicose veins, neovascularization) for cryostripping compared with open surgery or endovenous laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">High saphenous ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ligation of the saphenous vein at the saphenofemoral junction alone, without vein removal, is not usually performed due to the high rate of recurrent varicose veins and persistent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>].

The device is similar to devices used by orthopedic surgeons to shave off cartilage. The device consists of a long, narrow tube that has a rotating blade at its tip to macerate and aspirate the target vein. An illuminator (light source) is placed into the subcutaneous tissue through a counterincision to improve visualization of the target veins through the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Following the administration of tumescent anesthesia, which is a mixture of saline, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, the device is inserted adjacent the path of the target vein. The blade is activated and the vein is aspirated into the device and destroyed.</p><p>The advantage of powered phlebectomy is the need for fewer incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, systematic reviews have found that TIPP is associated with more postoperative pain and hematoma formation compared with ambulatory phlebectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Another disadvantage of TIPP is the additional cost of the specialized equipment and supplies. Many patients with varicose veins also require management of saphenous reflux, which is often performed with an endovenous procedure.

The saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction is ligated and divided but not excised (ie, stripped), thus minimizing any nerve damage. Additional sites for ligation are identified with duplex ultrasound and clinical examination. A systematic review identified four randomized trials comparing CHIVA with vein stripping (n = 721). In two trials that evaluated varicose vein recurrence (follow-up of 3 to 10 years), the pooled estimate for the risk of recurrence was significantly lower for the CHIVA method compared with vein stripping (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforator ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refluxing perforator veins may be identified as a source for varicose vein clusters, and are typically ligated during the course of phlebectomy.
