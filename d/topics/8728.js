Infection in these patients often results in excessive morbidity and mortality, and antimicrobial therapy is often less effective than in the unimpaired host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many patients with impaired immunity are unable to mount a protective immune response to active vaccination. Furthermore, immunization with live virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated strains.</p><p>The risk of acquiring infection and the inability to prevent infection by immunization are directly related to the patient's &quot;net state of immunosuppression&quot; or severity of disease. The greater the degree of immunosuppression, the less likely the patient is to respond to immunization. Although certain existing vaccines provide some benefit to the immunocompromised patient, a vaccine response cannot be assumed. Successful protection of the immunocompromised adult may require the use of vaccines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> passive immunization (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>) as well as adjunctive measures, such as antiviral drug prophylaxis during influenza A outbreaks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of seasonal influenza with antiviral drugs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-and-treatment-with-antiviral-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention and treatment with antiviral drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for immunizing adults who have undergone chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors or who have other immunocompromising conditions will be reviewed here. Issues related to immunizations in patients who have had hematopoietic cell transplants or solid organ transplants or who are infected with HIV as well as in healthy children and adults are discussed separately.

Patients with hematologic malignancies tend to be more immunocompromised than those with solid tumors. However, patients with solid tumors are also at risk of infection on the basis of debility, malnutrition, and, in some cases, anatomic obstruction (eg, lung masses obstructing bronchial drainage).</p><p>Vaccines are important for patients with cancer, but they should not be given during periods of immunosuppression from chemotherapy immunotherapy because, at such times, they may not be effective and live vaccines may result in vaccine-derived infections. The timing of immunizations in patients with cancer is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H200099564\" class=\"local\">'Timing of immunizations'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment for many cancers has intensified greatly in recent years, resulting in improved patient outcomes, but few studies of immunity and vaccination have been published during this time period. Immunization recommendations for immunocompromised patients in the United States have been developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91881 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also includes recommendations for immunocompromised patients in their guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Our recommendations are generally in keeping with those of the IDSA and the ACIP.</p><p>When both inactivated and live formulations of a given vaccine are available, the inactivated formulation is preferred in patients with cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200099564\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF IMMUNIZATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of administration of immunizations in patients with cancer is summarized as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunizing prior to chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; All indicated vaccines should be given to adult cancer patients before initiation of chemotherapy, before therapy with other immunosuppressive drugs, and before radiation or splenectomy, when feasible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91881 \">table 1</a>).

If inactivated vaccines are given during chemotherapy, they should not be considered valid doses unless protective antibodies are documented. In such patients, vaccines should be readministered after the recovery of immune competence. Revaccination of individuals after chemotherapy or radiation is generally unnecessary if the prior vaccination occurred before chemotherapy, with the exception of hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.

Little is known about response to tetanus and diphtheria immunization in the heterogeneous population of cancer patients, although in one study, children on maintenance chemotherapy had an immune response similar to that observed in healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Tetanus and diphtheria booster immunizations should be considered for all patients with cancer. In addition, adults who have not been vaccinated with the acellular pertussis vaccine should receive the vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap). Td or Tdap should ideally be given before starting treatment and preferably not during cycles of intensive chemotherapy. Pertussis vaccination in children is discussed separately.

Responses to PPSV23 vary but are better (even close to normal) if the vaccine is administered prior to the onset of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].

Vaccine responses are particularly poor after initiating cancer treatment in patients with leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and head and neck cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

At least in Hodgkin lymphoma, priming with the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7; Prevnar 7) appears to improve the response to the subsequent administration of PPSV23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additional evidence supporting the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in high-risk adults comes from a randomized trial of PCV7 in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Although inactivated vaccines are generally avoided in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy (eg, induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukemia), we favor giving an inactivated influenza vaccine to such patients given the need for annual administration to protect against circulating seasonal strains of influenza. Immunization of family members and hospital staff is also strongly recommended. The current recommendations do not support administration of a second dose of the influenza vaccine within the same season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-adults-with-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many patients with impaired immunity are unable to mount a protective immune response to active vaccination. Furthermore, immunization with live virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated strains. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All indicated vaccines should be given to adult cancer patients before initiation of chemotherapy, before therapy with other immunosuppressive drugs, and before radiation or splenectomy, when feasible. Indicated inactivated vaccines should be given &ge;2 weeks prior to chemotherapy, and indicated live virus vaccines should be given &ge;4 weeks prior to chemotherapy.
