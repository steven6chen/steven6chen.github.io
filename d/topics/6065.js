These are opacified by injection of a contrast medium, thereby permitting their radiologic visualization and allowing for a variety of therapeutic interventions. It is a relatively complex endoscopic procedure since it requires specialized equipment and has a long learning curve to develop proficiency. Its benefits in the minimally invasive management of biliary and pancreatic disorders are challenged by a higher potential for serious complications than any other standard endoscopic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The use of ERCP appears to be increasing with time. In a population-based study from Olmstead County in the United States, average utilization of ERCP increased from 58 to 105 ERCPs per 100,000 persons per year over a 10-year period from 1997 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Similar to other endoscopic procedures, determinants of ERCP procedural safety include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indication (appropriate or questionable)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation and monitoring practice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age and clinical condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific procedures performed (diagnostic or therapeutic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting and equipment of the endoscopy unit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Training and competence of endoscopist and endoscopic team</p><p/><p>This topic will review the indications for ERCP and provide an overview of the complications associated with diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP, including their definition, classification, incidence, and risk factors.

Cannulation is only one diagnostic component of an ERCP, but ERCP has evolved from a diagnostic to a predominantly therapeutic procedure and the procedural thresholds have risen well above the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) training guideline published in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and updated in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], according to a systematic review assessing 137 trainees and 17,100 ERCPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Instead, preprocedure testing should be used selectively based on the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and procedural risk factors. Since ERCP carries an approximate 5 percent risk of major complications, including acute pancreatitis, bleeding, sepsis, and perforation, we typically obtain laboratory tests prior to the procedure if an intervention is anticipated (such as sphincterotomy) and blood tests have not been obtained as part of the patient's prior evaluation. Such tests include a complete blood count and prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio.</p><p>We generally agree with 2014 guidelines from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) that recommend preprocedure testing in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential who provide an uncertain pregnancy history or who have a history suggestive of a current pregnancy (particularly if fluoroscopy is going to be used).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation studies for patients with active bleeding, a known or suspected bleeding disorder (including a history of abnormal bleeding), an increased risk of bleeding due to medication use (eg, ongoing anticoagulant use, prolonged antibiotic use), prolonged biliary obstruction, malnutrition, or other conditions associated with acquired coagulopathies.

A number of patient-related and technique-related factors are known to increase the risk of complications. It is not uncommon for malpractice claims or lawsuits related to complications to be decided in favor of the plaintiff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with the procedure during procurement of informed consent. The informed consent process varies according to the ethics of the medical profession and the rules of each country, but it typically requires that the patient has adequate awareness of who the operator will be, the specific benefits and risks of the procedure, and possible alternatives.</p><p>One should also note that malpractice claims or lawsuits related to complications are serious troubles for the operator, administration, and insurance company [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84322500\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DURING AND AFTER ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful clinical monitoring of the patient by the operator and assistants is mandatory since ERCP is a complex procedure that is often performed for therapeutic purposes and requires sedation. Electronic monitoring devices such as pulse oximetry enhance the safety of moderate sedation and are commonly used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient is ordinarily kept fasting before the procedure. Following the procedure, most experienced endoscopists will have patients who are at high or moderate risk of complications continue to fast, or they will advance the diet to clear liquids only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Such patients may resume their normal diet the next morning. Patients who are at low risk of complications can have their diet advanced gradually over four to six hours. A routine measurement of serum pancreatic enzymes prior to the procedure and later for early detection of post-ERCP pancreatitis has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

While ambient air is not absorbed by the bowel, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is rapidly absorbed from the bowel and is delivered to the lungs by the circulation. Therefore, CO<sub>2 </sub>has the potential to reduce post-ERCP pain and discomfort, but this potential advantage may be offset by hypercapnia and cardiopulmonary side effects in older adults. The use of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation during ERCP is controversial, but according to a meta-analysis involving 818 patients in seven randomized controlled trials, CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation during ERCP appeared safe and reduced abdominal pain and discomfort compared with air insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Although considered to be a diagnostic procedure, sphincter of Oddi manometry is associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Sphincterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most data on sphincterotomy early complications were derived from older retrospective series; commonly quoted rates of complications were approximately 10 percent, with an overall mortality of approximately 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Similar complication rates were observed in two prospective studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66631 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/10,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,58</a>]. However, closer inspection of these data reveals that the types of complications have changed over time. In a review of over 3000 patients who underwent ERCP during a 25-year period from 1973 to 1997, the rate of hemorrhage and perforation decreased from 3 to 2 percent and from 1 to 0.2 to 0.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. At the same time, the rate of pancreatitis increased from 2 to approximately 5 percent due to more accurate diagnosis and standardized modalities of data collection. These observations can be interpreted as suggesting that the overall complication rate of sphincterotomy has probably decreased. This interpretation is supported by a reduction in the procedure-related mortality rate from more than 1 to approximately 0.5 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66631 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Late complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term complications following endoscopic sphincterotomy include stone recurrence, papillary stenosis, and cholangitis, which occur in approximately 6 to 24 percent of patients. The long-term risk of subsequent cholangiocarcinoma has not been convincingly proven; however, it may be prudent to avoid endoscopic sphincterotomy in very young patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
