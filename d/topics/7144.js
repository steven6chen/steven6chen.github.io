It happens in babies whose mothers drank alcohol when they were pregnant. Compared with normal babies, babies with FAS tend to weigh less, have smaller heads, and be very fussy. When they grow up, they have life-long problems in how they think and behave.</p><p>Doctors use the term &quot;fetal alcohol spectrum disorder&quot; (FASD) to describe the problems that can happen in people whose mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy. The word &quot;spectrum&quot; means that some people have more serious problems than others. For example, a child might not have all of the symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome, but might still have problems with thinking, learning, or behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26670695\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baby born with FAS has a face that looks different from those of other babies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83246 \">figure 1</a>). He or she has:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thin upper lip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A smooth ridge between the upper lip and nose &ndash; This area is called the &quot;philtrum.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye openings that are shorter than normal</p><p/><p>Babies with FAS also tend to be fussy and are very sensitive to noise.</p><p>In children with FAS, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Developmental delays&quot; &ndash; This means they take longer to do things other children the same age can do, such as walking and talking.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more active than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having weak, floppy muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having problems with learning, hearing, and seeing</p><p/><p>In teenagers and adults with FAS, symptoms might include problems with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinking and memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paying attention and concentrating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting along with other people</p><p/><p>People with FAS are often not able to keep a job or to live on their own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26670710\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for fetal alcohol syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your baby or child has it by learning about his or her symptoms and doing an exam. He or she will also ask questions about how much alcohol you drank during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26670725\"><span class=\"h1\">How is fetal alcohol syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The problems caused by FAS cannot be undone. But a treatment known as &quot;early intervention&quot; can sometimes help. Early intervention programs have different types of experts. They will teach you how to help your child do everyday things he or she might have trouble doing, such as speaking and learning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26670740\"><span class=\"h1\">Can fetal alcohol syndrome be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Women can prevent FAS by not drinking alcohol when they are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. No amount of alcohol has been proven to be safe during pregnancy. So the best way to protect your baby is to avoid it completely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26670755\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
