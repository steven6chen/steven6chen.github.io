During World War I, more than a million soldiers developed trench fever, and military physicians reported on the wide range of clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The military physicians established the War Office Trench Fever Investigation Commission and this group identified the human body louse <em>Pediculus humanus</em> variety <em>corporis</em> as the vector for the infectious pathogen, with transmission occurring via inoculation of infected louse feces into abraded skin or conjunctivae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During World War II, a significant, but less extensive, trench fever epidemic occurred. Subsequently, endemic and sporadic outbreaks of trench fever occurred in the middle part of the century in multiple regions of the world, including Ethiopia (1946), Poland (1949), Mexico (1954), USSR (1960), and Tunisia (1961) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Since the 1990s, sporadic <em>B. quintana</em> infections have reemerged in the United States and Europe, most often manifesting as bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>], or bacillary angiomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections have disproportionately affected indigent or homeless persons who often have chronic alcoholism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. One study from France noted intraerythrocytic organisms in a small proportion of erythrocytes from 9 of 18 homeless individuals with <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia; the authors speculated that infection of erythrocytes could allow body lice to efficiently transmit <em>B. quintana</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although investigators have reported scattered outbreaks of contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections, serologic studies suggest that exposure to the pathogen among certain at-risk populations is more common than overt clinical disease. In studies of indigent or homeless populations in the United States and France, <em>B. quintana</em> antibodies were present in 8 to 53 percent compared with 0 to 2 percent of healthy blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. The frequency of current infection, as determined by blood culture, was assessed in a report of 930 homeless patients and 217 sex-and age-matched controls: <em>B. quintana</em> was isolated in 5.3 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lice generally have been considered to be the major vector for <em>B. quintana</em> in classic trench fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Although three lice species, <em>Pediculus humanus</em> var <em>capitis</em> (head louse), <em>P. humanus</em> var <em>corporis</em> (body louse), and <em>P. humanus</em> var <em>pubis</em> (pubic louse), can potentially transmit <em>B. quintana</em>, available data suggest the body louse is the predominant vector. Since <em>B. quintana </em>propagates in the intestinal lumen of the body louse, not in the intestinal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], infection probably results from contact with contaminated louse feces. One study from 1939 documented the presence of <em>B. quintana</em> in ticks that had fed on humans who had a trench fever-like illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Most experts also believe that lice serve as the source of contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, <em>B. quintana</em> infection occurred among a cluster of homeless, HIV-infected persons, most of whom had head or body lice exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series from Russia, 33 (12.3 percent) of 268 body lice samples from homeless men were positive for <em>B. quintana</em> using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The same investigators found a similar prevalence of <em>B. quintana</em>-infected lice in Burundi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most convincing evidence implicating lice in contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections was the isolation of the organism from lice extracted from three patients with <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia in Marseilles, France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In San Francisco, investigators used PCR techniques to identify <em>B. quintana</em> in lice pools from homeless persons infested with head or body lice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

On day 15, the lice were excreting millions of <em>B. quintana</em> per day.</p><p/><p>Rarely, exposure to cats or their fleas may be associated with the transmission of <em>B. quintana</em>, in contrast to <em>Bartonella henselae</em> infection, which generally results from cat exposures. As examples, during an outbreak of <em>B. quintana</em> in Seattle, three patients reported a recent cat scratch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; in a separate case report, a cat owner developed bacteremia and lymphadenopathy due to <em>B. quintana</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cats are not a natural host for <em>B. quintana</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, <em>B. quintana</em> has been isolated from cat dental pulp and cat fleas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In vitro experimental models have also established that cat fleas can acquire <em>B. quintana</em> through feeding, and then excrete the organisms in their feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One study also found that bed bugs (<em>Cimex</em> <em>lectularius</em>) can acquire <em>B</em>. <em>quintana</em> and release the bacteria in their feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The biologic role for fleas or bed bugs in the transmission of <em>B. quintana</em> to humans remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>Humans are considered the main host for this organism. In both classic and contemporary trench fever, <em>B. quintana</em> occurs in situations that foster very close contact of humans, particularly those with poor hygienic practices. Several reports have also documented isolation of <em>B. quintana</em> in macaques, and prior inoculation studies found chronic <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia could be established in macaques. In addition, in a study involving primate centers in China, <em>B. quintana</em> was detected in blood of more than 10 percent of the macaques, and the genetic diversity of <em>B. quintana</em> in the macaques was much broader than observed in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These findings suggest non-human primates serve as a natural host for <em>B. quintana</em> and that subsets of <em>B. quintana</em> strains in macaques may have spilled over into human populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, <em>B. quintana</em> disease in humans may have a zoonotic origin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with <em>B. quintana</em> can lead to an array of clinical presentations that generally depend upon the immune status of the infected individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic trench fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic trench fever includes a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from a mild influenza-like illness to a moderately severe, chronic, debilitating disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/2,20,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,32</a>]. Most persons who develop these symptoms presumably have bacteremia with <em>B. quintana</em>. Clinical observations from persons infected during World War I suggested an average incubation period of 7.7 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Data from controlled studies in human volunteers inoculated with <em>B. quintana</em>-infected louse feces indicate an incubation range of 5 to 20 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The symptoms and signs of the acute disease typically include malaise, fever, headache, dizziness, bone pain (particularly of the shins), splenomegaly, nausea, vomiting, and, in some instances, a macular truncal rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Investigators have observed four major fever patterns associated with classic trench fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An isolated febrile episode</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single febrile episode lasting four to five days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three to five recurrent febrile episodes, each lasting four to five days and punctuated by asymptomatic intervals also four to five days in duration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent fever lasting two to six weeks</p><p/><p>The term &quot;quintan fever&quot; derives from the recurring five day attacks. Among the four fever patterns, the episodic pattern occurs the most frequently. In some instances, patients may develop persistent bacteremia without fever. The primary clinical episode can be followed by prolonged bacteremia lasting weeks to months. Death, however, rarely occurs in either the acute or chronic illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Contemporary B. quintana infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections were first described in HIV-infected individuals in the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/12,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,33</a>]. In a study of 46 HIV-infected persons, <em>B. quintana</em> predominantly caused bacillary angiomatosis, manifesting as cutaneous lesions, subcutaneous masses, or bone lesions, but not lymph node, liver, or splenic lesions (as commonly seen with <em>B. henselae</em> infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Among the 10 patients involved in the cluster of <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia from a 1993 Seattle outbreak, seven had a temperature greater than 38.5&ordm;C and one had hypothermia (median temperature 38.5&ordm;C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Three had weight loss that exceeded 20 pounds (9.1 kg), and two had splenomegaly. Six of the 10 patients had three or more blood cultures positive for <em>B. quintana</em>, and 4 of 10 had positive blood cultures separated by at least 10 days.</p><p>In the 1997 study in Marseilles, France, <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia occurred in 10 (14 percent) of 71 homeless persons evaluated at an emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most of those patients with <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia had an illness characterized by leg pain, headaches, and thrombocytopenia; only one had the typical shin pain described with classic trench fever. Two of 10 patients had a temperature greater than 38&ordm;C, and several of the patients had chronic bacteremia with few or no symptoms.</p><p>In the Seattle outbreak, 2 of the 10 patients had endocarditis. Similarly, in a report from France, three patients with <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia developed endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a subsequent multicenter international study from France, England, Canada, and South Africa, investigators evaluated patients with blood culture-negative endocarditis and found 22 patients with <em>Bartonella</em> endocarditis, including five with <em>B. quintana</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocarditis-caused-by-bartonella\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endocarditis caused by Bartonella&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections have not generally been associated with lymphadenopathy, there are several case reports of patients with <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia and adenopathy. One 30-year-old woman developed cervical adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and a hemodialysis patient had generalized lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of <em>Bartonella</em> infection is made by isolating the organism from a culture of blood or tissue. However, because <em>Bartonella</em> is so difficult to isolate in culture, the diagnosis is more often based upon a combination of serology or polymerase chain reaction testing. <em>Bartonella</em> serologic testing should not stand alone as a means to diagnose <em>Bartonella</em> infection. Histopathology does not typically play an important role in the diagnosis of <em>B. quintana</em> infections, except in HIV-infected persons who have cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. quintana</em> is a fastidious gram-negative bacterium that requires specific laboratory conditions to enhance the yield of culture. Preferably, blood culture samples should be incubated in pediatric or adult isolator tubes or by using EDTA blood tubes. In some instances, <em>Bartonella</em> species have been isolated from BACTEC bottles.</p><p>It is important to proactively communicate with the microbiology laboratory that <em>Bartonella</em> is a potential diagnosis so that the laboratory can optimize culture techniques and can extend the incubation period for a minimum of 21 days. Isolation of organisms from subcultures is enhanced by plating samples onto either chocolate agar or heart infusion agar supplemented with 5 percent rabbit blood. Optimally, the microbiology lab should use fresh agar plates and incubate them in 5 percent CO<sub>2</sub> at 35 to 37&ordm;C for a minimum of 21 days (incubation periods as long as 45 days have been documented). Identifying <em>B. quintana</em> within erythrocytes has led one group to recommend freezing blood samples prior to plating to release intracellular bacteria and thus enhance the yield of blood culture samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard histologic hematoxylin and eosin staining of bacillary angiomatosis lesions from any site characteristically shows lobular vascular proliferations composed of rounded vessels lined by variably protuberant plump endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Clusters of neutrophils, neutrophilic debris, and lymphocytes are also scattered throughout the lesions, especially around eosinophilic granular aggregates. Warthin-Starry silver staining of these aggregates reveals masses of small, dark-staining bacteria.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the 1990s, sporadic <em>B. quintana</em> infections have reemerged in the United States and Europe and contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections have disproportionately affected indigent or homeless persons who often have chronic alcoholism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although investigators have reported scattered outbreaks of contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections, serologic studies suggest that exposure to the pathogen among certain at-risk populations is more common than overt clinical disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lice generally have been considered to be the major vector for <em>B. quintana</em> in classic trench fever. Available data suggest that the body louse is the predominant vector and infection probably results from contact with contaminated louse feces. Humans are the only known host for this organism. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In both classic and contemporary trench fever, <em>B. quintana</em> occurs in situations that foster very close contact of humans, particularly those with poor hygienic practices. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with <em>B. quintana</em> can lead to an array of clinical presentations that generally depend upon the immune status of the infected individual:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Classic trench fever includes a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from a mild influenza-like illness to a moderately severe, chronic, debilitating disease. Most persons who develop these symptoms presumably have bacteremia with <em>B. quintana</em>. The symptoms and signs of the acute disease typically include malaise, fever, headache, bone pain (particularly of the shins), splenomegaly, and, in some instances, a maculopapular rash. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classic trench fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections were first described in HIV-infected individuals in the early 1990s. In such patients, <em>B. quintana</em> predominantly caused bacillary angiomatosis, manifesting as cutaneous lesions, subcutaneous masses, or bone lesions, but not lymph node, liver, or splenic lesions (as commonly seen with <em>Bartonella henselae</em> infection). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contemporary B. quintana infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The clinical manifestations of contemporary <em>B. quintana</em> infections among immunocompetent persons have differed from those in HIV-infected patients and have more closely resembled classic trench fever. Most patients have had bacteremia, and some have had endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contemporary B. quintana infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of <em>Bartonella</em> infection is made by isolating the organism from a culture of blood or tissue. More frequently the diagnosis is made based upon a combination of findings from serology or polymerase chain reaction. Histopathology does not typically play an important role in the diagnosis of <em>B. quintana</em> infections, except in HIV-infected persons who have cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. <em>B. quintana</em> is a fastidious gram-negative bacterium that requires specific laboratory conditions to enhance the yield of culture. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive antibiotic therapy recommendations for <em>B. quintana</em> infection are problematic because of limited treatment efficacy data, relatively poor correlations of in vitro data and clinical responses, and difficultly judging treatment response in the subset of patients with <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia who have minimal or no clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have acute or chronic <em>B. quintana</em> bacteremia without endocarditis, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 200 mg orally once daily (or 100 mg twice daily) for four weeks plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV once daily for the first 2 weeks.
