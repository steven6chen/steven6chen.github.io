The ascending thoracic aorta gives off the coronary arteries, and the aortic arch branches are typically the brachiocephalic trunk (branches to the right carotid and right subclavian arteries) and left carotid and left subclavian arteries; however, aortic arch anatomy can vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54048\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54048 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The descending thoracic aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86026\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86026 \">figure 1</a>) provides paired thoracic arteries (T1 to T12) and continues through the hiatus of the diaphragm to become the abdominal aorta, which extends retroperitoneally to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal aorta is a retroperitoneal structure that begins at the hiatus of the diaphragm and extends to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 3</a>). It lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava, which is in close apposition. </p><p/><p>Descending thoracic aortic aneurysms are described by the Crawford classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], with its modification by Safi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66037\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66037 \">figure 4</a>), while descending thoracic aortic dissections (type B) are described by the Stanford and DeBakey classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115 \">figure 5</a>). The extent of aortic involvement is the strongest risk factor for paresis and paraplegia. Crawford Extent II aneurysms, which extend from the left subclavian to the aortic bifurcation, have the highest rates of paraplegia related to spinal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Sacrifice of eight or fewer segmental arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86026\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86026 \">figure 1</a>) is well tolerated and has a very low risk of paraplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The spinal cord receives its blood supply from three major sources (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62845 \">figure 6</a>), and although it has physiologic reserves via the spinal cord collateral network, the more arterial feeders that are disrupted and the more distal their location, the greater the chance for clinically significant spinal cord ischemia. The anatomy of the spinal cord is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Preoperative imaging with careful evaluation of feeding lumbar arteries should be performed to determine which segmental arteries can or should be sacrificed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

First-line imaging modalities are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. Our preference is for contrast-gated CT angiography as it provides the best evaluation of the ascending aorta and eliminates motion artifact. Images of the entire aorta should be obtained and be detailed enough to evaluate the extent of disease and plan intervention. We use a 128-slice scanner at our institution, but a lesser number of slices may be adequate to view aortic anatomy. Intravenous contrast should be used to optimally differentiate intraluminal and extraluminal structures. MR angiography is an alternative, though cardiac motion may make evaluation difficult. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67131898\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthesia and patient monitoring techniques should be tailored to individual patient needs to facilitate surgical and perfusion techniques and monitoring of hemodynamics and organ function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is routinely used in all open surgical repairs of the thoracic aorta, unless there are specific contraindications to its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H841973\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid drainage and perioperative monitoring of spinal pressure (mean arterial pressure - spinal pressure of greater than 80 mmHg) and spinal cord function are recommended for patients at high risk for spinal cord ischemia (ie, extent I and II disease). Intraoperative techniques that maintain proximal aortic pressure and perfuse the distal aorta reduce the incidence of spinal cord injury following open thoracic aortic repair. In our protocol, we maintain intrathecal pressure &le;10 mmHg. Intraoperative motor or somatosensory evoked potential monitoring can also be used to detect early spinal cord ischemia, which may help guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. It is reasonable to base the decision to use neurophysiologic monitoring on individual patient needs, institutional resources, the urgency of the procedure, and the surgical and perfusion techniques to be used during open thoracic aortic repair. Intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papaverine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">papaverine</a> also enhances spinal cord perfusion and provides additional protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Moderate systemic hypothermia is also reasonable. Other adjunctive techniques, including epidural irrigation with hypothermic solutions, high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, osmotic diuresis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, intrathecal papaverine, and cellular metabolic suppression with anesthetic agents, may also improve the tolerance of the spinal cord to reduced perfusion, when it occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Preoperative hydration and intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> administration may be reasonable strategies to preserve renal function. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Furosemide</a>, mannitol, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> should not be given solely for the purpose of renal protection in descending aortic repairs.

During thoracoabdominal or descending aortic repairs that provide surgical exposure of the renal arteries, renal protection using either cold crystalloid or blood perfusion are options. </p><p>The complexity of open thoracic aortic surgery dictates long operative times with large volume blood loss; intractable hemorrhage is a dreaded complication. An algorithmic approach to transfusion, antifibrinolytic, and anticoagulation management is reasonable to use in open thoracic aortic repairs. Institutional variations in coagulation testing capability and availability of transfusion products and other prothrombotic and antithrombotic agents are important considerations in defining such an approach. Massive transfusion protocols are usually in place for these procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but if after all product has been replaced the patient continues to be coagulopathic and hemorrhage, other anticoagulants like recombinant Factor VII, factor eight inhibitor bypass activity (FEIBA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> (TXA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] have been used with good results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H841973\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical approach to repair of the thoracic aorta depends on the location and extent of diseased aorta.

PTFE grafts are occasionally used in infrarenal aortic repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1317991229\"><span class=\"h2\">Hybrid open/endovascular options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the introduction of the endovascular aortic stent graft to treat abdominal aortic pathology, technological improvements have extended their use to the treatment of thoracic aortic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. Type B aortic dissection and descending thoracic aneurysms are largely managed using this approach. For the ascending aorta and arch, significant progress has been made using a combination of open and endovascular techniques (ie, hybrid repair) to accomplish repair of predominantly aneurysmal disease. Hybrid aortic repair is performed in stages. The goal of the first stage is to bypass critical vessels supplying the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> viscera that will later be covered by the stent-graft, using an open approach. This is referred to as a &quot;debranching&quot; procedure. In the second stage, the stent-graft is deployed in the diseased aorta to exclude the aneurysm. Although originally described as two separate procedures, with the advent of hybrid operating rooms, hybrid repair can be performed in a single operative setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107671\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107671 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/43,47-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47-55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183094929\"><span class=\"h2\">Ascending aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repair of the ascending aorta, whether for acute type A dissection, aneurysm, or intramural hemorrhage, is approached in a similar manner, with cardiopulmonary bypass including cardioplegia, and often requires aortic root replacement. </p><p>Hypothermic circulatory arrest involves the use of cardiopulmonary bypass with the establishment of profound systemic hypothermia (18 to 20&deg;C), followed by controlled exsanguination and total body circulatory standstill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Hypothermic circulatory arrest provides the best operative field visualization; however, the duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is an independent predictor of transient and permanent neurologic injury. Stroke rates increase significantly after 45 minutes of arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/15,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,59,60</a>]. Perioperative brain hyperthermia is not recommended in repairs of the ascending aortic and transverse aortic arch as it is probably injurious to the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>With the patient positioned supine, operative exposure is obtained via median sternotomy. The ascending aorta is exposed and cardiopulmonary bypass is established. Arterial cannulation for ascending aortic pathology has traditionally been performed via the femoral or axillary artery; however, with femoral cannulation in patients with aortic dissection, the false lumen of a dissected aorta can be inadvertently cannulated, and fenestrations in the descending aorta can prevent central perfusion. With axillary and innominate artery placement, an additional time-consuming anastomosis in a difficult location is required to cannulate. A 2014 meta-analysis of 14 trials that included 4476 patients undergoing aortic surgery compared central aortic cannulation sites (including the axillary artery) with a femoral arterial site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The risk of permanent neurologic deficit was significantly lower for central cannulation (risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.90), as was mortality (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.70). The advantages seen for central cannulation in this study were attributed to decreased risk of retrograde cerebral embolization or iatrogenic aortic dissection caused by reversed blood flow in the descending thoracic aorta, and to facilitation of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) techniques. Thus, for these reasons, whenever possible, we use a central arterial cannulation directly into the true lumen of the ascending aorta via the Seldinger technique with an 18-Fr cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. It is important to note, for this technique, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) must be used to confirm wire placement in the true lumen. For venous cannulation, we use dual-stage inferior vena cava cannulation via a right atriotomy, and superior vena cava cannulation via a right-angled 24-Fr cannula. An 18-Fr left ventricular vent is placed in the superior pulmonary vein to decompress the heart. A retrograde 14-Fr cannula is placed via a right atriotomy into the coronary sinus and confirmed by TEE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107672 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107785 \">figure 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107786 \">figure 10</a>). </p><p>Bypass is initiated and the patient is cooled. The aorta is cross-clamped proximal to the cannulation site, and retrograde cardioplegia is administered while the aorta is opened. The aneurysmal or proximal extent of the dissected aorta is resected. Once the root is exposed, antegrade cardioplegia is given directly into the coronary arteries. The aortic root and aortic valve are carefully inspected. If there is extensive dissection of the aortic root, aortic root dilatation, or aortic insufficiency, then aortic root replacement with a composite graft, or a valve-sparing aortic root replacement should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1869418226\" class=\"local\">'Involvement of the aortic root'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the patient has profound hypothermia (18 to 20&deg;C) and the electroencephalogram is silent, the patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position and hypothermic circulatory arrest is begun. Speed is of the utmost importance at this time, as length of circulatory arrest is directly related to cerebral morbidity and mortality. Antegrade cardiopulmonary bypass is terminated, the cross-clamp is removed, and retrograde cardiopulmonary bypass is begun via the superior vena cava cannula. For patients with aortic dissection, the distal ascending aorta is resected until the primary tear is excised; it is critical that the site of primary tear is resected. When managing ascending aortic dissection, the proximal extent of dissection should be obliterated with felt and fibrin glue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107675 \">figure 11</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H2537915327\" class=\"local\">'Aortic arch'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the aortic pathology is excised, the distal graft anastomosis is fashioned. For patients with underlying genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or a bicuspid aortic valve, replacement of the aorta from the aortic sinuses to arch vessels should be strongly considered during the initial repair, as they are at high risk for progressive disease when using a composite valve graft (modified Bentall procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], or valve-sparing aortic root replacement.

Cerebral protection can be accomplished using retrograde cerebral perfusion or selective antegrade perfusion. Excellent results can be achieved with either technique. Currently, there are no good direct comparisons in comparable patient populations to establish superiority of one technique over the other, although there are numerous publications favoring one strategy over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A systematic review identified 15 studies comparing selective antegrade cerebral perfusion with retrograde cerebral perfusion in 5060 patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with temperatures ranging from 16 to 26&deg;C for aortic arch surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. A pooled analysis showed no significant difference in perioperative (30-day) mortality, permanent neurologic dysfunction, or transient neurologic dysfunction between the groups. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrograde cerebral perfusion involves perfusing the jugular vein with cold oxygenated blood in a retrograde manner in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>]. Deoxygenated blood containing cellular metabolic byproducts returns via the carotid orifices. The mechanism of retrograde cerebral perfusion is controversial; it is purported to provide neuronal metabolic support, preserve cerebral autoregulation, and enhance cerebral cooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/81-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-87</a>]. The risk of stroke is significantly reduced with retrograde cerebral perfusion compared with hypothermic circulatory arrest alone. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, blood flow is established antegrade via grafts that are anastomosed to the brachiocephalic and left carotid arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Advantages of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion include the ability to control flow, perfusion pressure, and perfusate temperature to the brain. Although selective antegrade cerebral perfusion is metabolically optimal, it can be technically cumbersome and risks cerebral embolism and carotid dissection. A variation of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion using a trifurcated graft (ie, grafts to the brachiocephalic, left carotid, and right carotid arteries) has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. The trifurcated graft approach may reduce embolic complications. </p><p/><p>In our preferred technique, once hypothermic circulatory arrest has been established, retrograde cerebral perfusion is begun and the pathology is excised, often involving the origin of one or more of the arch vessels (innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries). Any diseased vascular segments are excised and replaced with a graft. Balloon occlusion catheters are placed into the exposed arch vessels for antegrade cerebral perfusion. Once antegrade perfusion to the brain is established, retrograde perfusion is terminated. </p><p>Aortic reconstruction is performed with a Dacron tube graft starting with the distal anastomosis, which is accomplished by everting the graft to create a reverse elephant trunk. Once the distal anastomosis is completed, the graft is cannulated and clamped proximally, thus reestablishing body perfusion. The patient is then slowly rewarmed. Next, depending upon the extent of arch involvement, a total arch or hemiarch repair can be performed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total arch repair &ndash; Replacement of the entire aortic arch is indicated for aneurysms of the entire arch, acute dissections where the arch is aneurysmal, or if there is extensive destruction and leakage, chronic dissection when the arch is enlarged, and for distal arch aneurysms that also involve the proximal descending thoracic aorta, usually with the elephant trunk procedure. The entire arch is excised, and the arch vessels are individually re-anastomosed to the replaced arch. An 8-mm Dacron graft is often used for the left carotid artery while a 10-mm Dacron graft is often used for the innominate artery. After the anastomosis is completed, each of these grafts is cannulated and selective antegrade perfusion is given (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107784 \">figure 15</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The elephant trunk technique is often used in total arch replacement. The elephant trunk technique leaves a graft inside the distal aorta (trunk) which can then be used for a proximal anastomosis in future operations. It was originally described as a two-stage operation but can be performed in one stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/92-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-96</a>]. With a frozen elephant trunk procedure, the arch is replaced in the manner of a traditional elephant trunk, but instead of performing a second open operation to replace the descending aorta, a thoracic aortic stent-graft is placed either at the initial operation or at a later date. This allows for a one-stage repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>].

The patch is anastomosed to a Dacron tube graft that spans the entire arch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107679 \">figure 16</a>). </p><p/><p>Once the arch vessel-to-graft anastomoses have been performed and the antegrade cannulas are in place perfusing the brain, attention is turned to restoring proximal aortic continuity. The aortic root graft, if needed, or native aorta is anastomosed to the aortic arch graft in a beveled end-to-end fashion while the system is de-aired. Once this anastomosis is complete, the cross clamp is removed and the heart is re-perfused. Atrial and ventricular wires are placed. Starting with the left carotid graft, then followed with the innominate graft, each of the Dacron grafts, or the vessel patch, is anastomosed to the arch graft in a running fashion. Because there is ischemic time to the brain during the anastomoses, cerebral oximetry is maintained throughout the entire operation and closely monitored during this segment. Again, speed is critical during this portion of the operation as ischemic time is directly related to cerebral morbidity and mortality. Once the anastomoses are completed, the grafts and heart are de-aired, and the patient is optimized, then weaned from bypass.

Those procedures that replace the aorta from the distal left subclavian artery to below the renal arteries, Crawford extent II, are associated with the highest risk for spinal cord ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/92,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,100,101</a>]. </p><p>Although early studies reported that a quick operation (clamp and sew) without adjunctive measures was sufficient for thoracic aortic repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/102-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-107</a>], later studies suggested that end-organ protection measures, such as cerebrospinal fluid drainage combined with intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papaverine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">papaverine</a> in high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/26,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,108</a>]; intercostal re-implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]; distal aortic perfusion using bypass circuitry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/26,110-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,110-114</a>]; selective perfusion of renal, segmental, and visceral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/24,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,115</a>]; and profound hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,117</a>], can markedly decrease the likelihood of spinal, mesenteric, and renal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>]. Patients who benefit most from these protective strategies are higher risk patients, including those with renal dysfunction, peripheral artery disease (PAD), long aortic segment surgery, and prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. </p><p>Exposure for repair of the descending thoracic aorta is obtained with a left-sided posterolateral thoracotomy with the patient in the right semi-lateral decubitus position (shoulders positioned posteriorly 10 to 20&deg;; pelvis is rotated 50 to 60&deg; posteriorly), and the table is flexed at the patient's waist. For access to the distal arch and descending aorta, the incision is made at the sixth intercostal space.

For thoracoabdominal aneurysms, the left thoracotomy incision is extended across the costal margin to continue midline for a retroperitoneal approach.</p><p>Many strategies for cardiopulmonary bypass are described for managing descending aortic dissection and aneurysms. Our preferred method is partial left heart bypass with venous drainage from the left femoral vein, and an elongated venous cannula advanced to the level of the right atrium.

Atrial cannulation in conjunction with femoral artery or descending aorta cannulation has been described, as has femoral-femoral bypass. </p><p>Once cardiopulmonary bypass has been established, the proximal aneurysm is carefully exposed, avoiding injury to the nearby phrenic, vagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves.

Aortotomy is performed and patent intercostal arteries are oversewn. Re-implantation of patent lower intercostal arteries (T8 through T12) is encouraged as sacrifice of these arteries is more frequently associated with neurologic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>]. Somatosensory or motor-evoked potentials detect spinal cord ischemia and are used by some surgeons to guide re-implantation of intercostal arteries. The risk of paraplegia is significantly increased when eight or more segmental arteries are sacrificed during repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one retrospective study of 132 patients, re-implantation of the vessels between T8 intercostal and L2 lumbar arteries significantly reduced operative mortality (4.9 versus 13.2 percent for no re-implantation), the incidence of postoperative paraplegia (0 versus 8.8 percent), and the overall rate of spinal cord dysfunction (2.4 versus 9.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. The diseased aorta is excised from all surrounding tissue including the esophagus. An interposition Dacron tube graft is sewn in a running fashion to the distal and proximal aorta while de-airing. The proximal aortic cross clamp is kept in place for the entire aortic repair procedure to avoid retrograde embolism to the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107680\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107680 \">figure 17</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107787 \">figure 18</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107788\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107788 \">figure 19</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107791\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107791 \">figure 20</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107792\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107792 \">figure 21</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require replacement of the entire aorta (eg, thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms), the proximal anastomosis is performed at the required level. The distal cross clamp is positioned 2 to 3 cm below the site of the proposed distal anastomosis. The aorta is opened posterior to the origin of the left renal artery, and selective perfusion of the viscera is performed with oxygenated cold blood or cold crystalloid solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Next, island patches of large segmental arteries, visceral vessels (celiac, superior mesenteric, right renal), and the left renal artery are created and anastomosed to the Dacron tube graft depending on the extent of affected aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107688 \">figure 22</a>). For patients who have genetically mediated syndromes (eg, Marfan, Loeys-Dietz), island patches should not be performed as there is a risk of future aneurysmal dilatation of the patch. Instead, each of the distal vessels should be individually anastomosed to a Dacron interposition graft. With the completion of each of the anastomoses, the cross clamp can be sequentially replaced more distally to reestablish flow to the aortic branch vessels. Once the island patches are completed, the distal aortic anastomosis is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107681\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107681 \">figure 23</a>). </p><p/><p>For patients with severe aneurysmal disease of the arch, aortic rupture, or calcification necessitating circulatory arrest, the patient is cooled to permissive hypothermia (32&deg;C) and circulatory arrest is established to complete the proximal anastomosis. After de-airing the arch, antegrade flow to the brain is re-established prior to performing the distal anastomosis.

Aortic arch and Crawford type II (proximal descending to infrarenal aorta) aneurysms have the highest morbidity and mortality rates. Morbidity is due to cardiovascular and pulmonary events, spinal cord dysfunction, and renal dysfunction that can require renal replacement therapy. Factors associated with an adverse 30-day outcome (death, paraplegia, paraparesis, stroke, or acute renal failure) after open surgery for thoracoabdominal aneurysm include preoperative renal insufficiency, advanced age, symptomatic aneurysm, and Crawford type II aneurysm (proximal descending to infrarenal aorta).
