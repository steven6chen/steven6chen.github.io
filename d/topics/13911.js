The term &quot;post-thrombotic&quot; replaces the prior terminology &quot;postphlebitic&quot; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A combination of reflux due to valvular incompetence and venous hypertension due to thrombotic obstruction is thought to contribute to post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Symptoms and signs of chronic venous insufficiency may include pain, vein dilation, edema, skin pigmentation, and venous ulcers. Our approach to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome is in broad agreement with published guidelines from the American Heart Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Prevention of DVT through prophylaxis, timely recognition and treatment of DVT, and prevention of recurrent DVT will continue to have the greatest impact on reducing the overall burden of post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The treatment of lower extremity DVT is discussed separately.

A combination of reflux due to valvular incompetence and venous hypertension due to thrombotic obstruction is thought to contribute to post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. One study identified a high peak reflux velocity in the deep proximal veins as an independent predictor of post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Increased venous pressures are transmitted to the capillary beds, promoting transudation of fluid and large molecules, resulting in tissue edema, subcutaneous fibrosis, and, finally, tissue hypoxia and ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) causes obstruction of venous outflow, which can be partial or complete. Vein wall remodeling as a consequence of venous thrombosis, as identified in ultrasound studies, appears to be directly related to the thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines or adhesion molecules, such as interleukin-6 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, have also been linked with the development of post-thrombotic syndrome, suggesting that inflammation may play a role in the pathophysiology of post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The inflammatory response to acute thrombosis and the process of recanalization directly damages venous valves. </p><p>Reflux occurs early, progressively increasing from 17 percent of patients at one week to 69 percent of patients at one year following the diagnosis of DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The degree of initial vein occlusion correlates with the likelihood of developing reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Reflux in the more proximal lower extremity veins may be particularly important to the development of post-thrombotic syndrome. However, popliteal valve incompetence has also been found to increase the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome, particularly when combined with residual vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Recanalization is a complex process involving intrinsic events within the thrombus and is related to an increase in endogenous fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. An inverse relationship between levels of fibrinolytic inhibitors and the degree of recanalization has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Over time, the amount of thrombus decreases, and in some cases, the lumen reestablishes itself (ie, recanalization). More rapid resolution of thrombus may preserve valvular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Recanalization can be seen as early as six weeks from diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], but approximately one-half of legs have residual thrombus causing partial obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The rate of recanalization appears to be related to the initial thrombus load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and thrombus site with distal thrombi undergoing more rapid and complete resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome varies widely, in part due to inhomogeneous patient populations and diagnostic criteria. Older studies reported rates up to 100 percent; contemporary studies cite incidences ranging from 20 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/7,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28,29</a>]. Among studies that use validated diagnostic criteria, the incidence is approximately 50 percent in the first year in spite of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Severe post-thrombotic syndrome occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Most patients who develop post-thrombotic syndrome become symptomatic within two years from the acute episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31</a>]. However, the incidence of severe post-thrombotic syndrome progressively accumulates. In a study of 93 patients who were followed for six years, the incidence of the post-thrombotic syndrome was 49 percent after one year and 55 percent after two years, without further increase up to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a larger prospective study, the cumulative incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome at one, two, and five years was 17, 23, and 28 percent, respectively; these percentages did not increase thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The incidence of severe skin changes indicative of chronic venous insufficiency, including venous ulcer, increased from 2.6 percent at one year to 9.3 percent at five years. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies identify various factors regarding the risk of developing the post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>]. In general, factors that are thought to be important to the development of post-thrombotic syndrome can be broadly characterized as patient specific, related to the inciting deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or related to the treatment of DVT, and are discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Ongoing research seeks to identify biological markers that may predict the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome in individual patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436298064\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-specific</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-specific factors that may increase the risk for post-thrombotic syndrome include preexisting primary venous insufficiency, older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/33,34,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,42</a>], and varicose veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/33,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,43</a>]. There does not appear to be a consistent relationship between gender and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/33-35,39-41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35,39-41,44</a>]. </p><p>Thrombophilia does not appear to increase the risk for developing post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/30,32-34,40,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32-34,40,45</a>]. In one retrospective review of 677 patients, no significant differences in the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome were seen between those patients with thrombophilia (antithrombin, protein C and S deficiencies, lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden) compared with those without thrombophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, this is controversial as there are data in favor of an association as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Related to DVT characteristics</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary versus recurrent DVT &ndash; The development of recurrent ipsilateral DVT is strongly associated with the risk for post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/32,34,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,46,47</a>]. The risk for post-thrombotic syndrome is increased up to sixfold, likely due to worsened venous outflow obstruction and damage to already compromised valves. Other poor prognostic factors include the combination of reflux and obstruction and multisegmental venous involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This suggests that prevention of recurrent thrombosis is the most important intervention to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome in patients presenting with DVT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic versus asymptomatic DVT &ndash; The incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome is probably much lower after asymptomatic DVT, such as those detected on postoperative screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A systematic review concluded that asymptomatic postoperative DVT still substantially increases the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome; however, there was evidence of significant publication bias in the review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal versus distal DVT &ndash; Several studies have found a greater absolute risk of trophic skin changes following venous thrombosis for proximal compared with distal thrombosis, and with deep or combined deep and superficial thrombosis compared with only superficial thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/34,35,51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,51-56</a>]. However, other studies have not demonstrated a greater risk for proximal over distal thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/32,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,57</a>]. It is important to note that &quot;proximal&quot; DVT has included both iliofemoral and femoropopliteal thrombosis. In a study of 387 patients followed over three years, patients with more extensive proximal (femoral or iliac vein) DVT had significantly worse post-thrombotic syndrome scores at all visits (adjusted average increase of &gt;2 points on the Villalta scale) than those with distal or popliteal DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Similarly, proximal DVT increased the risk for post-thrombotic syndrome twofold compared with distal DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome after distal DVT appear to be milder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual thrombus &ndash; Residual thrombus within the first six months after the thrombotic episode appears to be an important risk factor for post-thrombotic syndrome. In a study of 180 patients who were followed for at least three years after an episode of acute proximal DVT, post-thrombotic syndrome developed in 24 percent without vein abnormalities, but in 47 percent with at least one abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome in these patients was as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Residual vein thrombosis: 48 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Popliteal vein valve incompetence: 27 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Residual vein thrombosis and popliteal vein incompetence: 54 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436298591\"><span class=\"h3\">Related to DVT treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimizing the development of post-thrombotic syndrome is related to timely and adequate pharmacologic treatment of DVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate antithrombotic treatment &ndash; The risk of post-thrombotic syndrome is greater in patients who do not maintain adequate anticoagulation during initial treatment for their DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/36,40,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40,59</a>]. In one study comparing patients whose international normalized ratio (INR) was subtherapeutic (&lt;2.0) with those whose INR was &ge;2.0 for more than 50 percent of readings in the first three months of treatment, the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome was significantly increased over five-year follow-up (odds ratio 2.71, 95 percent CI 1.44-5.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In a later study, the overall frequency of post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with subtherapeutic anticoagulation was 33.5 percent, compared with 21.6 percent in those with an INR below 2.0 for &le;20 percent of the treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Due to their rapid onset, ease of administration, and more predictable pharmacokinetics, the new oral anticoagulants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>, could be associated with more effective anticoagulation and a reduced incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Support for this hypothesis comes from experimental evidence and suggests that direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors hasten clot lysis compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>; however, confirmation from clinical trials is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The risk of developing venous ulceration may be lower in patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin compared with oral anticoagulation, which could be due to more consistent anticoagulation. A pooled analysis of two trials found a lower risk of self-reported skin ulcers in patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (risk ratio 0.13, 95 percent CI 0.02-0.71) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Vein recanalization rates following DVT were also higher in patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Antiplatelet therapy may decrease DVT recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Antithrombotic therapy for the treatment of DVT is discussed elsewhere.

The use of thrombolytic therapy to treat acute proximal DVT is theorized to decrease the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome by reducing clot burden or possibly preventing proximal vein valve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/21,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,65</a>]. However, a trial that randomly assigned 692 patients with acute proximal DVT to anticoagulation alone or anticoagulation plus pharmacomechanical thrombolysis found no differences in the overall incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome or for quality of life &#160; Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in fewer patients in the thrombolysis group versus the control group (18 versus 24 percent; risk ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.54-0.98). However, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis led to more major bleeding events within 10 days compared with anticoagulation alone (1.7 versus 0.3 percent).

In patients with a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) <strong>and </strong>obvious <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> of chronic venous insufficiency, a clinical diagnosis of post-thrombotic syndrome can be made; additional diagnostic testing is generally not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because the symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome can be variable over time and can be similar to those of an acute DVT, expert consensus is to wait up to six months following an acute DVT before making a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Venous imaging, typically duplex ultrasound, may be useful for patients in whom the clinical signs of chronic venous insufficiency are not obvious, those with a clinical history that suggests DVT but for whom studies were not performed, and in those with severe symptoms.</p><p>For those without an objectively proven prior DVT, duplex ultrasound can often diagnose or exclude a prior DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/7,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,70</a>].

In the absence of symptoms, venous abnormalities alone, such as venous reflux, persistent venous obstruction, or both as shown by invasive or noninvasive diagnostic studies do not allow a patient with a history of DVT to be defined as having post-thrombotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Commonly used forms of compression include compression stockings, short stretch bandages, zinc paste bandages (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-gelatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Unna boot</a>), and multilayer compression. The choice depends upon the severity of symptoms and presence of edema, skin changes, or ulceration.
