The predominant mineral type in BCP-associated musculoskeletal pathology is carbonated hydroxyapatite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;basic calcium phosphate&quot; refers to a trio of submicron-sized calcium phosphate crystals. These include partially carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate (whitlockite). The terms &quot;calcium phosphate&quot; and &quot;hydroxyapatite&quot; are often used synonymously with the more accurate term &quot;basic calcium phosphate.&quot; BCP crystals are similar in composition to the normal mineral found in bones and teeth as well as to the pathologic mineral found in atherosclerotic plaques and calcinosis cutis.</p><p>An overview of the pathogenesis of BCP-associated musculoskeletal syndromes and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of BCP-associated calcific periarthritis, also termed calcific tendinitis or tendinopathy, will be discussed here. Calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder and BCP-associated arthritis are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcific-tendinopathy-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-arthritis-including-milwaukee-shoulder-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystal arthritis, including Milwaukee shoulder syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2203895355\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF BCP-ASSOCIATED MUSCULOSKELETAL SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of pathologic basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystal formation is not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. BCP mineral formation often occurs at sites of local tissue damage associated with injury or inflammation. Once formed, BCP crystals can produce symptoms and mediate tissue damage by several mechanisms, including the induction of a vigorous inflammatory response, biomechanical disruption, and through direct interactions with nearby cells, resulting in tissue damage in the absence of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Relatively little is known about the factors that specifically initiate symptomatic arthritis or periarthritis associated with BCP crystals.</p><p>There are several contributors to BCP crystal formation, which together with locally high levels of extracellular calcium and phosphate tip the balance of pro- and antimineralization factors to allow BCP crystals to form. These include chondro- or osteometaplasia, which may serve as an inciting factor in BCP mineral formation at sites of local tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cytokines and growth factors found at sites of tissue damage also contribute to BCP crystal formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and alterations in extracellular matrix proteins may permit pathologic mineral formation as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Once formed, BCP crystals can produce symptoms and mediate tissue injury in several ways. Under certain circumstances, BCP crystals induce a vigorous inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mechanism linking BCP crystals to inflammation may involve innate immune pathways, which are shared by other particulates, including monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals. Candidate factors that modulate the inflammatory potential of crystals include crystal size, the type and amount of protein coating the crystals, and the presence of nearby tissue trauma.</p><p>Little is known about the factors that initiate symptomatic arthritis or periarthritis associated with BCP crystals. One theory is that BCP tissue deposits are asymptomatic until something triggers their dissolution, following which osteoclast-mediated resorption introduces pain-producing factors into the surrounding tissues. BCP crystal deposition also disrupts normal tissue biomechanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], which may have important negative consequences in musculoskeletal tissues. Lastly, BCP crystals can directly interact with resident connective tissue cells, even in the absence of an inflammatory response, to produce destructive cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes. As an example, BCP crystals directly induce synovial fibroblasts to increase mitogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and secrete tissue-damaging factors such as collagenase and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. BCP crystals have also been shown to promote osteoclastogenesis, resulting in local bone destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304580297\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma, metabolic, and genetic factors may each be associated with increased risk of basic calcium phosphate (BCP)-associated calcific periarthritis. (See <a href=\"#H745695906\" class=\"local\">'Exogenous or acquired risk factors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H526845924\" class=\"local\">'Genetic risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H745695906\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous or acquired risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with calcific periarthritis are in good general health, although a history of recent trauma or overuse as an antecedent to symptomatic periarthritis is reported by some patients, while absent in many others.</p><p>The metabolic abnormalities associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have been implicated in causing symptomatic periarthritis, but this association is not well documented by population-based studies. This issue is complicated by metabolic abnormalities, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism, that produce systemic elevations of calcium and phosphate and cause widespread BCP mineral deposition known as calciphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], altered estrogen states, and thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] have also been suspected as risk factors for calcific periarthritis, but sufficient evidence is lacking to establish clear associations with these conditions. Most patients have no known risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526845924\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of genetic disorders, including some affecting phosphate metabolism, have been associated with calcific periarthritis. As examples, some adult patients with familial recurrent calcific periarthritis have subtle forms of hypophosphatasia, a congenital deficiency of alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders#H1150487615\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Specific disorders&quot;, section on 'Hypophosphatasia'</a>). In addition, several kindreds with an Augustine-null blood type related to mutations in the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) have affected family members with symptomatic calcific periarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Dramatic familial presentations with large periarticular calcified masses are usually associated with congenital causes of hyperphosphatemia. These patients typically present in childhood and have mutations of <em>GLANT3</em> or the genes encoding fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) or alpha-Klotho. Calcific periarthritis may be the first manifestation of these syndromes in patients with milder phenotypes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes and treatment of hyperphosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other forms of familial calcific periarthritis have been described in association with mutations that produce spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These cases are distinguished from other syndromes by the presence of short stature.

Patients sometimes report fever and chills. Most patients with calcific periarthritis are healthy and middle-aged. Case collections demonstrate two- to threefold more women than men are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A broad age range is typically noted, and calcific periarthritis can also occur in children. The prevalence of radiographic calcific tendinitis in the shoulder is 2.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The prevalence around other joints is not known.</p><p>The affected joints are focally tender with a variable degree of warmth and swelling. Erythema may be present. Joint effusions are typically absent, and the area of tenderness may not correlate with the typical location of the joint line.</p><p>Attacks are self-limited, lasting a few weeks to several months. There are case reports of more chronic symptoms, but it remains unclear whether persistent radiographically evident calcifications contribute to such persistent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>More common syndromes include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large joint involvement</strong> &ndash; Shoulder involvement is the most commonly recognized and best-studied form of calcific periarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Typically, patients report a gradual onset of shoulder pain without trauma. Pain is localized on the top or lateral aspect of the shoulder or both, often with radiation towards the insertion of the deltoid. Most patients report increased pain at night and an inability to lie on the affected shoulder, while during the day, use of the arm above shoulder height causes pain. This condition is described in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcific-tendinopathy-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder&quot;</a>). Elbow involvement is uncommon and typically involves the distal biceps tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Calcific periarthritis around the hip has been well described, but its prevalence is not known. It most frequently involves the rectus femoris, the gluteus maximus, or the gluteus minimus tendon, usually near the femoral insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Symptoms from rectus femoris involvement include pain and tenderness near the anterior-inferior iliac spine and are exacerbated by hip flexion. Snapping hip syndrome has been associated with calcific deposits in the rectus femoris. Involvement of the gluteus maximus produces pain in the proximal thigh, while gluteus minimus involvement causes pain in the low back, buttock, or posterolateral thigh. Iliopsoas involvement is less common and can produce pain in the hip or knee. Knee involvement is uncommon and, when it does occur, can affect any of the ligaments, bursae, and tendons around the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small joint involvement</strong> &ndash; Calcific periarthritis may develop around the small joints of the hands and feet. Hand involvement often occurs at the flexor carpi ulnaris but may affect any of the hand tendons. Involvement of the wrist or base of the thumb may cause acute onset of symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and trigger finger has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Foot involvement is most frequently reported at the first metatarsal phalangeal joint, where it typically presents with symptoms at the plantar aspect of that joint. This syndrome has been referred to as &quot;hydroxyapatite pseudopodagra&quot; and may be particularly common in young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Calcific periarthritis of the foot less commonly involves the peroneus longus tendon or the navicular insertion of the tibialis posterior tendon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other sites of involvement</strong> &ndash; Retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis involves the longus colli high in the cervical spine and can present with acute onset of neck pain and stiffness associated with dysphagia and odynophagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3694477799\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute phase responses (as indicated by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP] levels) are elevated in some symptomatic patients. Other laboratory studies, including complete blood count (CBC), basic chemistries, and levels of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase are typically normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1237286225\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain film radiography</strong> &ndash; Radiographs show amorphous-appearing extraarticular calcifications. These are often in or near tendons or bursae. Calcifications may be present in tendons, bursae, ligaments, or soft tissues, and bone erosions may occur adjacent to the calcific density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Periarticular calcific densities are often described as amorphous or &quot;cloud-like&quot; when they are acute, while chronic calcifications may be denser and more homogeneous. Grading systems have been developed that are based upon the radiographic density of the calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the size and grade of calcification correlates poorly with clinical manifestations or outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> &ndash; Ultrasonography is helpful in expert hands and has been well studied in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In the resting phase, calcifications usually appear as hyperechoic lesions with acoustic shadowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99316\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99316 \">image 1</a>). In the resorptive phase the deposit may appear more fluffy, fragmented, or punctuated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F115478\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115478 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcific-tendinopathy-of-the-shoulder#H2759159907\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> &ndash; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot readily distinguish calcified material from other types of tissue damage. T2 and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images on MRI often demonstrate edema in the area around the calcific deposit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography</strong> &ndash; Computed tomographic (CT) scanning, by contrast with MRI, readily identifies calcifications, and CT scans can be used to confirm the anatomic location of the calcific deposit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; Bone scanning with technetium-99m and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning show concentrated tracer at sites of inflammation around basic calcium phosphate (BCP) deposits that may mimic the appearance of malignant lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3464748618\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few histopathologic studies of calcific periarthritis. In one study, a predominantly histiocytic infiltrate was demonstrated on most pathologic samples from patients with calcific periarthritis, but some tissue samples had neutrophilic infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most calcifications appear as granular and psammoma-like, while larger amorphous calcifications were less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Careful handling of specimens is necessary in order to prevent dissolution of calcium phosphate by methods commonly used for tissue staining and preservation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4059651559\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066530171\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>All patients</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of calcific periarthritis is based upon the presence of a characteristic clinical presentation and typical findings on plain radiographs; the most typical presentation is of an acute onset of pain and swelling around a single joint in a healthy young or middle-aged woman (see <a href=\"#H466935921\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). On physical examination, there is no obvious joint effusion, and tenderness may not be located at the joint line. The presence of periarticular calcifications on plain radiographs of symptomatic areas are usually sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of calcific periarthritis, and no further diagnostic testing is necessary in typical cases. (See <a href=\"#H1237286225\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selected patients</strong> &ndash; Further imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scanning may be necessary to visualize calcific deposits in deep structures, such as the iliopsoas or retropharyngeal areas, or to more accurately localize calcification in areas where two-dimensional imaging with conventional radiographs is inadequate. (See <a href=\"#H1237286225\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with an atypical presentation, increased concern for infection, or in the absence of radiographic findings of calcification, biopsy of the involved tissues with culture and histopathologic analysis may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

It is most often mistaken for acute gouty arthritis, acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (pseudogout), or infectious arthritis. Each of these is a true arthritis, and thus either physical examination or imaging studies should demonstrate a synovial effusion. Other conditions may also be mistaken for calcific periarthritis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute crystal arthritis (gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition [CPPD] disease) &ndash; Acute pain in the region of the joint may be present with both calcific periarthritis and acute gout or acute CPP arthritis. However, the demographics of gout and pseudogout are quite different from those of calcific periarthritis. Gout typically develops in older men with other comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome, and pseudogout is very rare in people under the age of 60. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Calcified tophi can be confused with periarticular calcifications but typically appear in patients with well-defined gout and have a rim of calcification rather than the cloud-like appearance seen in calcific periarthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious arthritis &ndash; Both infectious arthritis and calcific periarthritis can cause pain and swelling in the region of the joint, as well as fever and chills. Unlike periarthritis, infections that involve the joint are associated with demonstrable joint effusions, and infections involving the soft tissues or bursae rarely cause radiographic calcifications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma &ndash; Calcifications with nearby osseous erosions on radiograph can be mistaken for osteo- or chondrosarcomas. The correct diagnosis is established by biopsy of these lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chondrosarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chondrosarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma and fracture &ndash; Trauma, particularly around the small joints of the hands and feet, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Metatarsal fractures, for example, can present with pain, swelling, and erythema in the forefoot or midfoot without a clear history of injury, similar to the findings of calcific periarthritis. Avulsion fractures may also be confused with calcific periarthritis. Expert review of radiographs or advanced imaging will typically aid in distinguishing a fracture from calcific periarthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of finger, hand, and wrist fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sesamoiditis &ndash; Sesamoiditis, a tendinopathy, can also be confused with calcific periarthritis of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint, and advanced imaging may be required to distinguish between these two entities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial chondromatosis &ndash; Rarely, the calcifications of calcific periarthritis may resemble lesions of synovial chondromatosis. These appear as multiple intraarticular chondral bodies with &quot;ring and arc&quot; chondroid mineralization and extrinsic bony erosions. Symptoms are frequently chronic in synovial chondromatosis, and this may be more common in men.

CT scanning should allow for accurate localization of the calcific density if these alternative diagnoses are entertained. Heterotopic ossification is often considered in the differential diagnosis but has a distinct radiographic appearance with a corticated rim of bone-like tissue around the density. Unusual ossicles can be confused with calcific periarthritis but should have visible trabeculae characteristic of bone. Tissue calcification can also occur after intralesional injections, including glucocorticoid injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-associated-calcific-periarthritis-tendinopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These are typically asymptomatic, and a history of injections at the site of involvement would support this possibility.

Most patients do well with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy alone or with the injection of intralesional glucocorticoids.

(See <a href=\"#H2206598085\" class=\"local\">'Intralesional glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894399864\"><span class=\"h3\">NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs target both pain and inflammation and are the first-line therapy for many patients with calcific periarthritis. In patients with normal renal function and no contraindications to NSAID use, we would begin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (500 mg twice daily). Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (eg, 400 to 600 mg four times daily or 800 mg two to three times daily, with a maximum dose in young healthy individuals of 3200 mg per day) could be used. Protection against gastrointestinal toxicity with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 mg orally twice daily) should be utilized in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal toxicity from NSAIDs who require NSAID therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Secondary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An alternative to a relatively nonselective NSAID in patients poorly tolerant of such agents is the use of an NSAID that is more cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) selective (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> 200 mg twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meloxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meloxicam</a> 7.5 mg daily).</p><p>Treatment should be given for the duration of symptoms. Significant reduction in pain levels and improvement of function after 48 to 72 hours of therapy should be used as an indication of adequate response. This approach is supported by case reports and personal experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2206598085\"><span class=\"h3\">Intralesional glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intralesional glucocorticoids are generally believed to accelerate resolution of symptoms and may act more quickly with fewer side effects than systemic medications. Ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance is warranted in situations where the calcification is not close to the skin surface, such as the hip. Calcific periarthritis around a finger or toe can often be injected without radiographic guidance.</p><p>We use 10 to 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate administered once. The dose should be based on the size of the area involved. Areas around small joints typically have smaller calcifications and lower doses can be used. The use of shorter-acting glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone acetate, minimizes the risk of soft tissue atrophy that may occur with longer-acting glucocorticoids. We typically wait 48 to 72 hours to see an effect on pain and function. This approach is supported by case reports and personal experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H615248636\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistant to initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who do not respond NSAIDs or local glucocorticoid injection, there are several treatment options. Two of these are minimally invasive nonsurgical options, needle aspiration (barbotage) and ESWT, the other is arthroscopic surgery to remove calcific deposits.</p><p>We suggest needle aspiration as the next procedure in patients unresponsive to NSAIDs and injection, and reserve referral for arthroscopic or open surgery to patients refractory to NSAIDs, injection, and needling. All three approaches have been reported as beneficial for calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder; most data are from case series, with only limited and heterogenous randomized trial data.

The most commonly used procedure is also known as barbotage and involves repeated aspiration and injection of the calcific deposit. This is typically performed under ultrasound guidance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The skin is cleaned with betadine and the area is injected with 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> after radiographic confirmation of the location of the deposit. A 22-gauge needle attached to a 20 mL syringe filled with lidocaine mixed with sterile saline is used to break up the calcium deposit. Using repeated injection of the liquid, movement of the needle, and then aspiration, small pieces of the deposit are often visible in the syringe. In many centers, it is performed by musculoskeletal radiologists. The use of this technique for calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder and a summary of the evidence is described in detail separately.

In patients with pain that is refractory to acetaminophen, other pain medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> or opioids, may be necessary, but should be used in the lowest dose and for the shortest time necessary.

BCP crystals can then produce symptoms and mediate tissue damage by several mechanisms, including the induction of an inflammatory response, biomechanical disruption, and direct tissue injury. Trauma, metabolic, and genetic factors may each be associated with increased risk of BCP-associated calcific periarthritis, although most patients are in good general health, and only a portion report recent trauma or overuse. (See <a href=\"#H2203895355\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of BCP-associated musculoskeletal syndromes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1304580297\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcific periarthritis typically causes the acute onset of severe pain involving a single joint, tendon, or bursal area; there is focal tenderness and variable warmth and swelling, sometimes with erythema. It can occur around both large and small joints as well as in the spine. Patients sometimes report fever and chills. Most patients are healthy and middle-aged, with women affected more often than men. The area of tenderness may not correlate with the typical location of the joint line.

Calcifications may be present in tendons, bursae, ligaments, or soft tissues; bone erosions may occur adjacent to the calcific density. Chronic calcifications may be denser and more homogeneous. Calcifications can also be well visualized by ultrasound and by computed tomography (CT). (See <a href=\"#H1237286225\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is based upon a characteristic clinical presentation and typical findings on plain radiographs; with an acute onset of pain and swelling around a single joint, most often in a healthy young or middle-aged woman; no obvious joint effusion; and tenderness that may not be located at the joint line.
