Phobic fears include animals, insects, heights, water, enclosed places, driving, flying, and choking or vomiting. Some specific phobias involve responses to medical procedures, such as injections, dental work, or blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-specific-phobias-of-clinical-procedures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of specific phobias of clinical procedures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific phobias are among the most common mental disorders and can be highly disabling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, they are also among the most treatable mental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Despite availability of efficacious treatments, the majority of individuals with specific phobias are hesitant to seek treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This may be due to lack of knowledge that the phobia is treatable, embarrassment to disclose the phobia to a health professional, accommodation of the phobia through avoidance, or fear of increased anxiety or discomfort in the course of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Pharmacotherapy for specific phobia in adults is discussed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis of specific phobia in adults are also discussed separately. Psychotherapy for specific phobia in adults is also discussed separately. Specific phobias relating to clinical procedures (eg, blood-injection-injury phobia) and other manifestations of acute procedural anxiety are also discussed separately. Specific phobia and other fears in children are also discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-specific-phobia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating specific phobia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>First-line treatment for specific phobia is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that includes exposure treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pharmacotherapy, specifically benzodiazepines have a limited role in treatment of specific phobia. Medications are used when CBT with exposure is not available or feasible, or when patients prefer medication to CBT despite the lack of comparably robust supporting evidence from clinical trials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576036\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662058194\"><span class=\"h2\">Benzodiazepines</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576043\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among medications, benzodiazepines are most often used in the treatment of specific phobia when the phobic stimulus is infrequently encountered and unavoidable, such as in the treatment of a flying phobia. Patients who have experienced intense fear on previous occasions when undertaking these activities may wish to have a reasonable certainty that their anxiety can be lessened if they were to experience the feared stimulus again. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576051\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no rigorous data from clinical trials finding that benzodiazepines are efficacious for specific phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial of 28 women with flying phobia who traveled on two flights over a one-week period found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> led to reduced anxiety but a greater physiologic response on the first flight, compared to placebo, and increased anxiety, physiologic response, and panic on the second flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In our clinical experience, flying phobia anxiety can be managed with benzodiazepines short-term, ie, for the length of a flight. However, well-designed randomized trials are needed to test their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249698686\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A benzodiazepine with a relatively short onset (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 0.5 to 2 mg) can be taken 30 minutes before the stimulus is encountered. A sedating benzodiazepine such as lorazepam is most useful for treating phobias that do not involve performance that could be adversely affected by the medication. </p><p>Patients should be advised to take a test dose prior to using it for the phobic situation to ensure it does not lead to oversedation. Patients should be warned not to consume alcohol and the drug together due to the risk of additive side effects such as sedation, confusion, and impaired coordination.</p><p>Side effects of benzodiazepines include sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, amnesia, and abuse as well as dependence and withdrawal symptoms after long-term treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The risk of abuse of benzodiazepines is largely confined to individuals with a substance abuse history or problem, though a family history of substance abuse may be a risk factor for some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Treating patients who are no longer currently abusing substances with benzodiazepines is not absolutely contraindicated, but would require closer monitoring and, in some cases, the use of longer-acting benzodiazepines with slower onset of action (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>) that may reduce abuse liability. Dose escalation can be discouraged by prescribing a minimal supply of pills for infrequent use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H575961\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is minimal evidence to support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of specific phobias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, SSRIs may be associated with significant side effects (eg, weight gain that may not be easily reversed). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576085\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been only two small trials with mixed results testing SSRIs in specific phobia. Larger trials are needed to determine the efficacy of these medications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared 12 weeks of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> (5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> to placebo in 12 patients with specific phobia (types included enclosed spaces, flying, heights, dentist, and animals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A statistically-significant difference was not seen between the two groups, though a trend in favor of medication was observed in this small trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared four weeks of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> to placebo in 11 patients with specific phobia (types included confined spaces, storms, flying, animals, heights, driving) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients treated with paroxetine showed greater reductions in fear and avoidance compared to the placebo group.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H763500097\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the limited evidence on the efficacy of these drugs in the disorder, we do not recommend any currently for clinical use in the treatment of specific phobias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H575654\"><span class=\"h3\">Cycloserine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cycloserine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cycloserine</a> (DCS), a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist, has been found to effectively augment cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of specific phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and other anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The medication&rsquo;s hypothesized mechanism of action is through facilitation of extinction learning. </p><p>In a randomized trial, 28 subjects with a height phobia were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cycloserine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cycloserine</a> or placebo in augmentation of virtual reality exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A single dose of the medication (either 50 mg or 500 mg) or placebo was administered 30 to 60 minutes prior the exposure session. Patients who received either dosage of cycloserine plus exposure experienced greater reduction in anxiety symptoms of height phobia than patients who received placebo plus exposure; the difference between groups was seen following each treatment session and on assessment three months following treatment. </p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that DCS may be useful principally when taken after successful exposure sessions. In a clinical trial of virtual reality exposure followed by DCS in 15 patients with height phobia, DCS was more likely to reduce anxiety in patients who experienced a positive response to exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H575738\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrocortisone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two trials have found <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, a glucocorticoid, to effectively augment CBT in the treatment of specific phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. While the mechanism of action is not known, endogenous glucocorticoids have been found to be released in persons experiencing fearful situations. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forty patients with a height phobia were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 20 mg taken orally or placebo one hour before each of two sessions of virtual reality exposure-based CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Exposure therapy augmented by hydrocortisone led to a greater reduction in fear of heights compared to placebo-augmented exposure, as assessed following treatment and at a one-month post-treatment. The reduction in anxiety was accompanied by lowered physiological arousal measured by skin conductance (sweating) during the exposure task. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty patients with a spider phobia were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 10 mg taken orally or placebo one hour prior to exposure to a picture of a spider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-specific-phobia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].
