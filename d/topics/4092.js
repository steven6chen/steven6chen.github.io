(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neuroblastomas, which account for 97 percent of all neuroblastic tumors, are heterogeneous, varying in terms of location, histopathologic appearance, and biologic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are most remarkable for their broad spectrum of clinical behavior, which can range from spontaneous regression, to maturation to a benign ganglioneuroma, or aggressive disease with metastatic dissemination leading to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Clinical diversity correlates closely with numerous clinical and biological factors (including patient age, tumor stage and histology, and genetic and chromosomal abnormalities). For example, most infants with disseminated disease have a favorable outcome following treatment with chemotherapy and surgery, although the majority of children older than one year of age with advanced-stage disease die from progressive disease despite intensive multimodality therapy. This clinical complexity likely derives from the developmental origins of neuroblastoma, which arises due to developmental arrest of maturing components of the embryonic neural crest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Neuroblastoma has been associated with central hypoventilation, Hirschsprung disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (neurocristopathy syndrome), and as a familial disorder associated with mutations in the ALK gene. These are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-neuroblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of neuroblastoma will be presented here.

The adrenal gland is the most common primary site (40 percent), followed by abdominal (25 percent), thoracic (15 percent), cervical (5 percent), and pelvic sympathetic ganglia (5 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72000 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Less commonly, tumors arise within the central or autonomic nervous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In approximately 1 percent of cases, a primary tumor cannot be identified. Neuroblastoma metastasizes to lymph nodes, bone marrow, cortical bone, dura, orbits, liver, and skin, and less frequently to pulmonary and intracranial sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79453\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79453 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62275\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62275 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting symptoms reflect the location of the primary tumor and the extent of metastatic disease, if present.

Abdominal tumors can present with abdominal pain or fullness, abdominal mass, or rarely intestinal obstruction. When the primary tumor arises from the organs of Zuckerkandl (a pair of embryonic organs that persist until shortly after birth and are located near the aortic bifurcation), the child may have symptoms related to compression of the bowel or bladder (eg, constipation, reduced bladder capacity, enuresis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Large abdominal tumors also can compress venous or lymphatic drainage, leading to scrotal and lower extremity edema. A sudden and dramatic increase in tumor size with abdominal distention and discomfort can result from spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>An abdominal mass may be detected in an asymptomatic child by the primary care clinician during a routine examination. In a review of malignant abdominal masses diagnosed at a children's hospital, the mass was detected by the primary care provider during a well-child or brief acute-care visit in 11 percent of cases, highlighting the importance of the abdominal examination in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mass is typically, but not always, nontender, fixed, and firm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Thoracic tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary thoracic tumors may be detected incidentally on radiographs obtained in the evaluation of other complaints (eg, respiratory symptoms, trauma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Paravertebral tumors'</a> below). Mediastinal tumors can cause tracheal deviation or narrowing with resultant stridor, although high thoracic and cervical masses may be associated with a Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=horner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Horner syndrome&quot;</a>). Large thoracic tumors, usually associated with mechanical obstruction, may cause the superior vena cava syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Paravertebral tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because neuroblastomas may arise from paravertebral sympathetic ganglia (paraganglia), primary tumors (usually in the retroperitoneum or mediastinum) are able to invade the spinal canal through the neural foramina, creating a so-called &quot;dumbbell&quot; tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72000 \">image 1</a>). The subsequent epidural spinal cord compression, an oncologic emergency, can cause pain, motor or sensory deficits, or loss of bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder control. The subtle and gradual onset of such neurologic symptoms in young children can make diagnosis difficult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Involvement of the cervical paravertebral sympathetic chain and inferior cervical (stellate) ganglion can result in the Horner syndrome (ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=horner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Horner syndrome&quot;</a>). Heterochromia iridis (different colors of the iris or portions of the iris) is common among infants who have congenital Horner syndrome, but also occurs in acquired cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one retrospective review of 405 cases of neuroblastoma, unilateral Horner syndrome was present in 14 children (3 percent) and was the presenting sign in nine (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Infants with an isolated, congenital Horner syndrome should undergo careful examination for cervical and abdominal masses, as well as a measurement of urinary catecholamine metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Radiologic evaluation of the head, neck, and chest is warranted for those who have acquired Horner syndrome, or whose Horner syndrome is associated with other signs (eg, increasing heterochromia, cervical mass, other cranial nerve palsies). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Screening for neuroblastoma'</a> below.)</p><p>In a retrospective review of 23 infants with an isolated Horner syndrome, urinary VMA was measured in 21, and radiographic imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of the chest and neck undertaken in 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Previously undetected pathology was found in two infants (one with cervical neuroblastoma and another with a benign ganglioneuroma of the left pulmonary apex); a third had been diagnosed with abdominal neuroblastoma before presenting for evaluation of Horner syndrome. Four infants were thought to have birth trauma as an explanation for their Horner syndrome, and no underlying cause was identified among the remaining 16; no additional pathology developed among these patients after a mean 9.3 years of follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Catecholamine secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As neuroblastoma is derived from neural crest cells that are destined to form components of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, they frequently express both the norepinephrine transporter gene (NAT, making them metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG] avid) and the enzymes required for catecholamine metabolism. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Staging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Degradation of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine lead to the final end products VMA and HVA. Elevated levels of VMA and HVA can be detected in the serum and urine of approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients with neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Testing for these products using high-performance liquid chromatography or other methods can thus be a highly sensitive and specific aid in making the diagnosis of a variety of neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Almost 50 percent of children with OMA have an underlying neuroblastoma; neurologic symptoms precede tumor diagnosis in about half of these. The disorder is believed to have an autoimmune pathogenesis.</p><p>The characteristic symptoms of OMA are rapid, dancing eye movements, rhythmic jerking (myoclonus) involving limbs or trunk, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ataxia.</p><p>All children with OMA must be evaluated for neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If the initial evaluation is unrevealing, it should be repeated in several months.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of paraneoplastic OMA are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opsoclonus-myoclonus-syndrome#H24047689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pediatric syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Secretion of VIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autonomous tumor secretion of VIP is another paraneoplastic syndrome that is rarely associated with neuroblastoma. VIP secretion can cause abdominal distension and intractable secretory diarrhea with associated hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; these symptoms usually resolve after removal of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of a VIP-secreting tumor is established by the presence of an otherwise unexplained high-volume secretory diarrhea and a serum VIP concentration in excess of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. A single elevated VIP level should be confirmed by additional testing. VIP-producing tumors are more often the less aggressive ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas rather than undifferentiated neuroblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vipoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroblastoma metastasizes by both lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Regional lymph node involvement is found in 35 percent of children who have apparently localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Involvement of lymph nodes outside the cavity or region of origin (ie, abdomen, thorax, pelvis) is considered to represent disseminated disease.</p><p>Hematogenous spread extends most often to bone, bone marrow, skin, and liver. Metastatic involvement of the liver is common in infants and can cause respiratory compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Neuroblastomas also may spread to lung and brain parenchyma, but this usually occurs as a manifestation of relapsing or end-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Metastatic spread to the bones and bone marrow can cause pain (especially with ambulation), blood count abnormalities, and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22-24</a>]. In young children, who cannot complain of pain, bone pain may manifest as a limp or unexplained irritability. Tumor infiltration of the periorbital bones, typically unilateral, can cause the characteristic periorbital ecchymosis (&quot;raccoon eyes&quot;), ptosis, and proptosis. In one retrospective review of 405 cases of neuroblastoma, proptosis or periorbital ecchymosis was present in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Metastatic spread to the skin manifests as papules or subcutaneous nodules that can be distributed over the entire body. These lesions are present in approximately one-third of children with congenital neuroblastoma and are typically described as firm, bluish-red, and non-tender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The lesions have a distinctive response to rubbing, characterized by central blanching with a surrounding halo of erythema that persists for 30 to 60 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The differential diagnosis of skin nodules is presented below. Rigorous evaluation is important to determine the etiology of the nodules so that the child can be appropriately treated. Children with skin nodules that are biopsy-proven to be neuroblastoma should undergo a full tumor evaluation by an oncologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstetrical sonography has been used with increasing frequency over the past three decades. As the ease and accuracy of third-trimester imaging has improved, and the indications for these studies have broadened, the incidence of prenatal diagnosis of neuroblastoma has risen steadily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Prenatally detected adrenal masses typically are found during ultrasonographic examinations performed after 32 weeks gestation, with the earliest observed at 18 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. More than 55 cases of antenatal neuroblastoma have been reported in the literature since the original report in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. One hundred children per year in North America are diagnosed with neuroblastoma either prenatally or at younger than three months of age. Because most of these tumors are present antepartum, the incidence of prenatal diagnosis is likely to continue to rise.</p><p>If an adrenal tumor was detected on prenatal ultrasonography performed for unrelated reasons and the fetus was otherwise progressing normally, repeat ultrasonography after delivery should be performed. Urine catecholamines also may be helpful in distinguishing a neuroblastoma from other potential masses including adrenal hemorrhage and vascular malformations, although a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma includes a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions and varies according to tumor location. Distinguishing these conditions from neuroblastoma may be particularly difficult in patients whose tumors do not produce catecholamines or who do not have an obvious primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>When the tumor arises in a suprarenal location, Wilms' tumor and hepatoblastoma should be considered. In thoracic and retroperitoneal locations, lymphoma, germ cell tumors, and infection should be considered. Metastatic involvement of the bone marrow must be distinguished from lymphoma, small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia, particularly megakaryoblastic leukemia. If the spinal canal is involved, either as a metastatic lesion or by extension of the primary tumor, the differential diagnosis should extend to other neurodevelopmental tumors such as desmoid tumors, epidermoid tumors, and teratomas, as well as astrocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome may occur in association with other conditions besides neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/34-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors &ndash; Hepatoblastoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections &ndash; Poliovirus, parainfluenza virus, coxsackie virus B3 and B2, Epstein-Barr virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, salmonella, Lyme disease, rickettsia, syphilis, psittacosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestions &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, cocaine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic exposures &ndash; Toluene, thallium, organophosphates, chlordecone, strychnine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic derangements &ndash; Biotin-responsive multiple carboxylase deficiency, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis of skin nodules in newborns and infants includes dermoid and other cysts, subcutaneous fat necrosis, benign tumors (eg, infantile myofibromatosis, congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis), and other malignant tumors (eg, infantile fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and congenital leukemia).

Evaluation of urine or serum catecholamine metabolite levels, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA) should be obtained to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of disease response, since levels are elevated in greater than 90 percent of patients with neuroblastoma. In addition, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations may be helpful; they may be elevated initially and can be expected to return to normal during adequate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H898865188\"><span class=\"h3\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic confirmation is required for definitive diagnosis. Tissue is usually obtained by incisional biopsy of the primary tumor or bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">biopsy/aspirate</span> in patients who are suspected to have metastatic disease in the marrow. The nature and extent of the initial diagnostic procedure for a child with suspected neuroblastoma should be decided only after consultation with a pediatric surgeon and oncologist who are familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of neuroblastoma.</p><p>For tumors that appear to be localized and resectable without substantial morbidity, the initial diagnostic procedure may include a complete or near-complete resection of the primary tumor and sampling of non-adherent ipsilateral and contralateral lymph nodes. The initial procedure should not include resection of vital structures (eg, kidney, spleen) or major motor or sensory nerves (the section of which would lead to permanent disability).</p><p>Bone marrow disease is evaluated by aspiration and biopsy of the bone marrow, usually at the posterior iliac crests. Two separate sites are assayed, resulting in four samples (two aspirations, two biopsies). If any of the four assays demonstrate tumor cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73187 \">picture 1</a>), the bone marrow is considered positive for disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. All four assays must be without evidence of tumor for the bone marrow to be considered clear. In a subset of cases, bone marrow biopsy may not be sufficient to guide therapy because it does not provide information about the histologic grade of the primary tumor.</p><p>Tumor tissue or bone marrow, if positive for tumor, must be evaluated for status of the gene MYCN and DNA ploidy, preferably at a centralized laboratory if the treating institution does not routinely perform these analyses. Proper handling of the tissues after biopsy is crucial in determining treatment. Thus, biopsy should be undertaken with the guidance of a pediatric oncologist whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1654334001\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine catecholamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroblastoma tumor cells take up and metabolize catecholamines, and the resulting degradation products can be detected in serum and urine. Urinary HVA and VMA levels are useful for both diagnosis and for monitoring disease activity over time. Screening programs for neuroblastoma using urine catecholamines are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Screening for neuroblastoma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118799637\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimum criteria for establishing a diagnosis of neuroblastoma have been agreed upon by an international consensus panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A definitive diagnosis of neuroblastoma requires one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unequivocal histologic diagnosis from tumor tissue by light microscopy, with or without immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, or increased urine (or serum) catecholamines or their metabolites</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of metastases to bone marrow on an aspirate or trephine biopsy <strong>with</strong> concomitant elevation of urinary or serum catecholamines or their metabolites</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete evaluation of patients with suspected neuroblastoma is mandatory before beginning treatment. The evaluation is best completed at a major pediatric cancer center where pediatric oncologists and radiologists familiar with neuroblastoma can be closely involved in the planning and coordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The goal is to evaluate the extent of disease, which, in turn, determines the clinical and pathologic stage, treatment, and, to a great extent, prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1781832804\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING SYSTEM</span></p><p>Neuroblastomas are now staged using the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS), which was originally developed as part of an international collaboration to define risk based on image-defined risk factors (IDRF). These IDRF connote tumor infiltration or encasement of vital structures and correlate with the ability to achieve complete resection. Pretreatment IDRF are combined with presence or absence of metastatic spread and yield a stage for every patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108061 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These stages are then combined with patient age and tumor biological characteristics to assign the patient to a specific risk group. This approach was compared with the previous International Neuroblastoma Staging System was found to be more uniformly applicable across all patient cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. As noted below, complete and standardized imaging including metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning is required for optimal staging of neuroblastoma patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT or MRI &ndash;</strong> While ultrasonography (US) is often the initial radiologic study in the evaluation of a child with an abdominal mass, evaluation of the primary tumor site and nodal sites of metastatic disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must also be performed in suspected cases of neuroblastoma. Extension of imaging into chest and pelvis may be required in cases of retroperitoneal primary disease that can extend into these cavities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT or MRI of the primary tumor may reveal a heterogeneous mass, possibly containing calcifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78302 \">image 4</a>). When the mass is adjacent to the spine, an MRI is particularly helpful for evaluation of spinal canal invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72000 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>I123-MIBG scan</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> Evaluation for metastatic bone disease is required for patients with diagnosed neuroblastoma. For such patients, I123 MIBG is preferred to technetium scan for evaluation of the bone, given its higher sensitivity and specificity for detection of metastatic disease. Among patients with known neuroblastoma, I123 MIBG has a sensitivity of approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p>MIBG is a chemical analog of norepinephrine that is selectively concentrated in sympathetic nervous tissues such as neuroblastoma. It can be labeled with radioactive iodine and imaged by scintigraphy. The MIBG scan is both sensitive and specific for neuroblastoma and is recommended at diagnosis and repeat evaluations of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/45,49-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,49-54</a>]. Because radioactive iodine is used, the thyroid gland must be protected by the simultaneous administration of nonradioactive iodine (eg, potassium iodide). When MIBG is used for treatment, thyroid dysfunction has been reported as a potential complication in up to 64 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. The addition of thyroxine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> to potassium iodide, and continuation of thyroid protection for four weeks after the last dose of radiolabeled MIBG, may be effective in preventing thyroid dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Rarely, bone metastases may be suspected despite a negative MIBG, for example, if bone marrow biopsy demonstrates disease. In such cases, a radionuclide bone scan is a sensitive tool for evaluating metastatic spread to cortical bone, although it is not routinely recommended given that it lacks specificity. Plain radiographs are not as sensitive as bone scans because of the degree of cortical bone destruction needed to visualize a lesion on plain film. However, false-negative bone scan results may occur in patients with lytic metastases within the distal end of long bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In addition, in infants younger than one year of age, bone scans may be difficult to interpret because immobilization is difficult, and improper knee positioning (on account of slight knee flexion and external rotation of the leg) may cause superimposition of the epiphysis and metaphysis, obscuring the usual tracer concentration gradients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Thus, plain radiographs (eg, a skeletal survey) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82510 \">table 2</a>) may be necessary in young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy &ndash;</strong> Evaluation of bone marrow with bilateral iliac crest core biopsies should be performed and must contain at least 1 cm of marrow, excluding cartilage, to be considered adequate. (See <a href=\"#H898865188\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Additionally, a head CT should be pursued for patients presenting with proptosis, periorbital ecchymoses, or as clinically indicated by symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR NEUROBLASTOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because outcome is significantly better for patients with localized disease and younger age, several groups have attempted to develop screening programs for neuroblastoma in infancy by measuring urinary catecholamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. The aim of these studies has been to ascertain whether earlier detection would decrease the incidence of high-risk or advanced-stage disease and ultimately improve survival.</p><p>Four large studies from Japan, Canada, Austria, and Europe have screened over 10 million children at either six to seven months or one year of age. The incidence of neuroblastoma diagnosis was compared with historic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], unscreened children from the same country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], or unscreened populations in other cities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/60,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,62</a>]. All of these studies were remarkably similar:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening led to more neuroblastomas being diagnosed in the screened population; however, the additional tumors were mainly low-stage tumors with favorable biologic features. Many of these tumors presumably would have undergone spontaneous regression and never would have been diagnosed clinically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no decrease in the incidence of high-risk tumors in children beyond the age of screening (ie, older than one year of age).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was not lower in the screened populations.</p><p/><p>These observations were supported in a pilot study of observation in Japanese infants with neuroblastoma detected through mass screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Infants were eligible for inclusion if their tumors were stage I or II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73974 \">table 3</a>), less than 5 cm in diameter, and did not involve large vessels or organs. Immediate resection was performed for increase in size, elevation of tumor markers, or evidence of metastasis. Spontaneous regression occurred in 13 of 22 cases (59 percent); eight of the remaining tumors were resected for increase in size, elevation of tumor markers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parental request; and one tumor was resected at the parents' request. Among the resected tumors, five had favorable biologic features. All patients survived without recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma&quot;, section on 'Prognostic factors'</a>.)</p><p>An adverse impact of screening was suggested in the study from Canada, in which 2 of the 43 patients whose tumors were detected by screening had significant adverse effects because of treatment for their favorable-prognosis neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Another study demonstrated that expectant observation of infants younger than six months with small adrenal masses resulted in favorable event-free and overall survival outcomes for most patients, while also avoiding surgical morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for neuroblastoma with urine catecholamines does not reduce mortality.
