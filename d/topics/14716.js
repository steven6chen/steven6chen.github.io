It is comprised of broad concepts that affect global life satisfaction, including good health, adequate housing, employment, personal and family safety, interrelationships, education, and leisure pursuits. For matters related to health care, the term QOL has been applied specifically to those life concerns that are most affected by health or illness. Patients contemplating hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), like any other major medical intervention, often question what the quality of their lives will be following the procedure. The success of HCT has resulted in a large number of patients becoming long term survivors, bringing the issue of QOL to the forefront [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Clearly, the long-term effects of HCT, and the attendant QOL of long-term survivors, are due to the complete treatment program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54359 \">table 1</a>), not just to the transplant itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic support after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the general issue of QOL in HCT donors, survivors of HCT, and their caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Complication- or disease-specific long-term issues, such as the development of malignancy following HCT and care of the long term survivor, are discussed separately.

Pre-transplant QOL (reflecting physical, emotional, or role-performing impairments caused by the underlying disease) is reached or surpassed for most patients in the months and years following autologous HCT. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

A significant minority report psychosocial stress and issues related to strength, body image, and sexual satisfaction that may be at least partially mitigated by the incorporation of an exercise program before, during, and after HCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the factor with the most influence on QOL after HCT. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chronic graft-versus-host disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The long-term effects of HCT, and the attendant QOL of long-term survivors, are due to the complete treatment program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54359 \">table 1</a>), not just to the transplant itself.

To assess this issue, a small study of 28 adults evaluated physical and psychosocial status prior to and 12 to 16 months following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Few significant differences were noted, but an inspection of residual change scores suggested that physical and psychosocial status improved following HCT for some individuals, while declining for others. Males and older patients at the time of HCT reported the largest declines in physical and psychosocial status.</p><p>The first study evaluating survivors of allogeneic HCT revealed that the majority of patients were employed and in reasonably good health, with acceptable objective and subjective function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Subsequent reports have confirmed that the QOL of long term survivors following HCT is generally excellent, with &gt;90 percent of patients enjoying Karnofsky performance scores of 80 percent or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23-26</a>]. Approximately 10 to 15 percent report significant evidence of psychosocial stress:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survey-based study of 125 adult patients assessed QOL 6 to 18 years (mean 10 years) following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Eighty percent of patients reported good to excellent QOL. Seventy-four percent of patients reported that their QOL was better at the time of evaluation than prior to the transplant, and 88 percent reported that the benefits of the procedure outweighed the side effects. However, approximately 5 percent had emotional and sexual dysfunction, as well as lingering pain and cognitive dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another questionnaire-based study of over 170 adult survivors of transplantation 6 to 149 months after transplant received responses from 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These patients had a relatively high degree of perceived overall QOL, with multiple measures assessed. The major limitations were related to physical functioning, including strength, body image and sexual satisfaction. Sexual problems were also identified as a concern in another study of HCT survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective trial of 67 patients evaluated QOL measures at baseline, 90 days, one year, and 4.5 years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Physical functioning was found to be most impaired at the 90-day time point. By one year following HCT, most patients had returned to pre-transplant levels of function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective, multicenter review of 798 patients undergoing HCT reported that 93 percent of patients who had survived for longer than five years were in good health, and 89 percent had returned to full-time work or school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of functional status found that, when compared with their siblings, long-term allogeneic HCT survivors were more likely to report difficulty in holding jobs and in obtaining life or health insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a group of 244 patients with a median age of 28 in long-term remission, who were studied at a median follow-up of five years, QOL was assessed to be good, intermediate, or poor in 25, 44, and 31 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Females had significantly poorer scores when compared with males in the sexual and psychological domains. Factors significantly associated with a poor QOL on multivariate analysis included age &gt;25 at the time of transplant, the presence of long-term sequelae, the presence of chronic GVHD, and time from transplant less than five years.</p><p/><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving QOL after HCT. A multicenter study of 105 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT randomly assigned individuals to a partially supervised exercise program or to a social contact control activity before, during, and continuing for six to eight weeks after discharge from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. When compared with the control patients, patients assigned to exercise had significantly better ratings on measures of fatigue, physical fitness, and global distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic graft-versus-host disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the major factor limiting QOL in recipients of allogeneic HCT has generally been chronic GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3,26,33,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26,33,35-37</a>]. In one health questionnaire study of 584 individuals who had survived two or more years following allogeneic HCT, the overall incidence of chronic GVHD was 54 percent; only 46 percent of those with a history of chronic GVHD reported active disease at the time of the survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subjects with active chronic GVHD were more likely to report adverse general and mental health, functional impairments, activity limitation, and pain than were those with no history of chronic GVHD. Of importance, health status did not differ between those with resolved chronic GVHD and those who never had this complication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Unrelated donor transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two studies have described QOL issues in a total of 48 patients surviving more than one year after unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Overall QOL was judged to be good to excellent in both groups, with 75 percent of patients returning to full- or part-time work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Psychosocial adjustment was most impaired in the areas of sexual relationships, vocational and social adjustment, and psychological distress; dysfunction was more common in females and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Fatigue, present in almost 80 percent of patients, was the most common symptom interfering with daily life; this symptom was associated with the presence of anxiety, pain, infection, and weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation during childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study compared cognitive, educational, and psychosocial outcomes, and QOL of pediatric HCT survivors with those of their siblings at two years post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Except for some deficits in educational outcomes and physical QOL, survivors' cognitive and psychological outcomes were similar to those of their siblings. Family and clinical factors were identified as critical for these outcomes.</p><p>A QOL questionnaire study was performed in 98 disease-free survivors over the age of 17 who had survived &gt;3 years after transplant. Results were compared with a control group of 58 healthy subjects of similar age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Transplant survivors, in comparison with controls, reported fewer problems regarding interpersonal relationships, sleep, depression, and leisure activities, and greater problems with physical appearance, school studies, and work possibilities.</p><p>A number of risk factors (eg, diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, presence of GVHD, intensity of therapy, cranial irradiation, prior health, age, and sex, maternal distress) appear to be important for determining the long-term behavioral, social, and educational outcomes in these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARATIVE STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have compared QOL in patients receiving autologous versus allogeneic HCT, as well as HCT versus more conventional combination chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous versus allogeneic transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one study, patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous transplantation who were alive at 12 months following the transplant were compared.

Greater age, lower level of education, and more advanced disease at the time of HCT were identified as risk factors for poorer QOL. Interestingly, not identified as risk factors in this study were disease diagnosis, dose of total body irradiation, presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), type of GVHD prophylaxis, or degree of donor matching. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Autologous transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p>In a longitudinal study, although autologous transplant patients had better event-free and overall survival, fewer symptoms, and more complete recovery at six months, these advantages had largely equalized by 12 months post-transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In a prospective study, QOL comparisons were made between patients with refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC, 62 patients) or autologous bone marrow (29 patients) transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Significant differences in QOL using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist were all in favor of PBPC, both at 14 days post-transplantation and at three months post-discharge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Allogeneic HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a case control study of the relative efficacy of stem cell sources for sibling allografts, global QOL did not differ between recipients of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, perhaps because of the higher incidence of chronic GVHD in those receiving peripheral blood stem cells, there was a significant impairment of role and social functioning in this group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation versus chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A QOL study compared 91 patients who were undergoing HCT with 73 patients with hematologic malignancies who were matched for age, post-treatment duration, sociodemographic and disease characteristics who underwent treatment with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The HCT patients reported good to excellent QOL and in some domains even better QOL than that reported by the chemotherapy patients. However, approximately 20 percent of the HCT patients had lingering problems, including failure to return to work or school, symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as decreased sexual and body image satisfaction.</p><p>Issues concerning sexual function were investigated further in 479 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission, who had been entered into a trial comparing intensive chemotherapy with allogeneic and autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Significantly more transplant than chemotherapy patients reported a decrease in interest in sex, sexual activity, pleasure from sex, and ability to have sex (p&lt;0.001 for each). Hormonal disorders and infertility were also more common in the transplant group. These differences were more apparent in women, and remained after adjustment for age.</p><p>QOL issues were evaluated at one year in patients treated on a UK Medical Research Council AML10 trial comparing HCT with chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. More patients receiving HCT had mouth dryness problems and worse sexual and social relationships, professional, and leisure activities than those treated with chemotherapy.

The men and women in the study did not differ in sexual satisfaction pre-transplant. Eighty percent of women, and 29 percent of men reported at least one sexual problem at three years. However, no pre-transplant variables were significant predictors of sexual satisfaction in women at three years.

A minimum of 45 patients were evaluated at each time point with several different instruments. The trend for overall QOL was parabolic, worsening at the time of discharge, and improving at 100 days and one year. However, approximately 20 percent of patients continued to have problems of psychosocial distress at one year following HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Individual areas of problems and concerns were identified which were worse over time, suggesting that psychosocial interventions may be useful (eg, treatment of depression) before and after transplantation, in order to prepare patients for increasing and worsening concerns, even after physical wellbeing has improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,56</a>]. Two studies are of interest in this regard:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, patients surviving at least six months after HCT with symptoms of depression had a poorer QOL and a threefold higher risk of death in the subsequent six months (95% CI 1.1-8.3) than those without these complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study in 199 hematologic cancer patients surviving at least 90 days after HCT, the incidence of major and minor depression was 9 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Major, but not minor, depression predicted for significantly higher one- and three-year, but not five-year, mortality with hazard ratios of 2.6, 2.0, and 1.5, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health-related QOL outcomes were evaluated up to two years post-pediatric HCT through questionnaires given to 99 mothers of these children. Although significant improvement in physical and psychosocial health-related QOL from pre-HCT to one or two years post-HCT was reported, older surviving children whose mothers were younger, distressed, and had lower education levels at the time of HCT had compromised health-related QOL compared with other survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Three to five years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a continual improvement in QOL with time after transplant, extending well beyond one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. As one example, QOL was judged to be good to excellent in almost 90 percent of patients at three years post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In another study, QOL was good to intermediate in 62 percent of patients at less than five years post-transplant, increasing to 76 percent at &gt;5 years post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study of patients with aplastic anemia followed up to 26 years post-transplant, 83 percent had returned to school or work at two years; this proportion increased to 90 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>A longitudinal study evaluated 319 adults with leukemia or lymphoma before their first myeloablative HCT, and followed them for as long as five years for such outcomes as physical limitations, depression, levels of distress, and return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical limitation reached a peak at 90 days after HCT, followed by improvement at one year and no further significant change at three and five years. The proportion of patients without physical limitations was 19 and 63 percent at one and five years, respectively. Pre-HCT predictors of long-term physical limitation included higher medical risk, depression, and radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment distress was high before and at 90 days after HCT and decreased steadily thereafter. Distress declined more rapidly between pre-transplantation and the three-year evaluation period in patients who received autologous rather than allogeneic HCT as well as those who had more social support prior to HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean scores for depression at 90 days were unchanged from baseline, while scores at one, three, and five years were lower, with no change after the first year.

This was illustrated in a telephone interview study of 662 disease-free HCT survivors studied at a mean of seven years posttransplant (range: 1.8 to 23 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. When compared with a healthy control group of acquaintances, HCT survivors reported poorer physical, psychological, and social functioning, but more psychological and interpersonal growth.</p><p>In a study of 137 survivors and non-transplant controls at 10 years post-HCT, survivors reported significantly more medical problems, including musculoskeletal complaints, cataract surgery, hepatitis, sexual problems, restrictions in social function, memory and attention concerns, urinary frequency or leaking, use of psychotropic mediation, and denial of life and health insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Of interest, transplant survivors and controls did not differ in self-reported rates of osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, employment, marital satisfaction, divorce, or psychological health.</p><p>Clearly, experiencing such profound events as a life-threatening illness followed by treatment with HCT has a major impact on life events, both good and bad. These effects and the potential for personal and interpersonal growth should be discussed with patients and their families. In addition, the need for professional intervention should be discussed at early times of stress and dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">QOL IN HEMATOPOIETIC CELL DONORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a few trials have reported outcome data beyond three months for donors of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Japanese study evaluated QOL in 565 donors undergoing and recovering from the harvesting of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Virtually all donors received general anesthesia for a mean duration of 127 minutes, with removal of a mean volume of 13.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> and transfusion of one unit of autologous blood. Median length of hospitalization after harvest was 48 hours; 98 percent of donors were discharged within 72 hours. QOL was assessed via a health survey form (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36) completed at three different times: before harvest, one week after hospital discharge, and three months after discharge. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before harvest, all eight subscores (eg, physical functioning, bodily pain, social functioning, mental health) were significantly higher than the Japanese national norms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One week after discharge, mean scores on physical functioning, role-physical (RP, limitations in doing work or other daily activities), and bodily pain were approximately one standard deviation below the Japanese national norms.

QOL comprises broad concepts that affect global life satisfaction, including good health, adequate housing, employment, personal and family safety, interrelationships, education, and leisure pursuits. For matters related to health care, the term QOL has been applied to those life concerns that are most affected by health or illness. The long-term effects of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and the attendant QOL of long-term survivors, are due to the complete treatment program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54359 \">table 1</a>), not just to the transplant itself. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QOL among patients who have undergone autologous HCT is generally excellent. Pre-transplant QOL (reflecting physical, emotional, or role-performing impairments caused by the underlying disease) is reached or surpassed for most patients in the months and years following autologous HCT. The major cause of morbidity and mortality beyond the first several months following the transplant is relapse of the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Autologous transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT are employed and in reasonably good health, with acceptable objective and subjective function. A significant minority report psychosocial stress and issues related to strength, body image, and sexual satisfaction. Chronic GVHD is perhaps the factor with the most influence on QOL after HCT and affects approximately half of long-term survivors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a continual improvement in QOL with time after allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Improvement as a function of time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic cell donors experience short term side effects, such as bone discomfort, but have normal long-term QOL. When compared with peripheral blood stem cell donors, bone marrow donors experience more overall adverse effects, more days of restricted activity, and are more likely to require hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'QOL in hematopoietic cell donors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spouses or partners of HCT survivors may be at increased risk for long-term fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'QOL in spouses and partners'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lee SJ, Joffe S, Kim HT, et al.
