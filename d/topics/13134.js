The diagnosis of PCOS has life-long implications, with increased risk for infertility, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and possibly for cardiovascular disease and endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. PCOS is diagnosed in adolescents with otherwise unexplained, persistent hyperandrogenic anovulatory symptoms that are inappropriate for age and stage of adolescence. It should be considered in any adolescent girl with hirsutism, treatment-resistant acne, menstrual irregularity, or acanthosis nigricans, and evidence of these signs and symptoms should be especially sought in patients being evaluated for obesity.

The pathogenesis of PCOS can be envisioned according to a &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis, whereby the disorder arises as a congenitally programmed predisposition (&quot;first hit&quot;) that becomes manifest in the presence of a provocative factor (&quot;second hit&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111333 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The congenital factors can be either hereditary (genetic) or acquired (eg, maternal drugs or nutritional disorders affecting the fetus). The postnatal provocative factor usually is insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism, which may have been congenitally programmed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acquired postnatally due to simple (exogenous) obesity. </p><p>These complex interactions generally mimic an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with variable penetrance. Heritability of PCOS has been estimated at over 70 percent, based on studies in identical twin sisters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>PCOS represents an evolutionary paradox: although it is an infertility disorder, it is very common across populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One reasonable explanation for this paradox is that PCOS developed through natural selection because it was advantageous during times of nutritional deprivation, since the condition helps to preserve anabolism and reproductive capacity via increased androgen and insulin production. By contrast, in current times of plentiful nutrition and obesity, this phenotype is disadvantageous. One of the great mysteries about the etiology of PCOS is the nature of the common denominator that underlies ovarian hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and obesity. Considerable basic research will be necessary to discern this. Understanding of the pathophysiology is summarized in the following sections; more information is available from the references and a detailed review article [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3142989519\"><span class=\"h2\">Heritable traits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heritable traits that are PCOS risk factors include maternal PCOS, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), hyperandrogenemia, and metabolic syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536635003\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal PCOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal PCOS is a risk factor for PCOS in daughters; approximately 25 percent of females with PCOS have a mother with PCOS, although estimates vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The largest long-term prospective study compared the daughters of 99 women with PCOS (defined by National Institutes of Health [NIH] criteria) with those of 88 control women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels emerged peripubertally, and higher basal testosterone and higher 17-OHP responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHag) testing emerged during the late stages of puberty. One-half of the daughters of women with PCOS who were postmenarcheal had higher testosterone levels than any daughters in a control group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2599052188\"><span class=\"h3\">Polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCOM refers to the ultrasonographic polycystic changes in the ovary that are variably associated with PCOS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H768363691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a>). This characteristic seems to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion in PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In our study of 35 families with an adolescent PCOS proband (by NIH criteria), most adolescents had either a mother with PCOM (22 percent), usually without PCOS symptoms, or a parent with metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"#H451685201\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic syndrome'</a> below). In a study of the sisters of women with PCOM who met the broad Rotterdam criteria for PCOS (80 percent of whom were clinically hyperandrogenic), 70.5 percent of sisters had PCOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the sisters with PCOM, 25 percent had hyperandrogenic anovulation (ie, PCOS by the highly specific NIH criteria) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>), 42 percent had either hirsutism or oligomenorrhea (ie, meeting less specific criteria for PCOS), and 33 percent were asymptomatic. The group of sisters with PCOM resembled their proband sisters in both androgenic and glucose-metabolic traits, indicating significant heritability and cosegregation of these traits. </p><p>These and other genetic studies do not include data on the steroidogenic function of a polycystic ovary, which varies substantially among individuals with PCOM. About one-half of apparently normal females with PCOM have subclinical biochemical evidence of ovarian androgenic dysfunction, which has been proposed to represent a carrier state for PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692268526\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperandrogenemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-half of sisters of PCOS probands have an elevated serum testosterone level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, only one-half of these sisters with excess androgen have menstrual irregularity, and the other one-half are asymptomatic. This is consistent with the concept that a modest degree of hyperandrogenemia is not sufficient to account for ovarian dysfunction in the absence of another predisposing or precipitating factor(s). </p><p>First-degree male relatives have also been reported to have subtle excesses of adrenal steroids and serum luteinizing hormone (LH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451685201\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic syndrome (a cluster of central obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) and its core pathogenetic constituents, insulin resistance and obesity, have heritable components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>).

This was illustrated in our series of 35 families in which an adolescent girl had PCOS (by NIH criteria): 70 percent of the probands had a parent with metabolic syndrome (53 to 79 percent of fathers and 34 to 37 percent of mothers were affected, depending on the criteria used) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Obesity or overweight was found in 94 percent of fathers and 66 percent of mothers. Abnormal glucose tolerance was present in 84 percent of fathers and 49 percent of mothers; most of these were asymptomatic. In this series, there was complete concordance between paternal metabolic syndrome and PCOM in their proband daughter, but no relationship to metabolic syndrome in these daughters; this suggests a fundamental relationship of metabolic syndrome to the PCOM of PCOS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1972857802\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ongoing research aims to identify specific genes that underlie the intrinsic cause of PCOS. A wide variety of gene variants with linkage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> association with PCOS have been identified by candidate gene and molecular genetic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and novel markers are reported regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Polymorphisms, linkages, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differential expression have been reported for genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes, sex hormone-binding globulin, the androgen receptor, transcription factors, and gonadotropins and gonadotropin receptors, genetic loci associated with insulin sensitivity and susceptibility to obesity, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Dysregulation of genes involved in cell growth is suggested by the reports of upregulation of proto-oncogenic genes in endometrium and of telomere shortening in leukocytes. </p><p>Several important investigations utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes linked to PCOS, commencing with a series of studies conducted in large populations of ethnic Han Chinese in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The major findings in this population have been generally replicated in most other populations studied. Linkages for polymorphisms in the fibrillin 3, proopiomelanocortin, and diverse signaling pathway genes have been robust in many populations. How the various linkages are functionally related to PCOS is often unclear. Variations in fibrillin 3 have been proposed to dysregulate transforming growth factor beta (TGF&szlig;) signaling and account for ovarian stromal hyperplasia. Other findings support a role for epigenetic gene modifications in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The variety of pathways involved and lack of a common thread attests to the multifactorial nature and heterogeneity of the syndrome.

Experiments in several animal models demonstrate that congenital androgenization leads to PCOS features. Studies in the rhesus monkey exposed to androgen excess early in gestation have been particularly informative. These animals have characteristic features of PCOS, with ovarian and adrenal hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, polyfollicular ovaries, and elevated LH levels, with resistance to negative feedback inhibition of LH release by progesterone. They also have abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia. </p><p>Studies in a rat model indicate that prenatal androgen exposure suppresses the induction of hypothalamic progesterone receptors by estrogen; this effect persists into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>These observations demonstrate the potential for in utero exposures to influence epigenetic programming and postnatal development, although the relevance of the consequence of congenital virilization to ordinary PCOS has not been established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658348467\"><span class=\"h3\">Disturbed fetal nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is good evidence that fetal undernutrition predisposes to metabolic syndrome and related cardiovascular disease in adulthood; this association is sometimes termed &quot;metabolic programming.&quot; It has been proposed that low birth weight is likewise a risk factor for PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Two syndromes of intractable obesity in childhood that herald PCOS in adolescence are characterized by moderately severe insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia that exerts biologic effects (see <a href=\"#H2444724126\" class=\"local\">'Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism'</a> below): In pseudo-Cushing syndrome, insulin excess seems to account for the obesity; in pseudoacromegaly, insulin excess accounts for overgrowth.

An abnormal degree of insulin resistance, obesity, or luteinizing hormone (LH) excess are each found in about one-half of cases. Thus, the common denominator in PCOS appears to be ovarian hyperandrogenism, with insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism (hyperinsulinism) being a non-essential but common aggravating factor in the pathophysiology. LH excess and the propensity to obesity seem to be secondary to the underlying ovarian hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinism. </p><p>A unified minimal model of PCOS pathophysiology, which incorporates the major features of the syndrome into a unified scheme, is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH)</strong> &ndash; The model posits that the essence of PCOS is the FOH, which is found in the vast majority of cases.

In a small minority of individuals, modest hyperandrogenemia of extra-ovarian origin (adrenal or peripheral sources) causes anovulation and polycystic ovaries.

Paradoxically, this hyperinsulinemia exerts biologic effects because the insulin resistance is selective: the hyperinsulinemia affects the ovary because this tissue remains insulin-sensitive, despite insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver (see <a href=\"#H2444724126\" class=\"local\">'Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism'</a> below). In the ovary, hyperinsulinism upregulates androgen production in theca cells by sensitizing them to LH, and also prematurely luteinizes granulosa cells. These actions of insulin aggravate hyperandrogenism, the development of polycystic ovaries and anovulation (see <a href=\"#H2444724126\" class=\"local\">'Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism'</a> below). Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinemia also promotes adiposity, which in turn aggravates the insulin-resistant state.

The excessive circulating androgen acts on skin pilosebaceous units in the skin to cause the cutaneous manifestations of the syndrome, eg, hirsutism.

In addition, these patients have abnormal results of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> androgen suppression test (DAST) in that administration of dexamethasone fails to suppress serum testosterone normally in the presence of normal adrenocortical suppression.

Both are described below.

Cytochrome P450c17 has both 17-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activity, and the latter is the rate-limiting step in androgen formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Androgen production within the ovary is normally tightly regulated because androgen is a necessary evil in the ovary: androgen is required as the substrate for estrogen formation and androgen itself is required for optimal fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>]. However, excessive androgen disrupts ovarian follicular development. At the small antral follicle stage of development, LH stimulates ovarian theca cells to form androgen and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates granulosa cells to form estrogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57364\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57364 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normally, theca cell androgen production is coordinated with granulosa cell estrogen production by intraovarian mechanisms rather than by endocrine negative feedback loops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57364\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57364 \">figure 3</a>). Within the ovary, the response to LH is modulated by the balance between down-regulation and up-regulation processes. Down-regulation results in part from LH receptor-binding sites being desensitized by elevated LH levels (&quot;homologous desensitization&quot;). In part, androgen formation by P450c17 in response to LH is down-regulated by androgen and estrogen. Down-regulation is counterbalanced by granulosa cell factors that up-regulate P450c17 activities, particularly insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and inhibin. Insulin and inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta), also up-regulate P450c17 activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In PCOS, down-regulation of thecal androgen production is fundamentally flawed: PCOS ovaries are hyper-responsive to LH stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>]. Three lines of evidence suggest that the dysregulation of steroidogenesis in PCOS is fundamentally of intrinsic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. First, in vivo evidence has shown FOH to be typified by steroidogenic hypersensitivity to gonadotropins that persists after prolonged gonadotropin suppression, and there is a parallel adrenal steroidogenic defect, termed primary FAH, as discussed in the following sections. Second, in vitro studies have shown an abnormal steroidogenic theca cell phenotype to be present and to persist through long-term passage in cell culture, which suggests an intrinsic genetically-mediated defect. Third, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic linkage of PCOS to the DENND1A.V2 protein that reproduces the PCOS theca cell phenotype in vitro, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H1972857802\" class=\"local\">'Gene variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Granulosa cell dysfunction </strong>&mdash; Granulosa cells line the antrum of the ovarian follicle. They form estrogen and provide growth factors that regulate follicle and oocyte development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Androgen actions on granulosa cells are required for optimal follicle growth in response to gonadotropins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>]. Androgens normally stimulate the transformation of primordial follicles from dormancy into primary follicles (&quot;recruitment&quot;), which is the first step in their growth and development into small antral follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thecal androgen then normally synergizes with FSH to induce LH receptors on granulosa cells and permit their formation of progesterone in response to LH as the first steps in luteinizing the preovulatory follicle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In PCOS, excess intraovarian androgen causes the granulosa cell dysfunction that underlies anovulation and PCOM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Androgen excess stimulates an abnormally large number of small follicles to grow. It also contributes to the <strong>premature</strong> luteinization of the follicle, ie, granulosa cell luteinization in the mid-follicular phase, which seems to be the basis for the follicular maturation arrest that hinders the emergence of a dominant follicle and, thus, results in oligo-anovulation. The increased proliferation of small follicles and the maturation arrest at the large antral stage of follicle development that result from androgen excess are the basis of PCOM and anovulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>). Androgen stimulation of granulosa cell proliferation in early follicle development probably causes the increased production of anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone in PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, it is also possible that granulosa cell dysfunction in PCOS is a manifestation of an intrinsic defect in the intraovarian regulation of folliculogenesis. Thus, excessive FSH-dependent granulosa cell factors such as inhibin-B that are androgen-stimulatory may reflect intrinsic granulosa cell dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2444724126\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-half of PCOS subjects have an abnormal degree of insulin resistance, ie, insulin resistance is increased relative to the degree of obesity (body mass index [BMI]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,39,40</a>]. Thus, the insulin resistance of these women with PCOS is thought to be intrinsic. The other one-half of PCOS patients are no more insulin-resistant than otherwise healthy individuals with comparable BMIs. </p><p>The insulin resistance of PCOS is remarkable because resistance to insulin is tissue-selective for some metabolic effects of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While tissues such as skeletal muscle are resistant to insulin action on glucose metabolism, the compensatory hyperinsulinemia elicits excess insulin action in such tissues such as the ovary and fat. Signaling pathways remain sensitive to many growth factor-like, protein-anabolic, and lipogenic actions of insulin. These actions of insulin aggravate the steroidogenic dysregulation and contribute to the obesity and acanthosis nigricans that are common comorbidities of PCOS. Thus, PCOS presents the paradox of &quot;insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism,&quot; ie, a state of excessive insulin signaling in the presence of insulin resistance to the main glucose-metabolic effect of insulin.</p><p>Hyperinsulininism is unlikely to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of most cases of PCOS because it is an inconsistent and usually mild feature of the syndrome, particularly in the developmental (adolescent) phase of the syndrome. Furthermore, it does not account for the intrinsic theca cell dysfunction characteristic of PCOS. However, it plays a primary pathogenic role in those patients with severe or extreme insulin-resistance syndromes that are complicated by PCOS.</p><p>However, hyperinsulinism is an important aggravating factor in PCOS pathogenesis in about one-half of cases. In particular, it aggravates FOH: The hyperinsulinemia sensitizes the intrinsically dysregulated ovarian theca cells to secrete excess androgen in response to LH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>), step 2). It does this by reversing the LH-induced homologous desensitization of LH-binding sites, which up-regulates P450c17 activities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57364\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57364 \">figure 3</a>). Insulin also up-regulates testosterone formation by type 5 17&szlig;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase via a transcription factor that stimulates adipogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Insulin excess also synergizes with androgen excess and FSH to induce LH receptors on granulosa cells, contributing to premature luteinization of granulosa cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,42</a>]. This premature responsiveness to LH of granulosa cells aggravates their dysfunction. The severity of insulin resistance correlates with the severity of hyperandrogenism, the severity of anovulatory symptomatology, and the prevalence of PCOM. Any treatment that lowers insulin levels improves hyperandrogenism, though the hyperandrogenism of typical PCOS is seldom fully corrected by such treatments alone in most populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703072287\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated pathophysiologic disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess gonadotropin secretion, adiposity, and adrenal androgenic function are inconsistent features of PCOS that seem related to dysregulation of steroidogenesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H583113021\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonadotropin abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LH is necessary for the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Thus, PCOS is a gonadotropin-dependent, ie, functional, form of ovarian hyperandrogenism. Any treatment that suppresses LH levels (eg, estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives) suppresses ovarian hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Increased LH, often accompanied by decreased FSH, was the first laboratory abnormality identified in classic PCOS and was historically thought to play a role in its pathogenesis by increasing ovarian androgen production. Subsequent research showed that serum LH is elevated in only about one-half of PCOS patients with documented FOH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, the homologous desensitization phenomenon limits ovarian androgen excess in response to excess LH, except in the presence of insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism. </p><p>Evidence suggests that the increased LH observed in patients with PCOS is primarily caused by androgen interfering with sex-steroid negative feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Such data suggest that LH excess in PCOS is the result, rather than the cause, of androgen excess.</p><p>In more severe cases of PCOS, the moderate testosterone excess stimulates LH secretion ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>), step 3). Additionally, granulosa cells that have been prematurely luteinized, a process to which hyperinsulinism contributes (see <a href=\"#H2989656973\" class=\"local\">'Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism'</a> above), now secrete estrogen in response to LH as well as FSH. The negative feedback effect of the resultant estradiol excess can account for the significantly low FSH levels of PCOS ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>), step 4). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1647712375\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About one-half of PCOS patients are obese, and at least one-third of non-obese PCOS patients have increased intra-abdominal fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,45</a>]. </p><p>The reason for the high prevalence of obesity in PCOS is not entirely clear. The hyperinsulinism of insulin resistance seems to be an important factor since in vitro studies indicate that insulin signaling in human subcutaneous adipose tissue is intact in PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,46</a>]. Insulin signaling is of major importance to the size and function of the adipose tissue depot: it stimulates adipogenesis (development of preadipocytes into adipocytes) and lipogenesis, while inhibiting lipolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Adolescence is a critical period for establishment of the adipocyte population. Obesity may also arise to some extent from an intrinsic developmental defect in the adipocyte lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Obesity aggravates the clinical severity of FOH by increasing insulin resistance ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>), panel B).

In PCOS, visceral fat contributes more to insulin resistance than does abdominal fat because its lipolytic response to catecholamines (the major lipolytic stimulus in man) is uniquely enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The enhanced visceral fat lipolysis of PCOS appears to cause hepatic insulin resistance via the lipotoxicity of the excess free fatty acids released into the portal circulation. The nature of the independent relationship of visceral fat to muscle insulin resistance is unclear, but diacylglycerol and hepatic molecules such as fibroblast growth factor 19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] have been postulated to be mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The most common postnatal environmental contributor is obesity. (See <a href=\"#H2015727218\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of PCOS usually includes excess ovarian androgen production (functional ovarian hyperandrogenism [FOH]), with or without insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism or functional adrenal hyperandrogenism (FAH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94855 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'A unified concept of PCOS pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>FOH is present in most cases and typically arises from dysregulation of steroidogenesis that sensitizes ovarian steroidogenesis to luteinizing hormone (LH) ((<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111337 \">figure 1</a>), step 1).
