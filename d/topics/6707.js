These fractures of the distal humerus are frequently problematic in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Proper care requires appropriate assessment and prompt orthopedic care for those patients whose fractures pose the greatest risk for long-term complications.</p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation and treatment of supracondylar fractures in children.

They occur most frequently in children between 5 and 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Supracondylar fractures result from a fall on an outstretched arm in up to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The nondominant extremity is most commonly affected. Children under three years of age typically sustain a supracondylar fracture after a fall from a height of less than 3 feet (eg, fall from a bed or couch). Most fractures in older children result from higher falls from playground equipment (eg, monkey bars, swings) or other high energy mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, the supracondylar region encompasses an area of thin, weak bone located in the distal humerus. This region is bordered posteriorly by the olecranon fossa and anteriorly by the coronoid fossa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66099 \">figure 1</a>). The medial and lateral aspects of the supracondylar region extend distally to the developing medial and lateral condyles and epicondyles.</p><p>When a child falls onto an outstretched arm with the elbow in hyperextension, the force of the fall is transmitted through the olecranon to the weak supracondylar region, causing a supracondylar fracture. Depending on the severity of the fracture, posterior displacement of the distal fracture fragment and anterior displacement of the proximal fracture fragment may occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54389 \">figure 2</a>). The fracture line typically propagates transversely across the distal humerus through the center of the olecranon fossa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56874\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56874 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Supracondylar fracture classification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft tissue structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In more severe supracondylar fractures (especially type III), the proximal fragment of the distal fractured humerus is driven anteriorly into soft tissue structures with potential impingement on important blood vessels and nerves. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Supracondylar fracture classification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brachial artery is superficial to the brachialis muscle along the anteromedial aspect of the humerus. As the brachial artery passes anterior to the distal humerus, an extensive collateral circulation develops. As the artery extends into the forearm, it splits into the radial and ulnar artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>In patients with posterolateral displacement of a supracondylar fracture, the brachial artery may be injured when the proximal fragment of the fractured humerus moves medially, piercing the brachialis muscle and reaching the brachial artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72056 \">figure 4</a>). In addition, the brachial artery may be tethered to the sharp edge of the proximal fracture fragment by the supratrochlear branch of the anterior ulnar recurrent artery, thereby increasing the risk of brachial artery injury during movement of the injured arm or fracture manipulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57069\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57069 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>&quot;Scraping&quot; of the brachial artery by the bony fragment may result in intimal damage to the vessel. This injury may subsequently lead to thrombosis and vascular insufficiency. Because of the extensive collateral circulation present at the elbow, it is rare for ischemia of the arm to occur from complete brachial artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Median nerve injury often accompanies brachial artery impingement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following a displaced supracondylar fracture, the median (including the anterior interosseous nerve branch), radial, and ulnar nerves are at potential risk for injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 3</a>). Although nerve injuries may rarely be associated with long term sequelae, the majority are neurapraxias, such as temporary loss of nerve function (especially motor function) without anatomical nerve disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median nerve crosses the elbow joint with the brachial artery. Posterolateral distal fracture fragment displacement with medial movement of the proximal fracture fragment puts the median nerve and its anterior interosseous nerve branch at the greatest risk of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72056 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Median nerve injury results in weakness of the flexor muscles of the hand and loss of two-point sensation on the palmar surface of the thumb and the index and middle fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The anterior interosseous nerve (AION) is the branch of the median nerve most commonly injured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The AION lacks a superficial sensory component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Children and adolescents with AION syndrome initially have proximal forearm pain followed by weakness in the hand with no sensory deficits. On physical examination they have a weak &quot;OK&quot; sign <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a lack of distal interphalangeal flexion when making an &quot;OK&quot; sign (eg, more of a pincer grasp than an &quot;OK&quot; sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52203 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic deficit'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radial nerve runs between the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles before crossing the elbow and penetrating the supinator muscle. Posteromedial distal fracture fragment displacement increases the chance of radial nerve impingement because of lateral proximal fracture fragment displacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72056 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Injury to the radial nerve results in weakness of wrist extension, hand supination, and thumb extension. In addition, altered sensation is found in the dorsal web space between the thumb and index finger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ulnar nerve crosses the elbow posterior to the medial epicondyle and is typically not affected with extension type supracondylar fractures. However, it is prone to injury following flexion type supracondylar fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77891\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77891 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ulnar nerve injury causes weakness of wrist flexion and adduction, finger spread, and flexion of the distal phalanx of the fifth digit (pinky or little finger). These motor findings are accompanied by altered sensation of the ulnar side of the ring (fourth digit) and little fingers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, fractures of the distal humerus are most commonly due to a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) or direct trauma to the elbow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Extension and flexion are the two major types of supracondylar fracture and each has a characteristic mechanism of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p>Extension fractures account for approximately 95 percent of supracondylar fractures and typically result from a FOOSH mechanism with the elbow hyperextended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. The distal condylar complex may then shift in either the posterolateral or posteromedial direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72056 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Supracondylar flexion fractures account for 5 percent of supracondylar fractures. In contrast to extension injuries, these fractures result from a direct blow to the posterior aspect of the flexed elbow. In these cases, the distal condylar complex is more likely to displace in the anterolateral direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77891\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77891 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child with a supracondylar fracture typically has elbow pain, swelling, and very limited to no range of motion at the elbow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The clinician must rapidly assess the injury to identify degree of fracture displacement, neurovascular compromise, and evidence of compartment syndrome.</p><p>One approach is to initially inspect the affected arm and perform a brief neurovascular examination followed by a more complete evaluation once pain is controlled and radiographs have been obtained. The clinician should not encourage active or passive elbow movement in a patient with a suspected supracondylar fracture until a displaced fracture has been excluded by radiography. Patients with an obviously displaced supracondylar fracture require initial immobilization before radiography is performed. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Neurovascular examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia and immobilization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should carefully inspect the anterior and posterior arm for wounds that indicate an open fracture while limiting movement of the injured arm. In patients transferred by ambulance or from another hospital, this task often requires careful removal of previously applied immobilization devices. Open supracondylar fractures often manifest as a puncture wound or laceration in or just above the antecubital region.</p><p>Displaced fractures may have an &quot;S-shaped&quot; configuration or dimpling in the antecubital fossa associated with marked swelling about the elbow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60885 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56554 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p>Ecchymosis over the anteromedial aspect of the forearm suggests brachial artery injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Nondisplaced fractures may have minimal swelling, but observation will show that the child is not using the affected arm normally. Posterior distal humeral palpation is usually painful in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete neurovascular evaluation includes an assessment of radial and brachial pulses and the sensory and motor function of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F53902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53902 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with a normal initial neurovascular examination warrant regular repeated evaluation, especially immediately following splinting, fracture manipulation, or movement of the affected extremity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should compare the radial and brachial pulse with the opposite limb. Initially symmetric and equal pulses with normal perfusion and skin warmth are reassuring but do not entirely exclude vascular injury. However, patients who maintain normal pulse and perfusion over time are unlikely to have a brachial artery injury.</p><p>If a radial or brachial pulse is not palpable, a Doppler ultrasound should be used to determine the presence of distal perfusion. Pulse oximetry may also provide evidence of pulsatile flow as well as degree of oxygenation distal to the injury. If the pulse oximetry provides a wave form and oxygen saturation, then it can be used to provide continuous information on distal extremity perfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brisk capillary refill, normal color, and a warm hand indicate the presence of some distal perfusion, even when distal pulses are diminished or absent. Maintenance of perfusion despite abnormal pulses often arises from brachial artery spasm that typically resolves after urgent closed reduction and percutaneous pinning.</p><p>However, diminished or absent pulses in association with poor distal perfusion, pallor, and a cool hand are concerning signs of ischemia, especially in association with pain upon passive extension of the fingers. Patients with these findings warrant emergent intervention to reestablish limb perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It is more common in children with supracondylar fracture who also have a forearm fracture. Once the clinician suspects an acute compartment syndrome, compartment pressures must be measured to determine whether they are elevated, or a clinical decision to perform a fasciotomy is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forearm and wrist fractures occasionally complicate supracondylar fractures in children. Thus, the forearm and wrist warrant careful inspection for swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity and palpation for bony tenderness. Radiographs of these areas should be routinely ordered in children with supracondylar fractures. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic views'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, shoulder and clavicle injuries may occur and any deformity, swelling, or bony tenderness in these areas warrants radiographic investigation.</p><p>Most supracondylar fractures result from falls on an outstretched arm and are not associated with multiple trauma. However, children who fall from a height greater than three times their standing height or 10 feet, whichever is less, are at increased risk for multiple trauma to the head, thorax, and abdomen and may warrant, in addition to a complete physical examination, appropriate ancillary studies.

When obtaining radiographs in the child with a supracondylar fracture, the goal is to obtain the necessary films with minimal movement of the extremity. Excessive manipulation of the extremity during radiologic procedures may further exacerbate or precipitate neurovascular injury, especially in patients with an unstable type II or type III supracondylar fracture.</p><p>In patients with evidence of severe fracture (S-shape configuration or pucker sign, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60885 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56554 \">figure 8</a>)), splinting is advisable prior to obtaining radiographs. Alternatively, the clinician and an assistant may accompany the patient and assist with positioning of the obviously deformed extremity while ensuring neurovascular status does not deteriorate. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia and immobilization'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients without obvious deformity, a sling typically provides adequate support for nondisplaced fractures and allows for radiographs to be obtained more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic views</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic assessment of suspected supracondylar fracture requires a true lateral of the elbow with the humerus in anatomic position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71799\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71799 \">figure 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56647\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56647 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79906\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79906 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>Because of the association of supracondylar fractures with forearm fractures, the clinician should also obtain AP and lateral radiographic views of the forearm.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pertinent anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child with a supracondylar fracture typically has elbow pain, swelling, and very limited to no range of motion at the elbow. The clinician must rapidly assess the injury to identify neurovascular compromise, evidence of compartment syndrome, and degree of fracture displacement. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate analgesia should be provided BEFORE extremity radiographs are obtained. Radiographic assessment of suspected supracondylar fracture requires a true lateral of the elbow, if permitted by the patient's clinical condition, with the humerus in anatomic position and an anteroposterior (AP) projection of the distal humerus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51211 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79906\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79906 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71799\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71799 \">figure 11</a>). Because of the association of supracondylar fractures with forearm fractures, the clinician should also obtain AP and lateral radiographic views of the forearm. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-anatomy-and-radiographic-diagnosis-of-elbow-fracture-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elbow anatomy and radiographic diagnosis of elbow fracture in children&quot;, section on 'Plain radiograph interpretation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with evidence of deformity or severe fracture (eg, S-shape configuration or pucker sign, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60885 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56554 \">figure 8</a>)), splinting is advisable prior to obtaining radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-anatomy-and-radiographic-diagnosis-of-elbow-fracture-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elbow anatomy and radiographic diagnosis of elbow fracture in children&quot;, section on 'Plain radiograph interpretation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The emergency clinician should promptly identify children with vascular insufficiency and emergently involve an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise. Rarely, these children will require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68664\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68664 \">figure 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients who display a cold, cyanotic hand despite reduction attempts require emergent operative exploration and vascular repair. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulse'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Perfusion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Absent pulse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected compartment syndrome should prompt measurement of compartment pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emergent consultation with an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Once confirmed by compartment pressure measurement, immediate management of suspected acute compartment syndrome includes relieving all external pressure on the compartment. Definitive treatment consists of fasciotomy to decompress all involved compartments. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Compartment syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Measurement of compartment pressures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with adequate distal circulation and no sign of compartment syndrome, initial therapy consists of pain management and immobilization to prevent further displacement of the fracture. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia and immobilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergent orthopedic consultation is indicated for children with an open fracture, neurovascular compromise, or acute compartment syndrome. In addition, prompt involvement of an orthopedic surgeon is necessary for operative care of a child with a Type II or Type III supracondylar fracture. Nondisplaced Type I supracondylar fractures are treated with a long arm splint with orthopedic follow up in one week. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Supracondylar fracture classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic deficit'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Type I fracture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Type II fracture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Type III fracture'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Bachman D, Santora S.
