Due to the complexity and long-term nature of HF regimens, the need for careful diet and weight management, and the importance of intervention in the early phases of decompensation, patient self-management is crucial in avoiding hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Unfortunately, many patients lack self-care skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review evidence for the value of self-management and strategies for educating patients about self-management of HF. The medical management of HF and treatment for acute decompensation are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure in acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>). Strategies for avoiding hospitalization are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599895\"><span class=\"h1\">MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 6.5 million Americans are living with HF, and prevalence is expected to rise 46 percent by 2030 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The lifetime risk of HF from age 45 to 95 is between 20 and 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Every year, there are over one million hospitalizations for HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], with an incidence of 11.6 hospitalizations per 1000 for people aged 55 years or over, making HF among the leading causes of hospitalization in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Furthermore, in 2014, 21.4 percent of patients over age 64 who were hospitalized with HF were readmitted within 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Chronic HF care requires patients to follow complex medical regimens, comply with diet and exercise recommendations, actively engage with clinicians, and modify medications and behavior according to symptoms. This &quot;self-care&quot; is quite complex. Standard HF medical regimens often include at minimum three distinct classes of medications, some of which may be taken multiple times a day. In addition, patients are expected to restrict salt intake, monitor their weight daily, be able to identify early warning signs of deterioration, and adjust diuretic use according to clinical changes. Patients and caregivers may find these activities difficult to perform without education and support.</p><p>The consequences of inadequate self-care are profound. Inability to manage medications or diet may account for as many as one in five admissions for HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Conversely, improved self-management skills may reduce the odds of readmission at one year by 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, assisting patients to manage their own care is an essential component of chronic HF management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599902\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFIT OF SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies of self-management intervention in patients with HF have been multifaceted disease-management interventions that included interventions in addition to self-management education and promotion. Consequently, it is difficult to distinguish effects of self-management from other components of these complex interventions. They are also context dependent, and it is not clear how generalizable they are.</p><p>Some studies have focused exclusively on improving self-care, but these also may not be generalizable. The Quality HF-Diabetes randomized controlled trial was designed to improve self-care in patients with both HF and diabetes. This trial demonstrated improved overall quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and fewer hospitalization days, and was cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, only 134 subjects were enrolled (70 in the intervention arm) out of 741 screened, raising concerns about the generalizability of the intervention to the broader population. The MITI-HF randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing among 67 patients demonstrated no significant effect on perceived self-care maintenance and confidence in the main analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, a different randomized nurse-delivered self-care intervention among 86 patients demonstrated improved medication adherence among intervention patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A later randomized trial of a telephone-based coping skills training program involving 180 patients with HF showed improvement in quality of life metrics but not hospitalization or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In general, trials of long-term self-care education with frequent reinforcement have produced significant decreases in hospitalizations but no reduction in mortality. Longer duration interventions are more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The results on hospitalization outcomes of some of the larger trials and meta-analyses of smaller trials of self-management and other disease management strategies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599930\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT CONSTITUTES APPROPRIATE SELF-CARE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-care for HF encompasses a spectrum of behaviors ranging from adherence to medication, exercise, and diet recommendations (self-care maintenance) to recognition of early warning signs, and self-adjustment of the home-care regimen (self-care management). Two tools to assess patients' self-care abilities have been validated: the Self Care of Heart Failure Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (available in multiple languages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, at present, neither is commonly used outside the research setting. While a variety of patient-level factors are associated with self-care behavior performance, the strongest evidence exists for depression, which impedes self-care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>For patients with HF, the chief components of self-care programs are medication management, daily monitoring for <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms,</span> and adherence to a low sodium diet and routine exercise. These are discussed in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599937\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trial data show that treatment with beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>], angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiotensin II receptor blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] reduces hospitalization and mortality rates in patients with HF. In addition, one randomized controlled trial supports the use of angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors to reduce hospitalization and mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, for medications to be effective for prolonged periods outside the clinical trial setting, patients must have adequate medication-management skills. For example, in a randomized trial of 314 low-income patients with HF, half of whom were given intensive education by a pharmacist about medication management, the intervention group had higher adherence (78.8 percent) than the control group (67.9 percent) and subsequently required fewer emergency and hospital visits (incidence rate ratio 0.82, CI 0.73-0.93). Consequently, medication management is considered to be a cardinal self-care behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Self-care for medication management includes a wide variety of skills and practices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining initial and refill prescriptions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incorporating medication administration into the daily routine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhering to the daily medication schedule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding and implementing prescription changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognizing common side effects of medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing changes of routine such as travel or acute illness</p><p/><p>Self-care programs teach each of these skills, utilizing written, oral, graphic, video, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electronic tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. An example of a medication-maintenance schedule geared for low-literacy patients is the discharge instruction packet developed at Boston University [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other graphic aids to improve medication adherence have been developed at Emory University [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], University of California, Los Angeles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and elsewhere. A medication-management tool to help low-literacy patients adjust medications based on weight has been developed at the University of North Carolina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73970 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Mobile health (mHealth or m-health) technology applications to support medication adherence have exploded in number, although only a handful of studies have been conducted of efficacy among cardiovascular patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; these studies generally show modest benefit. Automated pill dispensing systems are now widely available (eg, ePill). Finally, companies have developed at least two dozen &quot;smart&quot; pill containers to remind patients to take medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inform clinicians about low adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Overall, few comparative effectiveness trials have been conducted of any of these new technological assistance devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. One four-arm randomized feasibility study of 60 patients with HF compared an electronic pillbox or a smartphone-based mHealth application with active reminders enabled with those without active reminders; there was no difference in adherence between the four arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], although there were only 15 patients in each arm. In fact, a large meta-analysis of all types of medication adherence interventions, involving 771 trials, found that interventions delivered via text message (28 trials) had similar effect sizes as those that did not, while computer-based interventions (14 trials) had significantly smaller effect sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Interventions conducted face-to-face were the most effective. In fact, of the eight trials that were restricted to patients with HF, five improved medication adherence, none of which included technological devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599953\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient medication instructions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To take each medication each day at the times indicated by using a system (list, pill box, etc.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not to allow prescriptions to expire or bottles to become empty before refilling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To use the same pharmacy each time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To ask the pharmacy to synchronize refills, enabling medication refills all to be requested at the same time of the month</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not to skip doses, even when they are feeling well</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To bring all their medications to each doctor&rsquo;s visit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To contact their doctor immediately if they feel they are having side effects from medications, rather than stopping them without telling anyone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To discuss barriers to obtaining medications (such as cost difficulties) with the physician</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599961\"><span class=\"h3\">Instructions for patients able to perform medication management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which pill is their diuretic</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to change the dose of the diuretic according to the HF action plan</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To carry out any additional changes that should accompany diuretic dose changes (ie, need for earlier refills, addition of potassium supplementation)</p><p/><p>Patients who have been properly instructed to perform medication management should be able to demonstrate the ability to carry out these activities. A useful tool kit for clinicians seeking to improve medication adherence among their patients has been developed by the New York City Health Department and is freely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599971\"><span class=\"h2\">Daily monitoring of signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain signs and symptoms often precede the need for further changes in clinical status that ultimately require hospitalization. For example, in a nested case-control study of 134 patients hospitalized for HF exacerbation and 134 similar patients who were not hospitalized, the relative odds ratio of hospitalization was 2.8 (95% CI 1.1-6.8) for a weight gain of &gt;2 to 5 pounds versus 2 pounds or fewer in one week. For patients who gained &gt;5 to 10 pounds in a week, the odds of hospitalization were 4.5 times those who gained 2 pounds or fewer (95% CI 1.5-13.8), and for those who gained more than 10 pounds, the relative odds were 7.6 (95% CI 2.2-26.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Consequently, early identification of worsening clinical status through symptom monitoring may be helpful in avoiding hospitalization. Of note, studies about exactly how this ought to be done, and the magnitude of the expected effect, are still lacking. Similar to medication management, symptom monitoring is an area that is seeing substantial growth in mHealth applications intended to support self-care, though again there is little to no high quality evidence that these new technologies are effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Self-care programs typically include the following suggestions for monitoring of signs and symptoms:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599979\"><span class=\"h3\">Daily weights</span></p><p>Patients should be instructed to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a scale with large enough print to be readily visible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a scale that is big enough for the patient to stand on easily</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a scale that is easy to &quot;zero,&quot; such as a digital scale</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weigh themselves at the same time every morning </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After urinating but before eating or drinking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Before getting dressed or in the same amount of clothing each day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Record the results in a log book or other permanent record</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compare results with previous day and with previous week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know their target weight</p><p/><p>A reasonable plan might be that for a two- to five-pound weight gain in one week, <span class=\"nowrap\">diet/medication</span> changes should be made as outlined in HF action plan; &gt;5 pound weight gain in one week requires immediate call to the designated physician or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599987\"><span class=\"h3\">Daily check for edema</span></p><p>Patients should be instructed to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examine their legs each day for swelling or an increase in existing swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Describe how far up the leg the swelling reaches (ankle, shin, knee)</p><p/><p>Worsening edema requires <span class=\"nowrap\">diet/medication</span> changes as outlined on the HF action plan; severe swelling requires immediate call to the designated physician or nurse. It is not necessary to teach patients the classic edema scale (1+ to 4+ pitting), as even clinicians are unreliable in assigning scores to edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Measuring ankle circumference with a soft tape measure is a more reliable objective measure that is easy to teach patients if a quantitative measure is desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, there are no data to show this is more effective than a subjective assessment of &quot;worsening.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6599995\"><span class=\"h3\">Daily check of symptom severity</span></p><p>Patients should perform the following checks daily:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor their exercise tolerance (eg, using a scale ranging from no shortness of breath, shortness of breath after moderate exertion, shortness of breath after mild exertion, shortness of breath at rest)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor their breathing at night (eg, using a scale ranging from no shortness of breath lying flat, needing two pillows or more, sleeping upright or awakening with sudden shortness of breath)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch for dizziness or lightheadedness (eg, using a scale ranging from not dizzy, dizzy for a while after standing, near <span class=\"nowrap\">syncope/syncope</span> or fall)</p><p/><p>For each of these symptoms, patients should be instructed that the less-severe symptoms would require <span class=\"nowrap\">diet/medication</span> modification as outlined in the HF action plan and the more severe symptoms would require an immediate call to the physician&rsquo;s office. (See <a href=\"#H6600128\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure action plan'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6600002\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence to sodium restricted diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sodium restriction can reduce blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive individuals and can enhance the response to antihypertensive drugs, except possibly calcium channel blockers. Sodium restriction may also diminish the potassium wasting in patients treated with diuretics and have other cardiovascular benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension#H1509939731\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salt intake, salt restriction, and primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Effect of sodium on blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p>There are no clinical trials demonstrating a benefit of a low-sodium (2 g) diet in HF. However, in prospective observational studies, outpatients with moderate-severe HF (NYHA class III or IV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) ingesting &gt;3 g sodium daily have substantially shorter times to hospitalization or death than those ingesting 2 to 3 g daily, with HRs of 2 to 2.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. On the other hand, low sodium diets may be harmful, particularly for patients with less severe disease. A study of a low-sodium (2 g) diet compared with a 3 g sodium diet in patients also on high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, and 1 L fluid restriction found harm from the low-sodium diet: 7.6 percent readmission rate after 180 days on 3 g sodium diet versus 26.3 percent on 2 g sodium diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although this study has been criticized for its unusually high dose of furosemide (250 to 500 mg twice daily) that was not altered even on the low-sodium diet, similar findings have been reported in observational data in patients with mild-moderate disease.

Nonetheless, it is clear that patients do not typically engage in adequate self-care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20636823\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Published nonadherence rates to HF medications range from 2 to 90 percent due to inconsistent and subjective assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The largest studies of HF medication adherence, which used reliable prescription refill data, show that on average patients have an adequate supply of a given medication at home 60 to 88 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. Given the relatively short half-life of HF medications and the necessity for persistent adrenergic blocking, however, very high adherence rates are now thought to be necessary to achieve a clinically-significant reduction in adverse outcomes. One observational study found that 88 percent adherence or better was necessary for improved event-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, observational studies of adherence may be confounded by healthy adherer effects, in which adherers do better even if they are taking placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The longer the duration of therapy, the lower the adherence rate in terms of on-time refills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Clinicians often fail to recognize when patients are not adhering to medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20636830\"><span class=\"h2\">Daily weights</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Published adherence to daily weight measurement in randomized trials ranges from 20 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

In addition to lack of knowledge, skills or commitment, as outlined above, there are a variety of other barriers to self-care. These include socioeconomic factors, patient factors, treatment factors, and health care system factors. Clinicians must be aware of these impediments to self-care in order to maximize their patients&rsquo; ability to manage their disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence to lipid-altering medications and recommended lifestyle changes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient adherence and the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20637574\"><span class=\"h2\">Socioeconomic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help reduce the impact of socioeconomic factors, clinicians should be aware of the costs of common medications, ask patients whether they can afford their medications, reduce the cost of medications (if possible), and make efforts to reduce the financial burden of self-care activities on their patients.</p><p>Medication cost is a significant barrier to adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Clinicians can help patients maintain adherence to medications by being sensitive to cost. The three classes of medications most commonly recommended for HF patients are all available in generic form; several in each class are also deeply discounted at major retailers. Commonly-associated medications such as statins are also available at these discounted rates. </p><p>Financial barriers also play a role in behavioral change. Examples include lack of insurance coverage for pharmaceutical smoking-cessation aids; the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables compared with the low cost of sodium- and cholesterol-rich foods; and the inability of many patients to afford formal exercise programs or gym memberships. Many patients do not even own a scale.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20637581\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy-related factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To overcome therapy-related barriers, clinicians should specifically query and counsel patients about common adverse effects of HF medications, ensure patients understand the potential benefits they can expect from their medications, maximize once daily formulations, and attempt to minimize pill quantity.</p><p>Side effects of medications are a major reason for noncompliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This has traditionally been considered particularly problematic for HF because both beta blockers and diuretics have been perceived to have high rates of side effects that patients may be reluctant to discuss, including impotence, mood dysfunction, and incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, an analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials involving over 25,000 patients suggests that beta blocker therapy was not associated with a significant absolute annual increase in risk of reported depressive symptoms (6 per 1000 patients; 95% CI -7 to 19). Beta blocker treatment was associated with small increases in fatigue (18 per 1000 patients; 95% CI 5-30) and sexual dysfunction (5 per 1000 patients; 95% CI 2-8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>It may, therefore, be helpful for clinicians to specifically counsel patients about the low likelihood of these effects. Likewise, it may help to counsel patients that frequent urination is a sign that medications are working, and that the volume of urination is likely to level off once a stable state has been reached.</p><p>More frequently dosed medications are less likely to be taken consistently; these formulations should be avoided whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

To address patient factors, clinicians should screen patients for depression, cognition, and low health literacy, and should tailor treatment regimens for individuals with multiple morbidities, in addition to promoting appropriate knowledge, skills, and patient engagement as described above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20637595\"><span class=\"h3\">Low health literacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and a 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] defined health literacy as follows: &quot;The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.&quot; Reading literacy is not synonymous with health literacy. For instance, while 71 percent of low-literacy patients in one study could read, &quot;Take two tablets by mouth twice daily,&quot; only 35 percent could correctly identify how many pills a day they would take [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>The impact of low health literacy on HF outcomes is illustrated by a retrospective study of 1547 patients with HF median of 1.2 years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Low health literacy was independently associated with higher mortality (unadjusted rate 17.6 versus 6.3 percent; adjusted HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.3-2.97]) but not hospitalization (unadjusted rate, 30.5 versus 23.2 percent; adjusted HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.8-1.37). </p><p>Low health literacy is a key component of adherence to behavioral changes as well as to medications: For example, the ability to recognize changes in weights and then appropriately self-adjust diuretic dose or call the physician requires substantial health literacy. However, when self-care education is appropriately targeted to health literacy level, patients with low health literacy can achieve the same benefit from self-care as those with high health literacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>A 2010 consensus statement from the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) proposed five steps for health care providers to address low health literacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1: Recognize that health literacy is real and may compromise patient care. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2: Identify patients at risk for low health literacy. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3: Formally screen patients who are at risk: Several health literacy measurement tools exist to rapidly screen patients for low health literacy in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 4: Document health literacy levels and learning preferences in patient records. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 5: Integrate strategies to facilitate to facilitate health understanding. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20637602\"><span class=\"h3\">Multimorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with multiple chronic illnesses face additional physical, cognitive, and functional challenges to effective self-care. Approximately one-quarter to one-half of patients with HF have cognitive impairment, and geriatric conditions are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Patients with cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>], in particular, may have difficulty conducting self-care activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Moreover, these patients are more likely to have multiple clinicians and receive confusing or conflicting recommendations. The average Medicare patient with HF sees 15 providers a year. Patients with HF have larger and more complex therapeutic, self-monitoring, and behavioral requirements. The presence of one condition may complicate treatment for others, as, for instance, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in a patient with coronary artery disease, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and HF (for which the risks and benefits of aspirin are uncertain) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-should-be-avoided-or-used-with-caution-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that should be avoided or used with caution in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a>).

Clinicians and educators can increase patient involvement in and engagement with their care in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using motivational interviewing techniques (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862274\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Questioning patients explicitly about their beliefs in disease etiology and efficacy of treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Questioning patients explicitly about their life goals and tying self-care regimens to the achievement of these goals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Engaging patients in developing a plan, and in filling out a notebook or monitoring materials</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using brainstorming with patients to help them incorporate self-management into their lives: build on patients&rsquo; own experience and routines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helping patients identify one or two concrete actions they can do for each aspect of self-care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having patients describe their self-management practices and offering feedback to improve them, rather than suggesting or imposing self-management practices</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6600128\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE ACTION PLAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major components of HF self-care can be summarized in terms of a HF action plan. A HF action plan is divided into green, yellow, orange, and red zones corresponding to a stable state, worsening status, acute exacerbation, and cardiac emergency. The action plan includes a customized response plan for each state that is developed by the clinician in tandem with the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72459 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75501 \">figure 4</a>). For most patients, symptoms in the yellow zone would require additional diuretic intake and renewed vigilance to diet and medication compliance. Symptoms in the orange zone should prompt an immediate call to the physician and rapid evaluation. Symptoms in the red zone should prompt a call for an ambulance. All patients should receive an HF action plan customized to their condition and abilities for self-care.</p><p>The 2010 Heart Failure Society of America guidelines recommend that patients have an HF action plan as a component of education and counseling focusing on self-care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-self-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2762560688\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
