Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that causes patches of thick, inflamed red skin that are often covered with silvery scales.</p><p>Psoriatic arthritis affects men and women equally. Most people who develop psoriatic arthritis have skin symptoms of psoriasis first, followed by arthritis symptoms. However, in about 15 percent of cases, symptoms of arthritis are noticed before psoriasis appears. In another 15 percent of cases, psoriatic arthritis is diagnosed at the same time as psoriasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers have not identified the exact cause of psoriatic arthritis. However, they believe that the disease develops due to a combination of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 40 percent of people with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis have family members with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. This means that a close relative of a patient with psoriatic arthritis is about 50 times more likely to develop the disease than an unrelated person. If an identical twin has psoriatic arthritis, the other twin is very likely to have or to develop the condition.</p><p>Genetic researchers have identified areas on certain chromosomes that may increase the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. Other genetic factors may contribute to the severity of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of immune system abnormalities have been noted in people with psoriatic arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to certain infections may also contribute to the development of psoriatic arthritis. Some experts believe there is a link between streptococcal infection and the development of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, although the link has not been proven. Psoriatic arthritis also occurs more commonly in people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in the general population.</p><p>Psoriasis frequently appears at sites where there is skin trauma. This is called the Koebner phenomenon. Some patients develop arthritis in an injured joint. Indeed, physical trauma has been identified as a risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis among patients with psoriasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and tenderness in the joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69282 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty moving or stiffness in the joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the back. About half of all patients have morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin patches (also called plaques) that are dry or red, usually covered with silvery-white scales, which may have raised edges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74211 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail abnormalities, such as pitted, discolored, or crumbly nails (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71998 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Some people with psoriatic arthritis have more difficulty with stiffness and immobility than with joint pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of psoriatic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis tends to affect certain groups of joints. The following terms are used to describe patterns of psoriatic arthritis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal arthritis &ndash; This type of psoriatic arthritis affects the end joints of the fingers and toes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric oligoarthritis &ndash; This type of psoriatic arthritis affects fewer than five small or large joints in the body but does not necessarily occur on both sides of the body. (For example, a person might experience joint pain in one elbow but not the other.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric polyarthritis &ndash; This type of psoriatic arthritis affects five or more joints on both sides of the body (ie, the right and left knee). It produces symptoms similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis mutilans &ndash; This type of psoriatic arthritis deforms and destroys the joints, and it is often accompanied by a shortening of the affected fingers or toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64253\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64253 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spondyloarthritis &ndash; This type of psoriatic arthritis affects the joints of the spine.</p><p/><p>Polyarthritis is the most common type of psoriatic arthritis, followed by oligoarthritis. Less than 20 percent of patients experience distal arthritis alone, but those who do may also have spondyloarthritis. Arthritis mutilans, the deforming type of arthritis, can occur along with any other pattern of arthritis, but is less common.</p><p>The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), an international collection of experts on these conditions, has defined psoriatic arthritis as having six domains: peripheral arthritis (joints of the hands, feet, arms, and legs), axial disease (back and neck), enthesitis (inflammation at the points where tendons and ligaments attach to bone), dactylitis (inflammation of the whole digit, eg, finger or toe), skin psoriasis, and nail psoriasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the joint pain and stiffness that psoriatic arthritis causes, there may also be swelling in the areas where tendons attach to bones, a condition called enthesitis. Sites that are commonly involved include the Achilles tendon attachment to the back of the heel, the attachment of plantar fascia (the tendon in the sole of the foot) to the heel, and the area that tendons attach to the pelvic bones. Another condition, tenosynovitis, can occur when the sheaths surrounding certain tendons, especially those in the hands and arms, become swollen and inflamed.</p><p>Almost half of people with psoriatic arthritis also experience dactylitis, which causes an entire finger or toe to swell (sometimes called sausage finger or toe). Dactylitis may be associated with progressive joint damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67123 \">picture 5</a>). People with psoriatic arthritis sometimes develop swelling of the hands and feet that is not limited to the joints. This swelling may occur before any joint symptoms of psoriatic arthritis are noted.</p><p>Eighty to 90 percent of people with psoriatic arthritis have nail problems. They may develop pitted nails, which look as if someone has taken a pin and pricked the nail several times, or there may be early separation of the nail from the nail bed. The severity of a person's nail problems is often similar to the severity of the skin and joint problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71998 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>In some cases, people with psoriatic arthritis also experience eye problems. Inflammation of the structures of the eye can cause eye pain and redness and is referred to as uveitis or iritis.</p><p>Like patients with psoriasis, patients with psoriatic arthritis may be at increased risk of heart disease or stroke; certain medicines and lifestyle changes might help decrease this risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers diagnose psoriatic arthritis by obtaining the medical history, performing a physical examination, and taking x-rays of the joints to check for inflammation and joint damage. Blood tests or joint fluid tests may be done to rule out other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.</p><p>In some cases, a magnetic resonance imaging test (MRI) may be used to detect joint and soft-tissue inflammation that cannot be seen on x-rays. Because psoriatic arthritis may be associated with a loss in bone mineral density, tests may also be used to determine if you are at risk for osteoporosis or have an increased risk of bone fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Psoriatic arthritis may be confused with other forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and, occasionally, osteoarthritis. However, the skin lesions, nail problems, and specific patterns of inflammation observed in psoriatic arthritis allow clinicians to differentiate it from other forms of inflammatory arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PSORIASIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic skin disease may be treated with topical applications (creams or lotions) or phototherapy. Skin problems that are resistant to topical therapy may require the use of oral treatments (pills). Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis may require treatment with biologic agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although effective in controlling the skin symptoms in most patients, none of these treatments work in all patients. Moreover, none can cure psoriasis; most patients have a flare of symptoms if treatment is discontinued. Thus, prolonged therapy is generally required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis treatment can help to relieve joint pain and stiffness, as well as the other symptoms of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lifestyle changes can help; many different medications are available as well. Some of the most common approaches are discussed below; your doctor will work with you to figure out the right medication(s) and plan for you based on your symptoms, severity of disease, and preferences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498499\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, weight loss can help. Up to 40 percent of psoriatic arthritis patients are obese. Several studies have demonstrated that weight loss can improve response to medical treatments for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.</p><p>Weight loss of 10 percent or more of body weight in obese patients can dramatically improve response to treatments. The type of diet is not as important as the weight loss, but you should talk with your doctor about the most appropriate approach to weight loss for you. A combination of exercise and weight loss may also lessen the chance of developing diabetes and improve cardiovascular health in people with psoriatic arthritis.</p><p>Treatments such as heat, exercise, and physical therapy may also help to relieve the pain and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis. A separate article discusses exercise and arthritis. In particular, interval training was shown to substantially decrease fatigue in patients with psoriatic arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to control inflammation and to relieve the pain of psoriatic arthritis. NSAIDs must be taken continuously and at a sufficient dose to have an antiinflammatory effect.</p><p>NSAIDs must usually be taken for several weeks before their full degree of effectiveness as an antiinflammatory is known. If the initial dose of an NSAID does not improve symptoms, your doctor may recommend increasing the dose gradually or switching to another NSAID.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonselective NSAIDs include over-the-counter drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, and a number of prescription-strength NSAIDs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective NSAIDs (also called cyclooxygenase [COX]-2 inhibitors) are as effective as nonselective NSAIDs and are less likely to cause gastrointestinal injury and side effects. Celecoxib (brand name: Celebrex) is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the United States.</p><p/><p>Detailed information about NSAIDs is available in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids, also called steroids, can suppress inflammation and can relieve pain when injected into affected joints. Oral glucocorticoids are not usually recommended for people with psoriatic arthritis because they may cause a severe form of skin psoriasis.</p><p>Joint injections have few side effects, but some people experience a brief flare of pain after an injection. There is also a very small risk of joint infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methotrexate (MTX) is a &quot;conventional,&quot; &quot;nonbiologic&quot; disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). It reduces excessive production of skin cells and may also suppress the immune system. It is often recommended for people with multiple swollen joints caused by psoriatic arthritis, although evidence of its effectiveness is limited. Some people need to take a medication other than methotrexate because their condition affects the sacroiliac joints (the joints that connect the bottom of the spine to the pelvis) or spine, or because their skin disease does not respond adequately to MTX.</p><p>MTX is usually taken once per week as pills or by injection. Treatment with higher doses may require that it be injected under the skin, which may be done by a patient or family member.</p><p>Taking folic acid or folinic acid can reduce the risk of certain methotrexate side effects, including risk of liver problems related to methotrexate. Patients who use methotrexate should not drink alcohol. The most serious potential side effects of methotrexate include liver toxicity, lung disease, and bone marrow suppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684316148\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternatives to methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are unable to take methotrexate, or if it does not work well enough to relieve your symptoms, your doctor might suggest another medication. Options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leflunomide</strong> &ndash; Leflunomide (sample brand name: Arava) is a DMARD that can improve both skin and joint disease symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Possible side effects include diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes, and only about 40 percent of people with psoriatic arthritis benefit from this treatment. Experts may recommend leflunomide if you have not adequately responded to or have had side effects with methotrexate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sulfasalazine</strong> &ndash; Sulfasalazine (sulphasalazine, salazopyrin) is a DMARD that may be effective for the joint pain and skin lesions associated with psoriatic arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, not all patients benefit from sulfasalazine, and many patients cannot tolerate it due to gastrointestinal side effects. Patients who are allergic to sulfa drugs should not use sulfasalazine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-the-5-aminosalicylates-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sulfasalazine and the 5-aminosalicylates (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyclosporine</strong> &ndash; Cyclosporine is a drug that suppresses the immune system and is also used to treat severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It was used more in the past, before the availability of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, but still may be helpful for some people with psoriatic arthritis. It may take three to four months before a response is seen. Adding cyclosporine to methotrexate may be more effective than either treatment alone. Side effects of cyclosporine can include reduced kidney function and high blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Apremilast</strong> &ndash; Apremilast (brand name: Otezla) is a medication for psoriatic arthritis that comes in pill form. People taking apremilast should have their weight monitored regularly because the medication can cause significant weight loss. Use of apremilast has also been associated with an increase in reports of depression compared with placebo, but it does not cause significant laboratory abnormalities. This medication has not been demonstrated to inhibit joint damage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TNF-alpha inhibitors are among the group of drugs called &quot;biologics,&quot; &quot;biologic DMARDs,&quot; or &quot;biologic response modifiers.&quot; These drugs interfere with inflammation and the immune response; they may be used if methotrexate (or another nonbiologic DMARD) is ineffective, or as first-line therapy in people whose psoriatic arthritis is severe and interferes with their ability to function, and in those with arthritis affecting the sacroiliac joint or spine. Drugs in this class include proteins that interfere with the actions of TNF, such as etanercept (brand name: Enbrel), adalimumab (brand name: Humira), infliximab (brand name: Remicade), golimumab (brand name: Simponi), and certolizumab pegol (brand name: Cimzia).</p><p>Biologic agents, such as the TNF inhibitors, usually work rapidly, often within two weeks, although they may take three months to be effective. They may be used alone or in combination with other DMARDs, NSAIDs, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoid injections. Because of their very high cost, they are often reserved for people who have not responded fully to DMARDs or who cannot tolerate DMARDs in doses large enough to control psoriatic arthritis symptoms.</p><p>All biologic agents must be either injected or given intravenously, depending on the medication. Humira, Enbrel, and Cimzia are injected under the skin by the patient, a family member, or a nurse. Intravenous infusion is necessary for Remicade; this is typically done in a doctor's office or an outpatient infusion center and takes one to three hours to complete. Simponi may be given either by injection of by an intravenous infusion (IV).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521437599\"><span class=\"h2\">Other biologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with severe disease may be treated with other &quot;biologics&quot; instead of TNF inhibitors. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ustekinumab</strong> &ndash; A medication called ustekinumab (brand name: Stelara) is sometimes used in people who do not get better with the options listed above. This medication interferes with inflammation by blocking not TNF but another set of proteins involved in the immune response called interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23. It may be used in patients who do not tolerate or have been unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. It has been shown to slow joint damage. It is injected under the skin by the patient, a family member, or a nurse. Like the TNF inhibitors, this drug increases the risk of infections and might increase the risk of cancer. Ustekinumab may not be effective for back and spinal involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secukinumab and ixekizumab</strong> &ndash; Secukinumab (brand name: Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (brand name: Taltz) are medications which, like ustekinumab, may provide alternatives to TNF inhibitors in some cases. They affect the immune response by interfering with a protein called IL-17. Both are given as an injection under the skin. They increase the risk of infections and might increase the risk of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abatacept</strong> &ndash; Abatacept (brand name: Orencia) is a medication used for treating rheumatoid arthritis that may also have benefit in treating psoriatic arthritis. It may be an option in situations where other drugs have been ineffective or cannot be used. This agent is modestly effective for peripheral joint pain and swelling. It has not been particularly effective for psoriasis and the ability to limit X-ray damage has not been studied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tofacitinib</strong> &ndash; Tofacitinib (brand name: Xeljanz) is another oral medication that is available for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. It works well for the joints but not as well for the skin as some of the other medications. It was already being used for several years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis when its use was first approved for psoriatic arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis, a disorder that causes inflammation and thickening of the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Researchers have not identified the exact cause of psoriatic arthritis.
