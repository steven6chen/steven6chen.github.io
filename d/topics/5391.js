Uterine sarcoma is rare (3 to <span class=\"nowrap\">7/100,000</span> in the United States population) and has a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both present as focal masses in the uterine myometrium. Thus, clinicians who evaluate and manage women with presumed leiomyomas are presented with a clinical challenge: how to assess if one of the many women diagnosed with this common condition actually has a rare type of malignancy while avoiding unnecessary hysterectomy or laparotomy for the vast majority of women with benign uterine masses. While there are differences in the patient populations for the two disorders, there is substantial overlap.</p><p>There are several histologic types of uterine sarcoma. The main type of sarcoma that may resemble a leiomyoma is leiomyosarcoma, which typically presents as a myometrial mass. Endometrial stromal sarcoma may present as an endometrial or myometrial mass.</p><p>Historically, hysterectomy was the mainstay of treatment for women with a uterine mass. Thus, if uterine sarcoma was present and identified postoperatively on pathologic analysis, there was no missed diagnosis and the treatment received was incomplete but did not worsen prognosis. In current practice, women with presumed benign leiomyomas may be treated with a variety of uterine-sparing alternatives to hysterectomy, including medication, imaging-based interventions (ie, uterine artery embolization or magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound), and conservative surgery (myomectomy or endometrial ablation). Nonexcisional therapies for fibroid-related symptoms (eg, medical treatments, endometrial ablation, interventional radiology procedures) do not produce specimens for pathologic examination. Thus, the diagnosis of malignant neoplasm may be missed. In addition, procedures or techniques that disrupt a uterine mass (ie, myomectomy or hysterectomy, especially when the specimen is morcellated) may disseminate neoplasm. Equally important priorities, however, are to avoid unnecessary surgery for the purpose of excluding the rare sarcoma and also to offer the option of minimally invasive approaches in patients at low risk for sarcoma, many of whom have not completed their childbearing.</p><p>Approaches to differentiating benign uterine leiomyomas from uterine sarcoma are reviewed here. General principles of the diagnosis of uterine leiomyomas, the diagnosis and treatment of uterine sarcoma, and benign and atypical smooth muscle neoplasm variants are discussed separately.

The majority of cases are leiomyosarcoma, a highly aggressive cancer, but there are also reports of cases of endometrial stromal sarcoma, generally a more indolent cancer. Representative studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included 23 studies published from 2015 to 2017. The rate of unsuspected uterine sarcoma (any histologic type) in women undergoing surgery for presumed benign fibroids ranged from 0 to 1.48 percent, and for leiomyosarcoma from 0 to 0.51 percent. Meta-analysis showed the following prevalences: any uterine sarcoma (0.277 percent, 95% CI 0.172-0.445; 1 in 361) and leiomyosarcoma (0.134 percent, 95% CI 0.089-0.202; 1 in 746) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk increased with age, and for any uterine sarcoma, approximate rates were the following: 40 to 50 years (0.15 to 0.22 percent), 50 to 60 years (0.58 percent), and 60 years or older (1.5 to 2.8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis including 64 prospective studies (5223 women) and 70 retrospective studies (24,970 women) of women who underwent surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The overall rate of leiomyosarcoma was 0.05 (1 in 2000) surgeries; in prospective studies, it was 0.01 percent (1 in 8300) surgeries, and in retrospective studies, it was 0.06 percent (1 in 1700) surgeries. There are several possible explanations for the significantly lower rate in the prospective studies. There may be less selection bias than in retrospective studies. Also, in the prospective study group, more than one-half of the studies were of women undergoing myomectomy, suggesting these women may be younger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have less clinical suspicion of malignant neoplasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest study that evaluated unexpected malignant neoplasm of all types in women who underwent morcellation was a report from a United States insurance database, including 232,882 women who underwent minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]) hysterectomy, which found that morcellation was performed in 36,470 (15.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among the women who had morcellation, there were 99 cases of uterine cancer including sarcomas and endometrial carcinomas (0.27 percent, 1 in 370), 39 uterine neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential, 368 cases of endometrial hyperplasia (most cases were without atypia (non-neoplastic) and thus not thought to have a premalignant phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]), and 26 other gynecologic malignant neoplasms. The prevalence of malignant neoplasm was 0.34 percent and of all neoplasms was 1.5 percent, although the clinical significance of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia is uncertain. Presence of malignant neoplasm was associated with increasing age; compared with women age 40 years, the prevalence ratios were: 50 to 54 years, 4.97; 55 to 59, 19.37; 60 to 64, 21.36; and &ge;65, 35.97. In absolute numbers, the prevalence of cancer in this series for women under age 40 was <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1500</span> and for women 40 to 44 was <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1100</span>. A limitation of the study was that the histology of the uterine malignant neoplasm cases was not reported. These data add support to limiting morcellation to premenopausal women, since 50 years old is approximately the average age of menopause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study for all uterine sarcomas from 2006 to 2013 from a health care system included 34,728 hysterectomies and reported a rate of occult uterine sarcoma of 0.36 percent (1 in 278) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In this study, risk was strongly related to age, with adjusted relative risk of 2.5 for women ages 50 to 59 and 12.8 for women &ge;60 years compared with women 50 years and younger. However, because of the larger number of hysterectomies performed in younger women, 48 percent of occult sarcomas were diagnosed in the youngest age strata.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 4791 women in Norway undergoing surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas included 26 women who were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, but only six (0.1 percent) of these had no preoperative findings suspicious for malignant neoplasm; among the other women, six were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma on endometrial biopsy prior to surgery and 14 had findings suspicious for malignant neoplasm and thus underwent open hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The mean age of women with leiomyosarcoma (including a total of 26 women, some of whom had preoperative findings suspicious for malignancy) was 61 years and the majority were postmenopausal (70.4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another large study evaluated the finding of unexpected gynecologic malignant neoplasm in a population-based database that included 6360 women undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications, a broader population than those undergoing morcellation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The incidence of unexpected gynecologic malignant neoplasm was 2.7 percent, including ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinoma (1.1 percent); endometrial malignant neoplasm (1.0 percent); uterine sarcoma (0.2 percent); cervical carcinoma (0.2 percent); and metastatic malignant neoplasm (0.2 percent). Interestingly, in this study, there was no difference in mean age of women with an unexpected diagnosis of sarcoma compared with those with benign pathology (46.9 versus 47.0 years), although this was based on a total of 14 patients. In all patients with sarcoma, there was a pattern of increasing age (14 with benign preoperative indications and 10 with malignant preoperative indications): three were age &lt;40 years, five were 40 to 49 years, and 16 were &gt;50 years. Of the undiagnosed sarcomas (14 of 6360, or a risk of 0.2 percent, 1 in 454), nine had a diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding (and thus should have had further preoperative evaluation). Limitations of this study include that it did not provide data regarding risk factors for uterine malignant neoplasm (eg, Reed syndrome in young patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]), preoperative evaluation, or the surgical approach or technique (eg, laparoscopy, morcellation). It also did not specify whether the malignant neoplasm was discovered intraoperatively or on postoperative pathology, which are different clinical scenarios in terms of ability to perform an appropriate staging procedure and avoid tissue dissemination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large single center study included 10,119 women who underwent hysterectomy for benign indications. Nine patients were found to have uterine sarcoma (0.09 percent, 1 in 1124) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The indication for hysterectomy in all women with occult sarcoma was abnormal uterine bleeding or pelvic mass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regarding myomectomy, data from a national United States hospital database of 41,777 women undergoing myomectomy, including 3220 women who underwent myomectomy with electromechanical morcellation, reported that 0.43 percent had a pathologic finding (malignant neoplasm, neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential, or endometrial hyperplasia) and 0.09 percent had uterine cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among all myomectomy patients, increasing age was significantly associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer. The risk of occult uterine cancer stratified by age was &lt;40 years 1 in 2337, 40 to 49 years 1 in 702, 50 to 59 years 1 in 154, and &ge;60 years 1 in 31. These data support the US FDA guidance that electromechanical morcellation should not be used in peri- and postmenopausal women with a uterine tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1940486998\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine sarcoma or other uterine cancer may be discovered in women after hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse. This is a challenging issue because these women do not usually have abnormal uterine bleeding and thus may not undergo endometrial sampling or pelvic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, these women may be less likely to have morcellation since the treatment of choice for most women would be a vaginal hysterectomy due to the prolapse and need for concomitant vaginal procedures to repair the prolapse. In a large study of this issue, among 1196 women who underwent hysterectomy for prolapse, malignant neoplasm was found postoperatively in 0.3 percent and endometrial hyperplasia in 0.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There were no specimens with sarcoma. Another study included 640 women who underwent hysterectomy for prolapse; three cases of malignant neoplasm were identified and one case was sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16656371\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessing clinical characteristics is the initial approach to evaluating a patient with a presumed leiomyoma in whom there is some concern of uterine sarcoma. Suspicion of sarcoma may change based upon a patient's risk factors or response to treatment.

The relative risk and incidence of leiomyomas is two- to threefold greater in black women than in white women.

Leiomyomas typically stabilize or diminish in size following menopause. Postmenopausal estrogen therapy may be associated with modest growth of myomas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent symptoms but does not appear to induce the development of new leiomyomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Prevalence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Women on hormone therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, increasing age is a significant risk factor for uterine sarcomas. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years; thus, the majority of sarcomas occur after menopause. Young age does not exclude the diagnosis of uterine sarcoma, however, since it has been reported in women as young as their mid-20s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As an example, in a study of uterine sarcoma cases from 2000 to 2012 in a United States cancer database, the incidence was more than fourfold higher in women &ge;50 years old compared with younger women (6.4 versus 1.5 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The level of suspicion may be lower in women who are on postmenopausal estrogen therapy and have a small increase in the size of a fibroid known to present prior to menopause. In this subgroup, a trial of discontinuing postmenopausal estrogen therapy is an option to see if regression occurs.

These findings are helpful to follow changes in the uterus over time <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to aid surgical planning. A fixed mass is more suggestive of a malignant neoplasm than a mobile mass. However, this is not pathognomonic, since a malignant neoplasm that has not invaded the uterine serosa may be mobile, and a mass associated with endometriosis or pelvic infection may be fixed. Unfortunately, there are no examination findings that can distinguish a leiomyoma from a uterine sarcoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1366333719\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening and evaluation for gynecologic malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to treatment for presumed leiomyomas, women should undergo routine screening for cervical neoplasm.

A full menstrual history and a history of risk factors for endometrial carcinoma (including Lynch syndrome) should be elicited. Pelvic imaging or endometrial sampling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 1</a>) should be performed if appropriate.

Leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas appear similar; both are focal masses within the uterus and both can have central necrosis. Pelvic ultrasound followed by MRI is the most useful imaging strategy.</p><p>Pelvic ultrasound is typically the first-line study to evaluate women for potential uterine pathology. Sonographic evaluation of a uterine mass may identify features suggestive of sarcoma (mixed echogenic and poor echogenic parts; central necrosis; and color Doppler findings of irregular vessel distribution, low impedance to flow, and high peak systolic velocity); however, many of these characteristics may also be found in benign leiomyomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>MRI may be helpful in women in whom there is a suspicion of sarcoma; however, it does not provide a definitive diagnosis.

A consistent finding in leiomyosarcomas is the absence of calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Calcifications suggest that the mass has undergone necrosis. This is most typically seen in fibroids that have outgrown their blood supply (for example, postpartum or after uterine artery embolization) or in postmenopausal women as blood flow to the uterus regresses. Some data suggest that ill-defined margins are consistent with a sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Two small studies using different techniques of MRI with gadolinium contrast have reported specificities of 93 to 100 percent and positive predictive values of 53 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

Finally, the presence of intralesional hemorrhage appears to be suggestive of sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/48,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55</a>]. Further study of use of MRI for this purpose is needed.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) does not reliably differentiate between leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/CT</span> with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) does not appear to be useful to distinguish between leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas.

In addition, it is theoretically possible for a sarcoma to remain indolent for a long period of time and only come to diagnostic attention when a more aggressive phase of disease is entered.</p><p>The teaching about rapid growth of a uterine mass being associated with an increased risk of uterine sarcoma was <strong>not</strong> substantiated in a study of 1332 women who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy of presumed uterine leiomyomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence of uterine sarcoma was low for all women, with a similar incidence in the 371 women with a rapidly growing uterus by clinical or ultrasound examination (one uterine sarcoma, 0.27 percent) and in the 961 without rapid uterine growth (two uterine sarcomas, 0.15 percent). In addition, a literature review of 26 studies found that a history of rapid uterine enlargement was documented in only 15 of 580 patients (2.6 percent) with uterine sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, the great majority of premenopausal women with a rapidly enlarging uterus or uterine mass do not have a sarcoma.</p><p>In contrast, because leiomyomas are stimulated by estrogen and progesterone, postmenopausal women who have a uterine mass that is new or is growing at either a slow or rapid pace should be evaluated for malignancy. The level of suspicion for uterine sarcoma is lower in women who are on postmenopausal estrogen therapy and have a small increase in the size of a presumed fibroid known to have been present prior to menopause.

This may be performed using an electromechanical morcellator device, as is commonly done during laparoscopy, or with a scalpel, commonly done during vaginal hysterectomy. The risk of dissemination of tissue and other risks during morcellation is discussed in detail separately.

With laparotomy, the specimen is not usually morcellated, so the only tissue disruption is the incision to amputate the uterine cervix. With laparoscopy, the specimen is typically morcellated, which likely results in greater tissue dissemination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-tissue-extraction-by-morcellation-techniques-and-clinical-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine tissue extraction by morcellation: Techniques and clinical issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are few data about the risk of neoplasm dissemination and worsened prognosis with supracervical hysterectomy. The only study to address this issue included 12 women with endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma who underwent supracervical hysterectomy without morcellation; 9 of 12 underwent subsequent surgery for restaging, and none were upstaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Intraperitoneal myomectomy is performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy. With laparotomy, the specimen(s) are not usually morcellated, but there may be multiple fibroids, and there is usually substantial exposure of myometrial tissue. With laparoscopy, the specimen is typically morcellated. Smooth muscle cells have been found in pelvic washing after myomectomy and morcellation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>There are few data about the risk of neoplasm dissemination and worsened prognosis with myomectomy. No studies have examined women who underwent myomectomy without morcellation. One retrospective cohort study of 30 women with uterine sarcoma diagnosed postoperatively who underwent myomectomy with morcellation (electromechanical or scalpel morcellation) were compared with women who underwent total hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. At five years, there were no significant differences in recurrence-free survival (24 versus 46 percent) or overall survival rate (38 versus 43 percent), but the trend was toward a lower rate with myomectomy combined with morcellation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23337512\"><span class=\"h2\">Should hysterectomy be performed to exclude uterine sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most premenopausal women with presumed uterine leiomyomas, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, we recommend <strong>not</strong> performing hysterectomy for the sole purpose of excluding malignant neoplasm. Reasonable exceptions to this are women with endometrial sampling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results that strongly suggest sarcoma, those with thoracic imaging consistent with lung metastases, those with constitutional symptoms suggestive of malignancy, or those with multiple risk factors for uterine sarcoma.</p><p>The best clinical estimate of the likelihood of uterine sarcoma depends upon a constellation of factors. Unfortunately, preoperative and intraoperative findings are of limited value in diagnosing a uterine sarcoma. Factors that may raise a suspicion of sarcoma include symptoms, risk factors, failure of response to prior therapy, and the findings of MRI and endometrial sampling. (See <a href=\"#H1430439\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23337528\" class=\"local\">'Failure to respond to treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21562275\" class=\"local\">'Choice of imaging modality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H289628\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> above.)</p><p>In the rare cases in which a woman presents with a uterine mass and symptoms of lung lesions (eg, dyspnea), evidence of lung metastases on thoracic imaging greatly increases the likelihood of a malignant process. However, benign metastasizing leiomyomas is a benign condition that may also present with lung lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H9293634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Benign metastasizing leiomyomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21561641\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy should not be performed in most women with asymptomatic presumed leiomyomas for the sole purpose of excluding a uterine sarcoma.</p><p>The most important factor in such decisions is the rarity of uterine sarcoma. The likelihood of finding sarcoma in women with a preoperative diagnosis of leiomyomas has been consistently reported in observational studies of 1000 or more women as approximately 0.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/7-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-16</a>]. These data are from symptomatic women, so the risk is likely much lower in asymptomatic women. This risk is much lower than the risk of severe complications associated with hysterectomy (3.5 to 11.0 percent) for benign disease found in studies of 1000 to 30,000 hysterectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. This recommendation is in agreement with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which advises that there is insufficient evidence to support hysterectomy for asymptomatic leiomyomas solely to rule out malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Given these data, the risk of a missed diagnosis of sarcoma in a small number of women does not appear to outweigh exposing significantly more women to the risks of unnecessary hysterectomy. In our practice, the primary exceptions we make to this are for women in whom endometrial sampling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI strongly suggests sarcoma or those with thoracic imaging consistent with lung metastases. Hysterectomy is also a reasonable option for women with multiple risk factors for uterine sarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H1430439\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21562275\" class=\"local\">'Choice of imaging modality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H289628\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> above.)</p><p>Following the detection of presumed uterine fibroids in an asymptomatic woman, there are no high-quality data to guide follow-up. We order an initial imaging study (usually an ultrasound) to confirm that a pelvic mass is consistent with a fibroid rather than with other etiologies (eg, ovarian mass). After this initial evaluation, we perform annual pelvic examinations. If the characteristics of the uterus change or symptoms develop, we proceed with further evaluation and patient counseling regarding treatment options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Expectant management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21561648\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with symptomatic presumed leiomyomas, hysterectomy is one of several treatment options. The best treatment option should be chosen based upon the patient's symptoms, findings on evaluation, plans for future pregnancies, and patient preferences.</p><p>The advantage of hysterectomy is that it prevents the formation of new fibroids and also can treat concomitant problems such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, and cervical neoplasia. The disadvantages are loss of fertility, risk of surgical complications, the time needed for recovery, and risk of long-term morbidity and earlier menopause, especially if the ovaries are removed at the time of hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. In some women, the question may arise of whether to choose hysterectomy in order to exclude malignancy rather than a conservative treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with women with asymptomatic presumed leiomyomas, for most women with a symptomatic uterine mass, we recommend <strong>not</strong> choosing hysterectomy rather than other treatments based solely upon the goal of excluding malignant neoplasm. Reasonable exceptions to this are women with endometrial sampling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI results that strongly suggest sarcoma, thoracic imaging consistent with lung metastases, or multiple risk factors for uterine sarcoma.</p><p>On the other hand, for women deciding between several options for treatment of symptomatic fibroids, excluding malignant neoplasm may be a potential benefit of hysterectomy. As noted above, uterine sarcoma is rare, but the prevalence is greater in symptomatic than asymptomatic women. Nonetheless, the risk of a complication of hysterectomy exceeds the risk of finding an undiagnosed malignant neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In addition, women who fail to respond to conservative therapy may have an increased risk of sarcoma and also may require definitive treatment. Thus, excluding malignancy may be one factor that influences the decision regarding whether to choose treatment with hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1430439\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23337528\" class=\"local\">'Failure to respond to treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21562275\" class=\"local\">'Choice of imaging modality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H289628\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3405629\"><span class=\"h2\">Should unplanned hysterectomy be performed based on intraoperative findings?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During myomectomy or other pelvic surgery, a surgeon may encounter findings suggestive of a uterine sarcoma. Intraoperative findings rarely indicate the need for an unplanned hysterectomy, and sending pathology samples for evaluation and planning a potential second surgery pending the results is usually prudent, especially for women who desire future childbearing. It is prudent to include, at the time of preoperative consent, discussion of plans in the event of diagnosing a malignant neoplasm intraoperatively based on the updated guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration. Gross characteristics of a tumor may be suggestive of sarcoma but are not diagnostic. Frozen section analysis is often inconclusive. (See <a href=\"#H23336991\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>The only indications for hysterectomy are a definitive frozen section diagnosis of sarcoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gross evidence of metastases. One note of caution is that women with apparent intra-abdominal metastases may have a primary neoplasm at another site or leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata, which is a rare and benign condition. Unplanned hysterectomy should not be performed in women of reproductive age without a pathologic diagnosis of sarcoma. Additionally, because oophorectomy has not been shown to influence prognosis for leiomyosarcomas, ovarian preservation may be carried out in the case of unexpected intraoperative findings of sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

Sarcomas typically have complex karyotypes and aneuploidy, while leiomyomas have characteristic rearrangements, many of which are shared by other benign neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The most compelling evidence comes from a rare subgroup of leiomyomas with cellular or atypical histology based upon data from two clinical and two molecular genetic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas/abstract/93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-96</a>].

Uterine sarcoma is rare (3 to <span class=\"nowrap\">7/100,000</span> in the United States population). The likelihood of finding a sarcoma in a population of women with an intrauterine mass, some of whom have risk factors for uterine sarcomas, is approximately 0.1 to 0.28 percent.(See <a href=\"#H16656355\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4483477\" class=\"local\">'Presumed benign leiomyomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations are not useful to distinguish between leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas, since both typically present with abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/pressure,</span> and a pelvic mass.

After menopause, on the other hand, a new or growing uterine mass warrants further evaluation. Postmenopausal hormone therapy may cause a small increase in the size of an existing leiomyoma. (See <a href=\"#H21562104\" class=\"local\">'Rapidly growing uterine mass'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16657504\" class=\"local\">'Increasing age and postmenopausal status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large uterine size (in excess of 20 gestational weeks) has <strong>not</strong> been shown to be associated with increased uterine sarcoma risk.

We suggest endometrial sampling for women with a uterine mass and who have signs, symptoms, risk factors, or other findings that raise suspicion of uterine sarcoma or endometrial carcinoma or for whom the planned procedure includes intraperitoneal morcellation. (See <a href=\"#H289628\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no pelvic imaging modality that can reliably differentiate between benign leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas. We suggest that women with a pelvic mass that is newly diagnosed or has changed markedly in size or mobility undergo a pelvic ultrasound as an initial imaging study rather than no imaging or imaging with another modality. (See <a href=\"#H1430514\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast may be helpful in women in whom there is a suspicion of sarcoma; however, it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. For women in whom uterine sarcoma is suspected based upon characteristics of the patient or mass or upon ultrasound findings, we suggest follow-up imaging with MRI rather than imaging with ultrasound alone or with other modalities.
