Discussions of drugs that inhibit the RAS for the treatment of hypertension, kidney disease, and heart disease are provided in other topics.</p><p>The classical (historical) view of the RAS pathway begins with renin cleaving its substrate, angiotensinogen (AGT), to produce the inactive peptide, angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE activation of angiotensin II occurs most extensively in the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105360 \">figure 1</a>). Angiotensin II mediates vasoconstriction as well as aldosterone release from the adrenal gland, resulting in sodium retention and increased blood pressure.</p><p>However, it is widely recognized that this classical view of the endocrine RAS pathway represents an incomplete description of the system. Instead of one simple circulating RAS, it is recognized that there are also several tissue (local) renin-angiotensin systems that function independently of each other and of the circulating RAS. In particular, angiotensin II generation at the tissue level by these local systems appears to have physiologic effects that are as important as circulating angiotensin II and, under some circumstances, <strong>more</strong> important than circulating angiotensin II.</p><p>Thus, the RAS includes local systems with autocrine (cell-to-same cell) and paracrine (cell-to-different cell) effects in addition to the classical circulating RAS with endocrine effects. Physiology of the RAS is proving far more complex than a simple circulating pathway controlling blood volume and blood pressure. In these local systems, activation of angiotensin II results in harmful effects and target-organ damage that extend beyond vascular and renal hemodynamics to direct tissue actions, including tissue remodeling, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis. A more detailed review appears below. (See <a href=\"#H7496798\" class=\"local\">'Tissue renin-angiotensin systems'</a> below.)</p><p>A teleological view holds that activation of the RAS was a critical adaptation for survival of mammals that migrated from sea to land, in defense against life-threatening circumstances like salt and water deprivation, diarrhea, or hemorrhage. While protective in its purpose, activation of the system in many patients today is maladaptive and leads to disease, with heart failure being a classic example. Sodium retention, coupled with hyperaldosteronism, results in vascular remodeling of the heart and disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Blockade of the RAS has represented a groundbreaking development in the prevention and treatment of heart failure, chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. There are a number of steps at which the RAS can be interrupted. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce renin release. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II downstream from the renin step, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) interfere with the interaction of angiotensin II with its receptor. A newer class of antihypertensive drugs, renin inhibitors, interfere with the first step in the cascade, which is the interaction of renin with its substrate, angiotensinogen.</p><p>Whether or not to block the RAS is no longer the appropriate question in the clinical scenarios of diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Efforts are dedicated to answering how best to optimize blockade. Discoveries of new peptides, enzymes, receptors, and cell-signaling targets of the system are changing our understanding of physiology and providing potential new therapeutic targets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32994947\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE RAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main components of the RAS are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7496176\"><span class=\"h2\">Renin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The afferent arteriole of each glomerulus contains specialized cells called the juxtaglomerular cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69949 \">figure 2</a>). These cells synthesize the precursor, prorenin, which is cleaved into the active proteolytic enzyme, renin. Active renin is then stored in and released from secretory granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Renin initiates a sequence of steps that begins with cleavage of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, from renin substrate (angiotensinogen [AGT]), an alpha-2-globulin produced in the liver (and other organs including the kidney) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This first step is also the rate-limiting step of the RAS cascade. Renal hypoperfusion, caused by hypotension or volume depletion, and increased sympathetic activity are the major physiologic stimuli to renin secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65116 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7496268\"><span class=\"h3\">Control of renin secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that regulate renin secretion are related to the classical actions of angiotensin II: increased sodium and water reabsorption; and systemic vasoconstriction. Short-term feedback of renin secretion is mediated via angiotensin II; angiotensin II binds to its receptor to inhibit renin gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Long-term feedback of renin secretion is mediated by the physiologic cycle of angiotensin II; angiotensin II increases blood pressure and sodium retention, which then inhibits renin release.</p><p>The changes in extracellular fluid volume that govern renin release are primarily sensed at three sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65116 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baroreceptors (or stretch receptors) in the wall of the afferent arteriole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac and arterial baroreceptors, which regulate sympathetic neural activity and the level of circulating catecholamines, both of which enhance renin secretion via the beta-1-adrenergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cells of the macula densa in the early distal tubule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69949 \">figure 2</a>), which appear to be stimulated by a reduction in chloride delivery, particularly in the chloride concentration in the fluid delivered to this site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]</p><p/><p>In normal subjects, the major determinant of renin secretion is sodium intake: a high intake expands the extracellular fluid volume and decreases renin release, whereas a low sodium intake (or sodium and water losses from any site) leads to a reduction in extracellular fluid volume and stimulation of renin secretion. Acute increases in renin secretion, such as those occurring with hypovolemia, primarily reflect the release of preformed renin from intracellular secretory granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Chronic, persistent stimuli to renin release lead to increased synthesis of new prorenin and renin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Increases in renin secretion produce increases in angiotensin II and aldosterone production, sodium reabsorption, and expansion of the extracellular fluid volume. By contrast, decreases in renin secretion produce decreases in angiotensin II and aldosterone production, sodium reabsorption, and reduction of the extracellular fluid volume. Intrarenal formation of angiotensin II probably plays at least a contributory role in the sodium retention induced by renin, as illustrated by the rise in messenger RNA for both renin and angiotensin substrate in the renal cortex following a low-sodium diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Measurement of renin in the context of adrenal disease is presented in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assays-of-the-renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system-in-adrenal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assays of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in adrenal disease&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plasma renin activity (PRA) is an indirect measure of renin that employs an enzyme-kinetic bioassay, which measures its capacity to generate angiotensin I. The rate of angiotensin I production, and therefore PRA, is critically dependent upon the concentration of substrate in plasma (ie, angiotensinogen).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plasma renin concentration (PRC) employs a direct immunosorbent assay that detects both prorenin and renin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>The question of which measure is more clinically meaningful is debated. In general, there is good correlation between PRA and PRC, with some notable exceptions. In pregnancy and in women taking oral contraceptive pills, an increase in angiotensinogen results in higher PRA than PRC, while, in patients with severe heart failure, low angiotensinogen concentrations result in lower PRA values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The value of measuring renin in pathologic states such as hypertension has been studied extensively. As an example, renin is frequently measured in patients suspected of having primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;, section on 'Initial testing'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, the usefulness of measuring renin in patients with primary (formerly, &quot;essential&quot;) hypertension is less clear. One theory holds that, in hypertensive patients with elevated renin levels, the hypertension is caused by arteriolar vasoconstriction, while, in patients with low renin levels, the hypertension is caused by expansion of the extracellular fluid volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This theory led to a proposal whereby treatment could be individualized based upon renin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, due to large variations in plasma renin measurements and in clinical responses to therapy, renin levels are <strong>not</strong> typically measured in patients with primary hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1648396228\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhibition of renin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renin was an attractive target for blockade of the RAS because it operates at the rate-limiting step (namely, the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I) and because renin is highly specific for its substrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) produce a reactive renin rise and, therefore, an increase in angiotensin peptides (angiotensin I increases with ACE inhibitors, and both angiotensin I and angiotensin II increase with ARBs). Only renin inhibition renders the RAS quiescent, suppressing all of the angiotensin products.</p><p>However, this effect has not translated into a clear clinical advantage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aliskiren-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aliskiren</a> (the sole available renin inhibitor) is effective and safe as a single antihypertensive agent, it should <strong>not</strong> be combined with an ACE inhibitor or ARB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Combination RAS blockade does not improve outcomes in most patients and increases adverse events. As a result, it is unlikely that renin inhibitors will gain a place in routine clinical care without favorable hard endpoint studies in nondiabetic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Despite its abundance, the physiological role of prorenin remains unclear, as no direct effect on systemic hemodynamics has been shown. In most individuals, prorenin accounts for up to 90 percent of circulating renin, while active renin accounts for 10 percent. However, in patients with longstanding diabetes, prorenin is greatly elevated and active renin is normal or low, such that 99 percent or more of circulating renin is prorenin. Higher levels of prorenin in patients with diabetes is associated with albuminuria, nephropathy, and diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. One study, for example, found that a rise in prorenin concentration among patients with diabetes independently predicted the subsequent onset of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The physiologic effects of prorenin in patients with diabetes are unknown.</p><p>Prorenin may be important for uterine function, particularly during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition to an intrauterine tissue RAS, an ovarian as well as a fetal RAS are also involved in normal pregnancy. These tissue systems appear to play key roles in ovulation, implantation, placentation, and development of the uteroplacental and umbilicoplacental circulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124065570\"><span class=\"h2\">(Pro)renin receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The existence of the (pro)renin receptor (PRR), a receptor for both prorenin and renin, was suspected based upon evidence demonstrating effects of renin that were independent of angiotensin II, and it was finally identified in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Binding of renin to the PRR causes a fourfold increase in the ability of renin to catalyze the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. When bound to the PRR, prorenin undergoes a conformational change that uncovers its active catalytic site, and therefore, prorenin can function as enzymatically active renin when bound to the receptor. In addition, binding of prorenin or renin to the PRR activates various signalling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) 1 and 2, transforming growth factor beta 1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).</p><p>The PRR is an aspartyl protease (the first such protease discovered). The receptor is abundantly expressed in the heart, brain, placenta, and eye, with lesser expression in the liver and kidney. Within the kidney, the receptor is localized in the mesangium of glomeruli and in the subendothelium of renal arteries, colocalizing with renin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The existence of the PRR in the heart and kidney may help to explain the responsiveness of diabetic patients to RAS blockade despite low levels of active renin (and high levels of prorenin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]; however, evidence for an important role of the PRR in cardiovascular or renal disease remains limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The PRR may also have functions unrelated to the RAS. As an example, animals have shown the importance of the PRR in embryonic development and stem cell biology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and genetic ablation of PRR produces an embryonic-lethal phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131690443\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensinogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensinogen (abbreviated as AGT), synthesized mainly by the liver, is the sole substrate for renin. The cleavage of AGT by renin represents the rate-limiting step in the enzyme cascade that makes up the classic circulating RAS. In addition to the liver, AGT is also produced in the&nbsp;brain, large arteries, kidney, adrenal glands, and adipose tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Because both plasma and tissue AGT concentrations contribute directly to circulating amounts of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, AGT appears to influence the degree of activation of the RAS and to play a role in regulation of local (tissue) renin-angiotensin systems. AGT is regulated by several hormones. Both oral estrogens and glucocorticoids stimulate AGT synthesis, but it is unknown whether this upregulation plays a major role in AGT activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. AGT gene variants appear to have a modest effect on blood pressure and are considered susceptibility alleles in some populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7496473\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin-converting enzyme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the octapeptide, angiotensin II. This conversion occurs most extensively in the lung by ACE generated in vascular endothelial cells; ACE is also located in the glomerulus as well as many other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Thus, the pleiotropic effects of pharmacologic ACE inhibition may be due in part to inhibition of local, tissue ACE, in addition to inhibition of ACE in the lung. However, the clinical significance of ACE inhibition in different tissues is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>ACE inhibitors were first developed by coincidence when scientists were searching for an explanation for hypotension induced by the venom of a pit viper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The theory that a stimulator of bradykinin metabolism might also be an inhibitor of ACE, since both substrates are cleaved by a peptidyl-dipeptide hydrolase, proved to be correct. ACE is a nonspecific enzyme, also acting as a kininase; ACE inhibitors therefore result in the accumulation of bradykinin, which is thought to be responsible for the cough sometimes caused by these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In addition to circulating angiotensin II, local production of angiotensin II occurs in the adrenal gland and contributes to aldosterone release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Both adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium also stimulate aldosterone secretion.

These renal actions contribute to extracellular fluid volume expansion, increased blood pressure, decreased serum potassium, and, when aldosterone is produced in excess, primary aldosteronism.

It is clear, however, that multiple extrarenal renin-angiotensin systems exist and that angiotensin II can be synthesized at a wide variety of sites, including the kidney, vascular endothelium, adrenal gland, heart, adipose tissue, gonads, placenta, liver, and brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/11,71,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,71,88,89</a>].

Major tissue renin-angiotensin systems capable of local angiotensin II generation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney &ndash; Clinically, the most important and best described local, tissue RAS lies in the kidney. Both mRNA and proteins for all components of the RAS have been found in specific sites within the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], and various factors may regulate the intrarenal RAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Hypovolemia, for example, leads to an increase in renal messenger RNA expression for both renin (in the glomerulus) and angiotensinogen (AGT; in the proximal tubule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The proximal tubule also contains ACE and angiotensin II receptors, suggesting that local angiotensin II formation can occur and stimulate sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The observation that the concentration of angiotensin II in renal interstitial fluid is approximately 1000 times higher than in the systemic circulation is consistent with a local effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In addition, intrarenal angiotensin II is much more responsive than circulating angiotensin II to sodium intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/68,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,97,98</a>]. These local effects could explain why ACE inhibitors are useful antihypertensive agents, even in patients with low plasma renin activity (PRA) and low circulating levels of angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/89,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,99</a>]. Similarly, animals that lack renal ACE are not able to produce angiotensin II locally and are protected against hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Unlike the conventional circulating RAS, the local intrarenal RAS can auto-amplify angiotensin II production, providing a continual source&nbsp;of the peptide to maintain vasoconstriction, antinatriuresis, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular endothelium &ndash; Local generation of angiotensin II also can occur in vascular endothelium, where it likely influences vascular tone and the development of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/11,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,102</a>]. As an example, hypovolemia increases angiotensinogen messenger RNA levels in aortic smooth muscle. If this results in enhanced release of angiotensinogen, then either locally produced or systemic renin could initiate the sequential formation of angiotensin I and, via endothelial ACE, angiotensin II. In addition, there is evidence supporting a role for the vascular tissue RAS in endothelial dysfunction and in arterial stiffness, which are seen in pathologic states including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system &ndash; A localized RAS has been identified within the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>] and may contribute to various disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. In stroke, for example, a cerebroprotective pathway is mediated by brain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), local generation of angiotensin (1-7) (abbreviated as Ang[1-7]) and signalling through Mas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart &ndash; Multiple components of the RAS are synthesized locally in the heart, although the importance of these tissue-derived hormones in cardiac pathology is not completely understood.

Circulating renin measures may correlate poorly with the activity of tissue renin-angiotensin systems. In some patients with primary (formerly, &quot;essential&quot;) hypertension, for example, angiotensin II appears to be responsible for persistent renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention, even though plasma levels of renin and angiotensin II are similar to those in hypertensive patients with normal renal perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. These findings suggest that there can be a selective increase in the activity of the tissue RAS in the kidney. A similar selective activation of the tissue RAS in the kidney may occur in stable heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], in diabetic nephropathy, and may explain racial differences in renal hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>There is no known way to obtain direct measures of tissue renin (or angiotensin II) in humans. Alternative (indirect) approaches to assessing tissue RAS are therefore required.</p><p>Indirect measurement of tissue RAS in the kidney is possible because there is substantial variation in angiotensin-mediated control of the renal circulation, and this can be ascertained by identifying variations in the renal vasodilator responses to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> or vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. As an example, healthy black compared with white individuals have a blunted increase in renal plasma flow when switching from a low-salt to high-salt diet, have a blunted decrease in renal plasma flow when administered angiotensin II, and have a marked increase in renal plasma flow when given an ACE inhibitor; this phenotype suggests that angiotensin II levels in the kidneys of these individuals are increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. This activated tissue RAS in the kidneys could sequentially produce increased sodium and water reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid volume, and reduced circulating plasma renin levels (ie, a &quot;low-renin&quot; state). As with diabetes, the apparent low-renin state in blacks may indeed be paradoxical, reflecting activation of the RAS locally in the kidney as well as other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The interaction between the RAS and prostaglandins may seem confusing since each stimulates the secretion of the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/15,111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,111-113</a>] and since they induce opposing vascular actions (vasoconstriction with angiotensin II and vasodilation with most prostaglandins). However, angiotensin II is a systemic vasoconstrictor, whereas the prostaglandins act locally because they are rapidly metabolized when they enter the systemic circulation. Thus, the net effect of simultaneous renal secretion of angiotensin II and prostaglandins is that angiotensin II can cause systemic vasoconstriction and raise the blood pressure, while the prostaglandins minimize the degree of renal vasoconstriction, thereby maintaining renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-renin-angiotensin-system/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>Finally, in addition to support for a local RAS active within tissues, accumulating data support the existence of an intracellular RAS and for &quot;intracrine&quot; (within-cell) actions of angiotensin II.

The classical (historical) view of the RAS pathway begins with renin cleaving its substrate, angiotensinogen (AGT), to produce the inactive peptide, angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II mediates vasoconstriction as well as aldosterone release from the adrenal gland, resulting in sodium retention and increased blood pressure. However, it is widely recognized that this classical view of the endocrine RAS pathway represents an incomplete description of the system. Instead of one simple circulating RAS, it is recognized that there are also several tissue (local) renin-angiotensin systems with autocrine and paracrine effects that function independently of each other and of the circulating RAS. (See <a href=\"#H7496170\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main components of the RAS are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105360 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H32994947\" class=\"local\">'Major components of the RAS'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renin is synthesized from the precursor, prorenin, in juxtaglomerular cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69949 \">figure 2</a>). Active renin is stored in and released from secretory granules and then cleaves the decapeptide, angiotensin I, from renin substrate (angiotensinogen). Renal hypoperfusion, caused by hypotension or volume depletion, and increased sympathetic activity are the major physiologic stimuli to renin secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65116 \">figure 3</a>). Circulating renin can be measured indirectly or, less often, directly; such measurements are often used in the context of adrenal disease.

When bound to the PRR, the ability of renin to catalyze the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I is increased fourfold. When prorenin binds to the PRR, it undergoes a conformational change that uncovers its active catalytic site, permitting prorenin to function as enzymatically active renin. In addition, binding of prorenin or renin to the PRR activates various signalling pathways. (See <a href=\"#H1124065570\" class=\"local\">'(Pro)renin receptor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensinogen is the sole substrate for renin. In addition to the liver, AGT is also produced in the&nbsp;brain, large arteries, kidney, adrenal glands, and adipose tissues. (See <a href=\"#H1131690443\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensinogen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ACE catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the octapeptide, angiotensin II. This conversion occurs most extensively in the lung by ACE generated in vascular endothelial cells; ACE is also located in the glomerulus as well as many other tissues.&nbsp;Thus, the pleiotropic effects of pharmacologic ACE inhibition may be due in part to inhibition of local, tissue ACE, in addition to inhibition of ACE in the lung. A homolog to ACE has been identified and named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 cleaves an amino acid from angiotensin II, forming angiotensin (1-7), which appears to regulate a pathway that has opposing physiology to ACE and angiotensin II. (See <a href=\"#H7496473\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin-converting enzyme'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensin II effects include arteriolar vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption by the kidney.

Beyond these effects, however, angiotensin II has a host of important and mostly deleterious actions. The vast majority of these effects are mediated by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Angiotensin II binding to the sparsely expressed angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) has effects that generally counteract its classical actions, producing vasodilation and natriuresis.
