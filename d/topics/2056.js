The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

In addition, we generally avoid antidepressants in patients with concurrent manic symptoms, substance use disorders, early age of onset of bipolar disorder, and a recent history of mania or hypomania (eg, within the last two to three months). The risk of treatment emergent switching, rapid cycling, and suicidality is discussed elsewhere in this topic.

Thus, each patient served as his own control. During the first three months of antidepressant therapy, the risk of mania was not elevated in patients treated with concurrent antimanic drugs.

The use of antidepressants for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar depression is controversial because of concerns that these drugs are not effective, and may harm patients by causing switches from depression to mania as well as rapid cycling.
