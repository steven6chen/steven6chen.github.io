Two thiazolidinediones (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a>) are currently available in the United States. In 2010, the European Medicines Agency suspended sales of rosiglitazone, and in June 2011, the French and German Medicines Agencies also suspended the use of pioglitazone, owing to concerns that the overall risks of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone exceed their benefits. A third, troglitazone, was the first drug in this class to be marketed but was removed from the market in both the United States and United Kingdom because it caused liver dysfunction and, in some patients, liver failure.</p><p>The pharmacology and use of thiazolidinediones will be reviewed here. Biguanides (only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> is currently available) and other oral hypoglycemic drugs are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-in-the-treatment-of-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metformin in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thiazolidinediones increase insulin sensitivity by acting on adipose, muscle, and liver to increase glucose utilization and decrease glucose production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The mechanism by which the thiazolidinediones exert their effect is not fully understood. They bind to and activate one or more peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>PPAR-gamma is found predominantly in adipose tissue, pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, macrophages, and the central nervous system (CNS). PPAR-alpha is expressed mostly in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and vascular walls. The various thiazolidinediones have differential effects on PPAR-gamma and PPAR-alpha. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rosiglitazone</a> is a pure PPAR-gamma agonist, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> also exerts some PPAR-alpha effects (similar to fibrates). This may account for the different effects that pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have on lipids and cardiovascular ischemic outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> below.)</p><p>The concentration of PPAR-gamma is increased in the skeletal muscle of obese and diabetic patients; the raised concentration correlates well with the serum insulin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It appears that the thiazolidinediones improve insulin responsiveness in skeletal muscle by facilitating glucose transport activity, thereby increasing rates of muscle glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In human adipocytes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> treatment has been reported to increase expression of genes involved in promoting lipid storage and decrease expression of genes associated with inflammation, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, the insulin-sensitizing effect of thiazolidinediones may be related in part to regulation of adipose tissue production of adipokines via PPAR-gamma activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the CNS, PPAR-gamma activation by thiazolidinediones may contribute to improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity by yet undefined mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, CNS PPAR-gamma activation mediates weight gain by promoting increased feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. This finding accounts, in part, for the weight gain associated with thiazolidinedione treatment. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Weight gain'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2711285366\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H648325537\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a thiazolidinedione is to be used, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> is preferred. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> is not recommended, because of the greater concern about its atherogenic lipid profiles and a potential increased risk for cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Patients who are currently treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> and not achieving glycemic targets (glycated hemoglobin [A1C] &lt;7.0 percent) should be changed to an alternative antidiabetic intervention. For patients who are treated with rosiglitazone, are achieving metabolic goals, and are tolerating their regimen without apparent complications, continuation of rosiglitazone can be considered (keeping in mind that changing from one medication to another always carries some risk). However, we prefer to switch to an alternative medication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p>In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed marked restrictions on the prescribing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> because of concerns about increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These restrictions were largely removed by the FDA in 2013 after a reevaluation of the Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes (RECORD) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) (aimed at educating clinicians about the cardiovascular side effects of rosiglitazone) was eliminated in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The absence of an adverse effect of rosiglitazone on cardiovascular risk, however, has not been excluded. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Rosiglitazone'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2010, the European Medicines Agency suspended sales of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and in June 2011, the French and German Medicines Agencies also suspended the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> because of the potential increased risk of bladder cancer and the concern that the overall risks of pioglitazone exceed its benefits.

In the absence of contraindications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> is considered initial pharmacologic therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes because of glycemic efficacy, absence of weight gain and hypoglycemia, general tolerability, and favorable cost (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 1</a>). Although thiazolidinediones are probably similar in efficacy to metformin as monotherapy, we do not generally choose thiazolidinediones over metformin for initial therapy of type 2 diabetes, due to concerns about adverse effects (weight gain, <span class=\"nowrap\">edema/heart</span> failure, fractures). However, for patients with contraindications to metformin or sulfonylureas, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> is an option for initial therapy.

Along the nephron, PPAR-gamma is most abundant in the collecting tubules, and the fluid retention with thiazolidinediones appears to result from PPAR-gamma stimulation of sodium reabsorption by sodium channels (called the epithelial sodium channel) in the luminal membrane of the collecting tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

The bone loss was associated with an increase in marrow adipocytes. In vivo studies suggest that this finding is mediated by rosiglitazone-induced activation of PPAR-gamma. PPAR-gamma2 isoform is an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Activation of PPAR-gamma2 results in diversion of bone marrow stromal cells from the osteoblast lineage into the adipocyte lineage, which subsequently leads to a decrease in bone formation rates and increase in adipogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. This process, in turn, may be regulated by the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system as rosiglitazone-induced activation of PPAR-gamma has been demonstrated to downregulate components of the IGF system both in vivo and in vitro, and IGF-1 is an important regulator of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>The adverse impact of thiazolidinediones on bone is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC), a four-year observational study, 666 diabetic patients, aged 70 to 79 years at baseline, had bone density assessment every two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thiazolidinediones-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].
