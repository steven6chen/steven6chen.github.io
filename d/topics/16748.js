In the era when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) was the sole active agent, overall survival in phase III trials was approximately 11 to 12 months. In the modern era, the average median survival duration is now approaching three years, and five-year survival rates as high as 20 percent are reported in some trials of patients treated with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These improvements have been mainly driven by the availability of new active agents, which include conventional cytotoxic agents other than FU, and biologic agents targeting angiogenesis and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).</p><p>This topic review will address the practical issues that arise when choosing the appropriate treatment strategy for individual patients with inoperable mCRC. General principles of chemotherapy treatment for mCRC, data from the clinical trials that support the recommendations, recommendations for systemic chemotherapy in older adult patients with mCRC, management of patients with potentially resectable liver metastases, and a compilation of chemotherapy regimens used for advanced CRC are discussed elsewhere.

In general, exposure to all active drugs, as appropriate, is more important than the specific sequence of administration. </p><p>Increasingly, biomarker expression is driving therapeutic decision-making in medicine. However, the biologic target(s) for most of the agents that are active against mCRC are unknown, with the following exceptions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit from MoAbs targeting the EGFR is restricted to patients whose tumors do not contain mutated <em>RAS</em> genes. Furthermore, evidence increasingly suggests that response to EGFR-targeted agents is unlikely in patients whose tumors harbor a <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation. Emerging data also suggest that the location of the primary tumor is another factor that influences the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents. (See <a href=\"#H6688281\" class=\"local\">'Agents targeting the EGFR'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit for immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors appears to be limited to the subset of tumors with high levels of microsatellite <span class=\"nowrap\">instability/dMMR</span>. </p><p/><p>Furthermore, the choice of regimen (particularly the cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone) is also influenced by the goals of chemotherapy, which differ according to the clinical scenario:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, treatment will be palliative and not curative, and the treatment goals are to prolong overall survival and maintain quality of life (QOL) for as long as possible.

Even selected patients with initially unresectable liver metastases may become eligible for resection if the response to chemotherapy is sufficient, although this is uncommon. This approach has been termed &quot;conversion therapy&quot; to distinguish it from neoadjuvant therapy that is given to patients who present upfront with apparently resectable disease. The key parameter for selecting the specific regimen in this scenario is not survival or improved QOL, but instead, response rate (ie, the ability of the regimen to shrink metastases).

In general, the decision to permit treatment breaks during initial therapy (ie, intermittent rather than continuous therapy) must be individualized and based upon several factors, including tolerance of and response to chemotherapy, disease bulk and location, and symptomatology. (See <a href=\"#H553389544\" class=\"local\">'Duration of initial chemotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p>The optimal duration of therapy for patients who have potentially resectable metastases is discussed elsewhere.

For patients with mCRC, the model of distinct &quot;lines&quot; of chemotherapy (in which regimens containing non-cross-resistant drugs are each used in succession until disease progression) is being abandoned in favor of a &quot;continuum of care&quot; approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This approach emphasizes an individualized treatment strategy that might include phases of maintenance chemotherapy interspersed with more aggressive treatment protocols, rechallenging patients who responded to first-line treatment with the same agents used first-line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>], as well as reutilization of previously administered chemotherapy agents in combination with other active drugs.

In one meta-analysis, the risk appeared to be higher in those over the age of 65 and in those with a prior history of an ATE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].

However, the decision as to whether to withhold bevacizumab in older adult patients with a history of prior ATE (stroke, myocardial infarction) must take into account the potential harm from less effective anti-tumor therapy. These patients have been routinely excluded from clinical trials testing the value of bevacizumab. However, there is no evidence that patients at highest risk for bevacizumab-related ATEs derive less benefit from the drug.

Palliative chemotherapy can relieve symptoms, improve quality of life (QOL), and prolong survival. There are eight classes of active agents for treatment of mCRC. The optimal way to combine and sequence these agents is not yet established. In general, exposure to all active drugs is more important than the specific sequence of administration. (See <a href=\"#H4256214653\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the therapeutic approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Increasingly, biomarker expression is driving therapeutic decision-making. Benefit from monoclonal antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is restricted to patients whose tumors do not contain mutated <em>RAS</em> genes. Furthermore, response to EGFR-targeted agents is unlikely in patients whose tumors harbor a <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation). Emerging data also suggests that the location of the primary tumor is another factor that influences the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents.
