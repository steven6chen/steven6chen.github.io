This topic will discuss maternal care after a fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">demise/stillbirth,</span> including parental support and counseling.

The family's anticipation of a joyous birth is supplanted by sadness, despair, confusion, and loss, including loss of a desired child, loss of self-esteem as a parent, and loss of confidence in the ability to produce a healthy child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Psychological sequelae include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety, which may adversely affect a subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a study in which one or both parents of 31 stillborn infants were interviewed twice regarding their views and experiences in the transitional process after the birth of a stillborn child, the interviewees described six &quot;qualities&quot; that summarized what they wanted from their caregivers: support in meeting with and separating from the baby, support in chaos, support in bereavement, explanation of the stillbirth, organization of their care, and understanding the nature of grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should be aware of these issues when they approach parents during the stressful situation of a fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">demise/stillbirth,</span> and they should be able to provide patient-centered, compassionate, psychosocial care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106510 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Supporting parents and creating a trusting relationship with them can affect how they respond to bereavement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. However, the best approach is unclear, as the effectiveness of various forms of intervention has not been evaluated rigorously, particularly in comparative trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The stillbirth counseling process has several chronologically distinct stages:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the time of diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When making plans for delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At delivery and immediately postpartum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the weeks after discharge and at the first postpartum visit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a &quot;wrap-up&quot; meeting when all laboratory and pathology results are available</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the patient is considering another pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CONVEYING THE DIAGNOSIS OF FETAL DEMISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of fetal death is based on an ultrasound examination that documents absence of fetal cardiac activity. Once fetal demise has been confirmed by ultrasound, the <span class=\"nowrap\">mother/couple</span> should be informed in person, expeditiously, in an empathetic and straightforward manner, in surroundings where <span class=\"nowrap\">she/they</span> can react privately. Staying with woman after delivering the diagnosis, possibly holding her hand, and spending as much time as she needs are important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-serious-news\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing serious news&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2112081498\" class=\"local\">'Emotional support'</a> below.)</p><p>The moment of diagnosis is often a very painful event for the prospective <span class=\"nowrap\">mother/parents,</span> as well as for the person conveying the information. Beginning at the time of diagnosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">women/couples</span> who lose a baby may experience the five stages of grief experienced by individuals when told that they have a terminal illness (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H8568114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Presentation'</a>.)</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Women/couples</span> usually ask: why did the death happen?, what do we do now?, and will it happen again? Unless it is clear why the fetus has died, the answers to &quot;why&quot; and &quot;will it happen again&quot; cannot be given. The <span class=\"nowrap\">woman/couple</span> should be told at the time of initial diagnosis that the provider will attempt to answer these questions when the necessary examinations have been completed and when all relevant information has been reviewed, but that this will take time, possibly weeks or even months, depending upon the studies.</p><p>One group developed a six-step protocol (SPIKES) for delivering bad news. Although developed for patients with cancer, it can be used in other settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The protocol provides details about the six steps involved in breaking bad news: setting up the interview with the patient and others she chooses to include, assessing the patient&rsquo;s perception of the situation, understanding the amount of information that the patient wants to receive, providing this information, addressing the patient&rsquo;s emotions with empathetic responses, and lastly summarizing and developing a plan.</p><p>Another group also provided guidance for delivering bad news [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The authors emphasized that communication is a skill that can be learned and for which training must be provided, because it is not a natural ability and does not necessarily improve with experience. Other important aspects for giving bad news included delivery by well-informed clinicians; finding an appropriate comfortable, quiet, and private environment in which to communicate the bad news; prompt but gradual transmission of information in understandable and patient-sensitive terms so the patient and the people she chooses to have with her can absorb it; and providing support both verbally and nonverbally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523822962\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERNAL MEDICAL NEEDS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal demise may occur in the setting of a maternal medical illness or obstetrical complications, which should be managed, as appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121819951\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal laboratory evaluation of women who have had a fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">demise/stillbirth</span> is controversial.

The approach should be guided by clinical, sonographic, and histopathologic findings and may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kleihauer-Betke test or flow cytometry to detect a large fetomaternal hemorrhage </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine toxicology</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serological testing for syphilis in women with a history of sexually transmitted infections and those who live in areas of high prevalence, or if this test has not been performed earlier in pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fasting glucose concentration or glycated hemoglobin level, which can be useful for excluding poor glycemic control as a cause of fetal demise in women who have not been evaluated for gestational diabetes and in those known to have diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood antibody screen to exclude red blood cell alloimmunization</p><p/><p>In women in whom there is a clinical suspicion (ie, maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms)</span> of a specific underlying disorder (eg, thyroid disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, abruption), tests targeted to identify the specific disorder are obtained. Such testing may include thyroid function tests, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody titers, liver biochemistry tests, fibrinogen concentration. </p><p>Routine serologic testing for infection is unlikely to be useful because many women have positive serologies from prior infections, which are unrelated to the stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cytomegalovirus titer (IgM, acute and convalescent IgG), toxoplasmosis titer (IgM, acute and convalescent IgG), parvovirus B19 titer (IgM), and a blood Listeria culture are obtained if indicated by maternal clinical, prenatal sonographic, or postnatal histopathologic findings. Diagnostic studies for specific infections are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-prevention-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and prevention of Listeria monocytogenes infection&quot;, section on 'Pregnant women'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The placenta, although contaminated by the birthing procedures and handling after delivery, can be cultured by peeling the amnion off of the chorion and swabbing this newly exposed chorionic surface. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be obtained by the delivering clinician or the pathologist. A complete discussion of maternal, fetal, stillborn evaluation, including techniques for obtaining and processing specimens, can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-stillbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of stillbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121820289\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal genetic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus as to when fetal genetic studies are indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If prenatal fetal genetic studies are desired, the two main approaches are (1) G-banding chromosome analysis for karyotype and (2) microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Either approach is reasonable; the best choice is controversial and depends on factors such as cost and suspicion of trisomy or a microscopic gene defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. We prefer microarray, which has the major advantage of being able to analyze DNA&nbsp;from nonviable cells. Cell culture is unnecessary, thus culture failure, which is common with fetal demise, is not a concern. </p><p>By contrast, G-banding for full karyotype analysis is performed on actively dividing fetal cells obtained from culture and arrested in the metaphase stage of mitosis. If G-banding analysis of fetal karyotype is planned rather than microarray, we suggest obtaining cells for analysis before delivery because they are more likely to be viable than cells obtained after delivery (cytogenetic success rate: 85 to 100 percent antepartum versus 13 to 35 percent success postpartum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. One option is to perform the amniocentesis during labor after placement of an epidural catheter. This avoids the need to offer an invasive intervention in the ultrasound suite when the parents first learn of the demise and are beginning to grieve. In a study including 240 fetal deaths &ge;12 weeks of gestation, successful G-banding karyotype was possible in 90 percent of cases in which amniocentesis was performed, 100 percent of cases that underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS), but only 13.5 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">stillborns/fetal</span> demises that underwent skin biopsy after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One-half of the skin biopsies were unsuitable for analysis, while all of the CVS and amniocentesis could be utilized.</p><p>The advantages of microarray and sample collection for genetic studies by either method are reviewed in more detail separately.

When the <span class=\"nowrap\">mother/parents</span> have accepted the diagnosis and are ready to discuss it further, a discussion about the timing of and procedure for delivery can ensue.</p><p>Intervention should be guided by <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/parental</span> desires. Some women may want to be admitted to the hospital immediately, which is reasonable. It is also medically appropriate, and possibly psychologically desirable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>], for the <span class=\"nowrap\">mother/parents</span> to go home and take time in deciding the next step. This is a controversial area as some studies have suggested that women who were induced &gt;24 hours after the diagnosis of stillbirth had an increased risk of anxiety years after the loss, compared with women whose labors were induced within six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The woman should be told that spontaneous labor usually begins within one to two weeks of fetal death in the majority of cases. Waiting for spontaneous labor to begin is an option and may avoid issues associated with induction; however, waiting also increases the risk of developing coagulation abnormalities, particularly if the fetal demise is retained for several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Coagulation abnormalities are due to the gradual release of tissue factor (also called thromboplastin) from the placenta into the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121818314\"><span class=\"h2\">Route</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal delivery is desirable because it is generally safer for the mother than cesarean delivery, even after a previous lower uterine segment cesarean delivery (see <a href=\"#H121821070\" class=\"local\">'Previous cesarean delivery'</a> below).

We administer 200 to 400 mcg of misoprostol vaginally, repeating the dose every three hours to a maximum cumulative dose of 1400 mcg in 24 hours. The mean expulsion time is 10 to 11 hours.

Complicated or traumatic grief describes a syndrome in which the individual does not return to the level of function and wellbeing at which he or she lived before the loss. It involves the persistence of reactions (eg, difficulty accepting the death, denial of the death, absence of grief, searching, preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased, avoidance of reminders of the deceased, auditory and visual hallucinations of the person who has died, symptoms of identification with the deceased) that are normal in the immediate period after a loss.

These disorders often coexist in a pregnancy, or one may occur in one pregnancy while another occurs in a subsequent pregnancy. For example, the birth of a SGA liveborn infant in a first pregnancy has been associated with stillbirth in a subsequent pregnancy, especially if the SGA birth was preterm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56032 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>].

(Refer to individual topic reviews on abruption, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and stillbirth).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PLANNING FUTURE PREGNANCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest a periconceptional visit to review the circumstances of the prior stillbirth and the interval medical history, and discuss risks and management of future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/5,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,92</a>].</p><p>There is no convincing evidence on the optimum interpregnancy interval after a stillbirth. It is reasonable to advise women to delay conception until they feel they have achieved psychological closure of the previous pregnancy loss, which typically takes at least 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Observational series suggest that women are more vulnerable to posttraumatic stress in the pregnancy subsequent to stillbirth when conception occurs soon after the loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>] and that mothers who deliver their next baby around the anniversary of their first baby's death are particularly vulnerable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. An additional consideration is that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be lower when the interpregnancy interval is more than six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpregnancy interval and obstetrical complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the cause of the prior stillbirth is unknown, there is no evidence that intensive monitoring in future pregnancies will make a significant difference in preventing stillbirth. Nevertheless, patients&rsquo; anxiety levels may be decreased with more frequent prenatal visits and frequent testing, such as nonstress tests and ultrasound examinations. Delivery before 40 weeks is often performed to provide the mother with some psychological reassurance and a measure of control over the pregnancy. Clinicians will need to decide on the timing of planned early delivery on a case-by-case basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/19,96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,96,97</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After confirmation of the fetal demise, the couple should be informed expeditiously, in an empathetic and straightforward manner, in surroundings where the parents can react privately. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Conveying the diagnosis of fetal demise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents should not be rushed into deciding the timing of delivery in the absence of serious maternal medical concerns. Spontaneous labor begins within one to two weeks of fetal death in the majority of cases. However, waiting for spontaneous labor increases the risk of developing coagulation abnormalities, particularly if the fetal demise is retained for several weeks. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the third trimester, we suggest induction of labor in women with Bishop score &gt;6 with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> in standard doses rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In women with an unfavorable cervix, we administer misoprostol vaginally before oxytocin (not concurrently). (See <a href=\"#H121820797\" class=\"local\">'Management of third-trimester demise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the late second trimester, we suggest use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> as the first-line agent for uterine evacuation rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Another reasonable regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-and-misoprostol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone-misoprostol</a> for pregnancies at 24 to 28 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H121820840\" class=\"local\">'Late second trimester'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the early to mid second trimester, we suggest dilation and evacuation rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> induction if a clinician with appropriate technical expertise is available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If technical expertise is not available, misoprostol is used for induction. (See <a href=\"#H121820968\" class=\"local\">'Early to mid-second trimester'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage women with antepartum fetal demise and previous cesarean delivery to attempt vaginal birth. However, we perform a repeat cesarean delivery if the patient chooses this type of delivery after counseling about the risks and benefits of both approaches. If the cervix is unfavorable in the third trimester, our preference is to use a mechanical method of cervical ripening followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> induction. For a second-trimester fetal demise in women with a single previous low transverse hysterotomy incision, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> is an acceptable alternative to mechanical methods of cervical ripening because the risk of rupture, although increased over baseline, is low. (See <a href=\"#H121821070\" class=\"local\">'Previous cesarean delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents should be offered choices about viewing and holding their baby. Developing a physical or visual connection with the baby makes the death real and helps prevent emotional withdrawal from the loss. (See <a href=\"#H523823121\" class=\"local\">'Helping parents connect with and separate from their child'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional support involves empathetic, honest communication between parents and hospital staff that acknowledges the specific needs and cultural practices of individual couples and the differing needs of the mother and father. People grieve in different ways and over varying time periods. (See <a href=\"#H2112081498\" class=\"local\">'Emotional support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's primary provider (eg, obstetrician-gynecologist, midwife) is usually responsible for coordinating care after fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">demise/stillbirth,</span> but may not be the primary person providing counseling. (See <a href=\"#H272040768\" class=\"local\">'Coordinating postpartum care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be offered the choice of postpartum care on a maternity floor or elsewhere in the hospital. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum accommodations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bereavement counselors can help parents through the decision process for disposition of remains and for obtaining a certificate of birth resulting in fetal death. (See <a href=\"#H723837675\" class=\"local\">'Disposition of remains'</a> above and <a href=\"#H723838061\" class=\"local\">'Death certificate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular communication with patients after discharge can help in assessing their emotional status, whether there are signs of depression, and whether professional referral is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Postdischarge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bereavement may precipitate or exacerbate suicidality and mental disorders such as complicated grief, major depression, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (See <a href=\"#H523823730\" class=\"local\">'Grief and bereavement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autopsy is suggested because the cause of stillbirth and, in turn, the risk of recurrence may be impossible to determine without fetal and placental pathologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Autopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For low-risk women with unexplained stillbirth, the risk of recurrence is approximately 8 to 11 per 1000 births, and most of these deaths occur preterm; recurrence occurs at term in 1.8 per 1000 births. The subsequent pregnancy is at risk for abruption, preterm birth, and birth of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pregnancy after stillbirth should be delayed until parents feel they have achieved psychological closure of the previous pregnancy loss. This typically takes 6 to 12 months. A preconception visit is helpful to review findings associated with the prior stillbirth and to plan care and management of future pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Planning future pregnancies'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Weiss L, Frischer L, Richman J.
