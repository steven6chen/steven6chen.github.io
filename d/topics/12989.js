Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic mycosis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While most infections are asymptomatic or self-limited, some individuals develop acute pulmonary infections or severe and progressive disseminated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis and clinical features of the various pulmonary syndromes that may result from <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> infection will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis, as well as the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis are discussed separately.

Sites commonly associated with exposure to <em>H. capsulatum</em> include chicken coops or farm buildings with large accumulations of chicken droppings, abandoned buildings, bird roost sites, caves, and wood lots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Activities that have been associated with exposure include excavation, construction, demolition, remodeling, wood cutting and gathering, exploring caves, and visiting campsites that are visibly contaminated with bat guano [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>].</p><p>Heavy exposure usually occurs with activities disturbing a large accumulation of droppings in an enclosed area, such as a cave or an attic. However, in many cases, patients recall no such exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histoplasmosis and its causative agent, <em>H. capsulatum</em>, are found worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,14</a>]. It is estimated that up to 500,000 new infections occur each year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among the endemic mycoses, histoplasmosis is the most common cause for hospitalization. </p><p><em>H. capsulatum</em> is most prevalent in the midwestern and central states along the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. It has also been recognized that <em>H. capsulatum</em> is sometimes observed beyond the Mississippi-Ohio River Valleys, with infections reported in Montana, Idaho, and California, as well as several mid-Atlantic states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16-20</a>]. In addition, <em>H. capsulatum</em> causes disease in Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, as well as in parts of eastern and southern Europe, Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Although histoplasmosis occurs most commonly in individuals who live in endemic regions, outbreaks have been reported in travelers with exposures to <em>H. capsulatum</em>. As an example, clusters of histoplasmosis have occurred in travelers to Mexico who stayed in a hotel that was undergoing construction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and among members of mission groups that renovated a church in El Salvador [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lungs provide the portal of entry for <em>H. capsulatum</em> in the vast majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], the rare exceptions being transmission from an infected organ in patients who have undergone transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and sharps injury in persons working with the organism in the laboratory. Conidia or mycelial fragments are inhaled and, if they evade nonspecific lung defenses, cause a localized or patchy bronchopneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The clinical spectrum of acute histoplasmosis varies according to the extent of exposure, presence of underlying lung disease, general immune status, and specific immunity to <em>H. capsulatum</em>. With low-inoculum exposure, most otherwise healthy individuals remain asymptomatic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75641\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75641 \">figure 1</a>). However, patients who inhale a large inoculum can develop a severe and potentially fatal acute diffuse pulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>].</p><p>Macrophages initially are able to ingest but not kill the fungi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86524 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Infected macrophages serve to disseminate the infection hematogenously during the first two weeks of infection, before specific immunity has developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis&quot;</a>). Dissemination is usually clinically silent and may result in the development of <em>H. capsulatum</em>&ndash;containing granulomata in the liver and spleen, which may later be discovered incidentally on computed tomography (CT) scan or at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Progressive, clinically evident dissemination occurs primarily in patients with underlying immunosuppressive disorders, those at the extremes of age, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients who have experienced an unusually heavy exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Cellular immunity to <em>H. capsulatum</em> develops approximately 10 to 14 days after exposure; it is demonstrable first in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes and then throughout the reticuloendothelial system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Sensitized T lymphocytes activate macrophages to develop fungicidal properties, and the infection is brought under control in immunocompetent hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma play critical roles in defense against <em>H. capsulatum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Progressive illness with both pulmonary and extrapulmonary infection occurs in the absence of intact cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Histoplasmosis is the most common fungal infection seen in patients who are treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The infection tends to be aggressive, and dissemination occurs in most patients. The package inserts for the TNF-alpha inhibitors warn physicians and patients of the heightened risk for development of severe histoplasmosis while taking these agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections&quot;, section on 'Histoplasmosis'</a>.)</p><p>A heightened immune response is believed to occur following reinfection in persons with preexisting cellular immunity to <em>H. capsulatum</em>, accounting for a shortened clinical course despite the diffuse, intense inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma, which is often observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,41</a>]. The augmentation of the inflammatory response that is suspected clinically has been difficult to study in experimental models but may play a role in the pathogenesis of caseating tissue necrosis seen in some patients with histoplasmosis, including those with chronic pulmonary manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Fibrosing mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and a sarcoidosis-like syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] may occur in individuals who exhibit an atypical immunologic or inflammatory response to <em>H. capsulatum</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer than 5 percent of exposed individuals develop symptomatic disease after a low level exposure to <em>H. capsulatum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Radiographs typically show focal infiltrates and mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Histoplasmosis often is mistaken as community-acquired pneumonia and only considered after there is no response to empirical antibacterial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Fever, chills, headache, myalgia, anorexia, cough, and chest pain generally develop between two and four weeks after exposure but may be seen within one week in more heavily exposed cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,48</a>]. Coryza and sore throat are not typical of histoplasmosis and should suggest alternative diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Chest pain usually is described as substernal and often is aggravated by deep inspiration; patients may experience pleuritic pain if lesions abut the pleura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Physical examination usually is unremarkable except for fever but may reveal rales and evidence of consolidation. Symptoms typically resolve within several weeks, but fatigue and asthenia may persist for months, particularly in patients with more severe initial manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,49</a>].</p><p>Pathologically, the pulmonary lesion is characterized by a lobular or acinar bronchopneumonia, initially with neutrophilic infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Recruitment of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, and the formation of granulomas with conspicuous giant cells occurs at the second week and beyond; central caseous necrosis occurs later during the second month (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74406\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74406 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Chest radiographs usually show enlarged hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes with focal infiltrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69279\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69279 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79648\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79648 \">image 2</a>) but may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The pulmonary infiltrates usually are patchy or nodular; cavitation is rarely noted in the pulmonary infiltrates except in persons with underlying obstructive lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/43,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,50</a>]. Infiltrates may be diffuse or miliary following heavy exposure. Nodules measure between 1 and 4 cm in diameter and often are multiple. Of note, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in an immunosuppressed patient usually represent progressive disseminated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis&quot;</a>). Pleural effusions are seen in a minority of patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, and organisms are rarely isolated from pleural fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,52,53</a>].</p><p>Neither the time course for resolution of radiographic abnormalities nor the effect of antifungal therapy on the rate of clinical or radiographic improvement has been adequately studied.

Affected patients develop a productive cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, fevers, and sweats and have fibrotic apical infiltrates with cavitation on chest radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86523\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86523 \">image 4</a>) or computed tomography (CT) scans. The clinical and radiographic findings resemble those seen in reactivation tuberculosis; the two syndromes are often confused, and incorrect diagnoses have resulted in inappropriate treatment. One report described a fulminant and fatal case of diffuse necrotizing pneumonia with cavitation in a patient with underlying emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>These cavities tend to enlarge, involve new areas of the lung, and may result in the formation of bronchopleural fistulae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/42,43,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43,54</a>]. Pathologic examination reveals the presence of underlying emphysema, vascular compromise caused by intimal proliferation in small and medium-sized arteries, tissue necrosis, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Inflammation is disproportionate to the fungal burden, suggesting that hypersensitivity to fungal antigens may play a role in the pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Care must be taken to evaluate for both tuberculosis and histoplasmosis in patients who have these findings and who have lived in or been exposed to areas in which histoplasmosis is endemic.

Aspergilloma (ie, fungus ball), atypical mycobacterial infections, and chronic or recurrent pneumonia caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens may develop in areas of lung damaged by chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis and must also be excluded.</p><p>Most patients with chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis have smoked tobacco for long periods and are therefore at high risk for the development of lung cancer.

While most infections are asymptomatic or self-limited, some individuals develop acute pulmonary infections or severe and progressive disseminated infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> proliferates best in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings, which are believed to alter the soil characteristics favoring sporulation of the organism. Sites commonly associated with exposure to <em>H. capsulatum</em> include chicken coops or farm buildings with large accumulations of chicken droppings, abandoned buildings, bird roost sites, caves, and wood lots. Activities associated with exposure include excavation, construction, demolition, remodeling, wood cutting and gathering, and exploring caves. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Reservoir'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histoplasmosis and its causative agent, <em>H. capsulatum</em>, are found worldwide, particularly in North and Central America. In the United States, <em>H. capsulatum</em> is most prevalent in the midwestern and central states along the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, but also occurs in microfoci in several states along the East Coast. In addition to the United States, it is also found in Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, as well as in parts of eastern and southern Europe, Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lungs provide the portal of entry for <em>H. capsulatum</em> in the vast majority of cases. Conidia or mycelial fragments are inhaled and, if they evade nonspecific lung defenses, cause a localized or patchy bronchopneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis is the most common syndrome following infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis typically presents as a subacute pulmonary infection weeks to months following exposure. Symptoms are usually mild, and the events causing the exposure are difficult to identify. Radiographs typically show focal infiltrates and mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69279\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69279 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79648\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79648 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following extensive exposure, such as occurs with activities that disturb heavily contaminated soil or areas with large amounts of bird or bat droppings, the majority of patients develop acute diffuse pulmonary histoplasmosis within a week or two. Diffuse reticulonodular or miliary pulmonary infiltrates are noted and the disease can progress to respiratory failure or progressive extrapulmonary dissemination. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute diffuse pulmonary histoplasmosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with underlying lung disease are at risk for the development of chronic pulmonary infection following exposure to <em>H. capsulatum</em>. Affected patients develop a productive cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, fevers, and sweats and have fibrotic apical infiltrates with cavitation on chest radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86523\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86523 \">image 4</a>).
