Work-exacerbated asthma (also known as work-aggravated asthma) is defined as preexisting or concurrent asthma that subjectively worsens in the workplace.</p><p>OA is triggered by exposure to immunologic or nonimmunologic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Immunologic OA has a latency period during which the immunologic sensitization develops. Nonimmunologic OA has no latency period and is caused by exposure to high levels of irritants or repeated exposures to irritants at lower concentration; it is also known as irritant-induced asthma or reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>OA accounts for approximately 10 to 15 percent of adult onset asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. This implies that investigation of the causal relationship between workplace exposure and asthma is indicated in approximately one of every 7 to 10 subjects with adult-onset asthma. </p><p>The evaluation and diagnosis of suspected OA will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology definition, epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Management, prognosis, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental health&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history in patients with possible occupational asthma (OA) should include detailed information about the job description and potential exposures to causal agents, in addition to the routine evaluation of adult-onset asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinical history, while important, does not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of OA, although the negative predictive value is better than the positive predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All adults with asthma should be questioned not only about their current occupation and exposures, but also about their previous occupations and exposures. Once the patient&rsquo;s occupation is ascertained, the potential associated exposures can be evaluated in greater detail. Asking about exposure to vapors, gas, fumes, or dust may help the patient&rsquo;s recall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>As examples, the job description of &quot;engineer&quot; or &quot;clerk&quot; does not yield a full account of the actual exposures in the workplace, and either may be exposed indirectly to a sensitizing agent depending upon the particular work environment (eg, auto body shop, office building, epoxy paint factory). </p><p>Certain industries or professions are associated with greater contact with agents that have a high potential for provoking OA. As examples, nurses may be exposed to latex, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a>, pharmaceutical products, enzymes, glutaraldehyde, or formaldehyde, while spray painters may be exposed to diisocyanates, acrylates, and various amines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66185 \">table 1</a>). A description of the more common causative agents and their associated occupations is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors#H1191269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Causative agents'</a>.) Additional information on agents that cause OA is available at <a href=\"http://www.asthme.csst.qc.ca/document/Info_Med/IdCauses/Bernstein/AgentsAnglais.pdf&amp;token=f/pXwE4ORYwAllh0iyQxqbJ5Or2NM/0FxikJWU3v5tYF41hCPzGrng3fKgW/3P/S4l786vx66nHzUKIb15qeBsnFPSYn6Mj64ZN4z0gJt1iwCvKVkhLauGgmZWKRULCX&amp;TOPIC_ID=550\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.asthme.csst.qc.ca/document/Info_Med/IdCauses/Bernstein/AgentsAnglais.pdf</a>.</p><p>When OA is suspected, but the exact cause is unclear, it is important to obtain a list of all potentially causative agents. If the names of the chemicals in the workplace are not known, the worker can be asked to obtain the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) from the employer. In the United States, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that suppliers include a MSDS with each shipment of an industrial material or chemical, and workers are entitled to receive copies of these sheets. However, one should not depend entirely upon the information present in safety data sheets, because regulations stipulate that materials present in concentrations less than 1 percent need not be reported and high molecular weight compounds from animal and plant sources are typically omitted.</p><p>Asking about exposure to nonspecific irritants (eg, environmental tobacco smoke, strong fumes, extremes of temperature and humidity) is important as all types of asthma can be worsened by exposure to nonspecific irritants at work, a condition that is labeled work-exacerbated asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This sensitivity to nonspecific irritants is particularly likely among patients who are exposed to chemical products such as ammonia, engine-exhaust fuel, aerosols and solvents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], have severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are undertreated with medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>Few studies have investigated non-allergic irritant-induced asthma in which multiple irritant exposures at low concentrations appear to induce asthma in the absence of preexisting asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Since there is no specific testing that can prove that asthma has been caused by repetitive exposure to an irritant agent, it is often difficult to establish the diagnosis of irritant-induced asthma with certainty. However, epidemiologic studies suggest that some jobs, like cleaners and pulp mill workers, associated with exposure to high concentration of irritants are associated with an increasing risk for the occurrence of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Irritant-induced asthma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H866399778\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of occupational asthma (OA) is characterized by the following progression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80111 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of upper and lower airway inflammation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cessation or persistence of exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cure, improvement, or persistence of asthma</p><p/><p>The latency period between the onset of exposure and the onset of symptoms is highly variable in OA. In general, the latency period is shorter with exposure to low molecular weight (LMW) agents, such as diisocyanates and plicatic acid (Western red cedar), than with high molecular weight (HMW) agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66185 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, approximately 50 percent of subjects who develop OA due to diisocyanates experience symptoms within the first two years after the onset of exposure, whereas the median latency period after exposure to HMW agents is approximately five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The latency period also varies between high molecular weight agents; sensitization to laboratory animals occurs more commonly and rapidly than sensitization to flour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H866399597\"><span class=\"h2\">Atopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should take a history of preexisting asthma and atopy in all patients with asthma. However, these characteristics have a poor positive predictive value for the presence of OA. As an example, one study found that only approximately one-third of atopic subjects developed rhinoconjunctivitis or asthma symptoms in the five years following onset of exposure to laboratory animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Atopy is associated, though often weakly, with OA due to HMW agents, but because atopy is present in almost 50 percent of young adults, it cannot satisfactorily predict the development of OA. Preexisting asthma is not a predisposing factor for immunologic OA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5063656\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical symptoms of occupational asthma are the same as nonoccupational asthma and include cough, sputum production, dyspnea, wheeze, and chest tightness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5064106\"><span class=\"h2\">Pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pattern of increased symptoms while at work or within several hours of the completion of a shift, and a definite improvement on weekends or during vacations, is common in OA, but documenting this feature is not necessarily helpful. The value of this pattern of improvement of symptoms at weekends or in holidays as a discriminator for the diagnosis of OA, was examined in a study of 162 patients referred for possible OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Eighty-eight percent with confirmed OA stated that their symptoms improved during holidays, while 76 percent of patients without OA reported a similar improvement. In addition, the absence of this pattern does not exclude the possibility of OA.</p><p>Workers with more advanced OA and those who are only away from work for brief intervals are less likely to report this classic pattern, possibly due to a combination of early and late phase reactions that lead to persistent symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-asthma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of asthma&quot;, section on 'Early and late phase reactions'</a>.) Furthermore, workers may not be exposed to the etiologic agent every day, and intermittent exposures make it difficult to relate symptoms to work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5064099\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrapulmonary symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of work-related rhinoconjunctivitis (itchy eyes, tearing, sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea) often precede symptoms of OA caused by high molecular weight (HMW) proteinaceous agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-20</a>], or may accompany symptoms of OA caused by other high molecular weight agents and the low molecular weight agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The report of work-related wheezing, nasal symptoms, and ocular itching increases the likelihood of OA, especially among workers exposed to high molecular weight agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, these symptoms are not predictive in subjects exposed to low molecular weight agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors#H1191269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Causative agents'</a>.)</p><p>Several agents that cause OA (eg, diisocyanates, epoxies, latex, or cleaning agents) have been associated with allergic contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-29</a>]. However, the occurrence of contact dermatitis is generally not predictive of OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An exception comes from a study of adolescent car painting apprentices (exposed to diisocyanates) in which occupational dermatitis was predictive of work-related asthma like symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cobalt exposure has also been associated with the combination of OA and contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common allergens in allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Work-related urticaria on exposed body parts is sometimes seen with exposure to high molecular weight agents such as latex or crab and may suggest an IgE-mediated process, but there are no studies looking at its predictive value for the development of OA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86045157\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination in OA is generally nonspecific and may be normal during office visits away from the occupational exposure. Widespread, high-pitched wheezes are characteristic of asthma, heard most commonly on expiration, but sometimes also during inspiration. However, the presence or absence of wheezing on physical examination is a poor predictor of the presence or severity of OA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Physical findings'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with OA may also have pale, swollen nasal mucosa on examination of the nasal passages, suggesting concomitant occupational rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, an erythematous, scaling rash consistent with allergic contact dermatitis may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.) Also rarely, patients may present with a skin rash suggestive of urticaria on exposed body parts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344157802\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of disease processes have symptoms that mimic OA, such as asthma due to nonoccupational causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, work-related irritable larynx syndrome, upper respiratory tract irritation, hyperventilation syndrome, occupational rhinitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchiolitis obliterans. Certain distinguishing features can help to differentiate OA from the other diagnoses. The differential diagnosis of asthma and the diagnosis of occupational rhinitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H20489068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Workers can develop COPD due to personal or workplace exposure to tobacco smoke or other pollutants. A careful history can elicit the intensity and duration of these exposures. Spirometry will typically show a substantial component of irreversible airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) due to occupational exposure differs from occupational asthma by the absence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction. Sputum cell count analysis shows a significant increase in the percentage of eosinophils when the patient is exposed to the occupational agent to which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is sensitized, with a significant decrease after removal from exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work-related irritable larynx syndrome refers to hyperkinetic laryngeal symptoms triggered by sensory stimuli in the workplace, such as odors and irritants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This syndrome includes paradoxical vocal cord motion (PVCM, also known as vocal cord dysfunction), dysphonia due to laryngeal muscle tension (also known as muscle tension dysphonia), globus (ie, sensation of tension in the throat or neck), and chronic cough. In a case series, dysphonia was present in 86 percent and chronic cough in 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. PVCM can mimic asthma and OA, and can also coexist with these diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Typically, the diagnosis of PVCM is suspected when the patient has stridorous sounds, loudest above the throat and less audible through the chest wall, dysphonia, and an abnormal inspiratory flow volume curve, and does not respond as expected to treatment with an inhaled bronchodilator. Ascertaining the diagnosis requires the visualization of paradoxical motion of the vocal cords during symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;, section on 'Variable extrathoracic obstruction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperventilation syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed as asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,34</a>].

Unlike OA, hypersensitivity pneumonitis is typically associated with a restrictive ventilatory defect and interstitial opacities on radiographic imaging.

The diagnosis of asthma based on history alone may not be accurate, and therefore additional testing is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Baseline spirometry is obtained to determine the presence and severity of any airflow limitation.

The presence of a significant increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> (12 percent and &gt;200 mL) after inhaling a bronchodilator supports the diagnosis of asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;, section on 'Bronchodilator responses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of airflow obstruction, the next step is to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness to a pharmacologic agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> or histamine. If the FEV<sub>1</sub> does not decrease by 20 percent with a methacholine dose of 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> or less, the test excludes significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Absence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness could be due to lack of recent exposure to the sensitizing agent in a worker who has been away from work, but virtually rules out occupational asthma in a worker who has continued to work and is symptomatic. For patients who have been away from the workplace and have negative initial bronchoprovocation testing, repeat bronchoprovocation testing after an exposure to the causative agent (in the laboratory or at work) may then reveal bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

Several tests are available to determine whether a given patient's symptoms are caused by OA and whether a particular occupational exposure is the inciting agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most commonly used procedures involve monitoring peak expiratory flows, spirometry, or nonspecific bronchial reactivity during and away from work. Specific skin and immunoassay tests for occupational agents, assessment of airways inflammation, and specific inhalation challenges are less widely available. Only the latter tests can confirm the identity of the causative agent.</p><p>Stepwise schemes have been proposed for the diagnosis and management of OA using these various methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53605\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53605 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The exact order of testing depends on the available expertise and the degree of suspicion for a particular sensitizing agent. If a potential sensitizing agent has not been identified, supervised monitoring of peak expiratory flow rate or spirometry during and away from workplace exposures may be more appropriate as initial tests. If a likely causative agent has been identified and skin or immunologic testing is available, that testing may be performed first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344157636\"><span class=\"h3\">Peak expiratory flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) is useful in the investigation and assessment of occupational asthma (OA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. The subject is instructed on the proper use of the peak flow meter and asked to record his or her PEF a minimum of four times per day for a period of at least two weeks at work and during a similar period away from work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The period of testing at work should be shortened if the patient develops pronounced airway obstruction or has severe symptoms.</p><p>A number of potential problems are inherent to serial PEF monitoring, including the reproducibility of readings, compliance and honesty of subjects, interpretation of results, and sensitivity and specificity compared with specific inhalation challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Newer portable peak flow meters store values electronically, enabling identification of falsified patient logs. Interpretation of graphs of serial PEF measurements can be carried out by using a computer program called OASYS, although this is more typically used in workplace investigations than in the care of an individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Spirometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, all patients suspected of having OA should have baseline spirometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of asthma'</a> above.) Spirometry can also be used to measure serial changes in airflow limitation in and away from the workplace, similar to the procedure for serial PEF monitoring. Spirometry provides more detailed information about airflow and more reliable results than peak flow monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. On the other hand, a spirometer is more expensive than a peak expiratory flow meter and the technician training more complex. The spirometric parameter that is most reliable is the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>); changes in the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75 percent of vital capacity are less reliable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Interpretation'</a>.) </p><p>Comparisons between data from exposure and non-exposure days can support (or refute) work-related exacerbations of asthma. A single measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub> when the subject is at work and repeating once away from work (eg, pre and post shift) does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect a relationship between work and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>Periodic spirometry measurements can be used for workplace surveillance when occupational exposures place workers at risk for OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

This effect may last for years in patients with established OA, but in milder OA will last for at least a day or two. Thus, nonspecific bronchial responsiveness can be measured after two or more weeks away from work and again after workplace exposure to obtain more objective evidence of an occupational cause of symptoms and airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This testing is particularly helpful when the baseline spirometry and initial testing of nonspecific bronchial responsiveness are normal.

If bronchoprovocation testing is negative, but OA is still strongly suspected clinically, skin or immunoassay testing may provide evidence of sensitization.
