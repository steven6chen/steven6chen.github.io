Oral overdose of sustained release preparations is most commonly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As therapeutic use has declined, the frequency of serious theophylline poisoning has also decreased. Over eight years, the number of annual cases of theophylline exposure reported to American poison control centers decreased from 1395 to 347 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In the United States during the time period of 1985 to 1995, theophylline poisoning requiring hemodialysis or hemoperfusion accounted for 49 cases per one million poison center calls, versus only 6 cases per one million poison center calls from 1996 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Other indications have lower therapeutic ranges. Theophylline has a narrow clinical therapeutic index (ratio of 50 percent toxic dose to 50 percent effective dose) of 1 to 1.5. Theophylline is available as an elixir, extended release capsule, and controlled release tablet. </p><p>The intravenous form of the drug, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminophylline</a>, is a 2:1 complex of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and ethylenediamine. It contains approximately 80 percent theophylline by weight. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> metabolism, and consequently half-life, shows a wide variation as a function of age. Clearance is low at birth, increases dramatically after six months of age, peaks at age two years and then gradually falls to adult levels by age 16 years.

The magnitude of catecholamine elevation and the specific catecholamines released vary depending on the type of intoxication:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute intoxication has been shown to be associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> concentrations four to eight-fold higher than controls and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> concentrations four- to 10-fold higher than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the few patients with chronic overdose who have been studied, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> levels were elevated compared with normal patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At toxic concentrations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Phosphodiesterase inhibition increases levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate which augments beta-adrenergic effects. Adrenergic hyperstimulation results in the metabolic abnormalities frequently seen with theophylline intoxication (eg, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis). Excess catecholamines may also predispose to arrhythmias as well as contribute to hypotension through beta-adrenergic mediated vasodilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> is notable for having a low volume of distribution, high absorption, and highly variable metabolism that is altered by age, viral illness, cardiac failure, and liver disease. Chronic intoxication is typically due to theophylline&rsquo;s complicated metabolism. At levels only slightly above therapeutic range, its kinetics converts from first order to zero-order. This conversion causes small changes in either dosing or metabolism to result in large changes in serum concentration. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absorption</strong> &ndash; When taken orally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> is 80 to 100 percent absorbed and there is no significant first-pass metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein binding</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> is 50 to 65 percent protein bound in the circulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volume of distribution</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> has a relatively small volume of distribution (Vd) of 0.45 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span>. The Vd is slightly larger at the extremes of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These factors allow the clinician to accurately estimate the anticipated peak level following an acute ingestion of theophylline. For every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> ingested, the peak level is expected to rise 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span>. Similarly, since 1 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminophylline</a> is equivalent to 0.8 mg of theophylline, each 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered intravenously is anticipated to raise the serum level of theophylline 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/mL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolism</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> metabolism and half-life show a wide variation as a function of age. Clearance is low at birth, increases dramatically after six months of age, peaks at age two years, and then gradually falls to adult levels by age 16 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In newborns, 50 percent is excreted unchanged in the urine with the remainder being metabolized in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Because the mixed function oxidase system is not mature, N-methylation to caffeine is an important metabolic pathway. Caffeine accumulates in newborns on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As the mixed function oxidase system develops, approximately 90 percent is metabolized through that system by CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Changes in metabolism translate into a half-life which is a function of age. In premature infants, half-life is 30 hours, falling to 25 hours in term infants, three hours in young children, and gradually rising to an adult half-life of eight hours by age 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For all ages, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> metabolism follows Michaelis-Menten (saturable) kinetics. Over the therapeutic range, metabolism follows first order kinetics (ie, 50 percent of the drug is metabolized during one half-life). Slightly above the therapeutic range however, the kinetics shift to zero order (ie, a set amount of drug is metabolized per unit time) and small increases in theophylline dosing can lead to rapid increases in serum concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug interactions</strong> &ndash; Metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> is affected by any process which alters activity of the cytochrome oxidases CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 located in the liver. These isoenzymes have been shown to be inhibited by a wide variety of intercurrent diseases such as upper respiratory infections associated with fever as well as a large number of pharmaceuticals including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Herbal preparations (eg, St. John's Wort) have also been shown to interfere with theophylline metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Concurrent use of theophylline and a number of drugs (eg, cimetidine) has been shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, prior to prescribing a new agent to a patient who is chronically on theophylline, it is prudent to check that there is no documented inhibition of the mixed function oxidase system.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid overview provides the common clinical findings after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> poisoning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61581 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> intoxication is classified as acute or chronic.
