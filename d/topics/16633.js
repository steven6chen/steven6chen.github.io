Over the last several decades, the development of potent antisecretory agents (H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors) and the recognition that treatment for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection can eliminate most ulcer recurrences have essentially eliminated the need for elective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, complications related to peptic ulcer disease continue to occur and include bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. An understanding of surgical management remains important since surgery is the mainstay of emergency treatment of these life-threatening complications and for disease that is refractory to medical management. Also, there remain a significant number of patients who underwent surgery prior to the development of current standard medical therapies who continue to have issues related to their original operation.</p><p>The indications for surgery, general principles of ulcer surgery, and respective treatments for duodenal and gastric ulcers will be reviewed here. The technical aspects of gastrectomy and vagotomy and their complications are reviewed elsewhere.

In a study of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), hospitalizations for PUD decreased 30 percent from 1993 to 2006, with the decline being greater for duodenal compared with gastric ulcers (37 versus 20 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These declines are attributed to better medical therapy, including proton pump inhibitors and regimens that eradicate <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (<em>H. pylori</em>). The natural history and treatment of PUD are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the decrease in the hospitalization rate for PUD, surgeons-in-training now have less exposure to the overall management of PUD, including complications, as well as some of the more technically demanding procedures for treating PUD, such as highly selective vagotomy (parietal cell vagotomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Currently accepted indications, elective and emergent, for surgery in the management of peptic ulcer disease include bleeding, perforation, obstruction, intractable disease, and suspected malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5671756\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of peptic ulcer disease complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease requiring hospitalization.

In observational studies, duodenal, <span class=\"nowrap\">antral/pyloric,</span> and gastric body ulcers account for 60, 20, and 20 percent of perforations, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Most patients with acute bleeding can be managed with fluid resuscitation and transfusion, acid suppression therapy, and endoscopic intervention. For those who fail these efforts, surgery may become necessary. The specific indications for surgery for patients with bleeding peptic ulcer are reviewed separately.

Most cases are associated with duodenal or pyloric channel ulceration; gastric ulceration accounts for only 5 percent of cases.</p><p>Surgical consultation should be obtained for patients with chronic partial gastric outlet obstruction that is refractory to medical treatment and those found to have complete gastric outlet obstruction or those readmitted with gastric outlet obstruction after recent &quot;successful treatment.&quot; Surgery is indicated if the patient fails to respond to conservative medical management and endoscopic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Peptic ulcer disease'</a>.) </p><p>Surgical treatment of gastric outlet obstruction is almost never an emergency. Because most patients present with some degree of malnutrition and frequently have electrolyte imbalances (ie, hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis secondary to vomiting or nasogastric suctioning), it is important to correct any derangements and optimize the patient's medical status prior to proceeding with surgery. Failure to identify and correct these issues increases perioperative morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It may also be reasonable to try to improve the patient's overall nutritional status with nutritional support as these patients are frequently malnourished and can have significant postoperative delayed gastric emptying due to their atonic stomach.

The precise time period after which an ulcer should be considered intractable remains poorly defined. </p><p>Severe symptoms, failure to heal on medical therapy (including antimicrobials), and relapse while on maintenance therapy or after multiple courses of therapy may indicate the need for surgery. Ongoing symptoms or ulcers may indicate noncompliance with proton pump inhibitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent <em>H. pylori</em> infection, continued smoking, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use.

Specific surgical management of refractory peptic ulcer disease and complications of peptic ulcer disease are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H182351408\" class=\"local\">'Duodenal ulcer'</a> below and <a href=\"#H182352493\" class=\"local\">'Gastric ulcer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182353899\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fundamental goals of surgical therapy for peptic ulcer disease are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat or prevent ulcer complications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce acid secretion to permit ulcer healing and prevent ulcer recurrence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize postoperative sequelae related to the operation</p><p/><p>No single procedure satisfies all of these goals, nor is any one operation applicable to all clinical settings. In some respects, surgical management of peptic ulcer disease represents a compromise, with the morbidity of ulcer disease replaced by the morbidity of the operation. Thus, the least morbid procedure that will adequately manage the patient's problem should be used in each instance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111088144\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients presenting with refractory peptic ulcer disease or related complications typically undergo some type of diagnostic imaging study during the initial evaluation (eg, abdominal radiography, computed tomography, endoscopy), which may provide sufficient information to guide surgery, when it is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis may identify a mass as a cause of gastric outlet obstruction due to malignancy (eg, stomach, ampulla, pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts, or duodenum), or more unusual causes of gastric outlet obstruction, such as pancreatitis, Crohn disease, or gastric volvulus. These are important to recognize preoperatively as these findings alter surgical management. When a patient presents with gastric outlet obstruction, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should also be attempted to determine whether the obstruction is pre- or postpyloric, to attempt balloon dilatation, and to obtain a biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360424195\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical options range from local therapies that only manage ulcer-related complications (ie, bleeding, perforation, or obstruction) to definitive ulcer operations. </p><p>Definitive ulcer operations (eg, highly selective vagotomy, truncal vagotomy with gastric drainage, partial gastrectomy) aim to reduce acid secretion and hence decrease ulcer recurrence rate. However, these procedures add operative time and can be associated with increased perioperative morbidity and long-term adverse physiologic sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When choosing between local versus definitive operations, the surgeon must consider:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristics of the ulcer (location, chronicity, presence of complications) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The features of any obstruction (anatomic level, inflammation, pyloric scarring)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient (age, nutrition, comorbid illness, condition on presentation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operation (mortality rate, complications, long-term sequelae)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">His/her</span> personal experience</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360424201\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulcer bed management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulcer bed management may include ligation of bleeding vessels or the placement and fixation of omentum within the ulcer bed to cover the defect and promote healing (ie, Graham patch).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360424207\"><span class=\"h3\">Vagotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vagotomy is a procedure that transects or removes a portion of the vagus nerves or branches of the vagus nerves to decrease gastric acid secretion. Although definitive ulcer operations are no longer frequently performed, either a truncal vagotomy or a highly selective vagotomy is still considered an integral part of such procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Vagotomy for the treatment of acute peptic ulcer disease is discussed in detail separately.

Gastric drainage procedures divide or bypass the pyloric sphincter mechanism to facilitate gastric emptying (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63194 \">figure 2</a>). Pyloroplasty is generally preferred to gastrojejunostomy because the normal anatomic relationship between the stomach and duodenum is preserved. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyloroplasty is a procedure that widens the opening between the antrum and duodenum to facilitate passage of gastric contents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63194 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty, which divides the sphincter longitudinally and closes it transversely, is the simplest and most commonly performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Finney and Jaboulay pyloroplasties are gastroduodenostomies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrojejunostomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53190 \">figure 3</a>), which anastomoses the dependent portion of the stomach to the proximal jejunum, is typically reserved for patients with significant duodenal bulb scarring that precludes safe pyloroplasty. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360424234\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrectomy and reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial gastrectomy (eg, antrectomy, subtotal gastrectomy) removes the portion of the stomach containing the ulcer, the gastrin-producing cells that stimulate acid secretion, and a variable number of acid-producing parietal cells depending upon the extent of the resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89669 \">figure 4</a>). Antrectomy would not remove any parietal cells, while subtotal gastrectomy would remove some but not all parietal cells. To remove all of the gastrin-producing antral tissue, it is necessary to resect at least 35 percent of the distal stomach. The line of resection should be taken high onto the lesser curve, as antral tissue extends to within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction#H465970701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Surgical anatomy and physiology of the stomach'</a>.)</p><p>Reconstruction of the stomach is necessary following partial gastrectomy to reestablish gastrointestinal continuity. The Billroth I, Billroth II, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction techniques are the most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60974 \">figure 5</a>). Techniques for partial gastrectomy and reconstruction are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Billroth I reconstruction may be difficult to accomplish due to severe inflammation in the region around the duodenum and pylorus and is generally not advisable. If a Billroth II is selected, the gastrojejunostomy should be created to allow gravity to aid drainage. This usually requires anastomosis of the efferent limb to the greater curve of the stomach and placing the anastomosis in a dependent area on the posterior wall of the stomach. Although there are no convincing data showing any significant differences in outcomes of a retrocolic versus antecolic anastomosis, angulation of the proximal limb as it joins the lesser curvature should be minimized since excessive angulation or twisting can lead to afferent limb obstruction with potential blowout of the duodenal stump. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications#H8245464\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;, section on 'Duodenal stump leak'</a>.)</p><p>When constructing a retrocolic anastomosis, it is important to suture the mesenteric defect to the gastric wall so the afferent and efferent limbs lie inferior to the mesenteric defect. Otherwise, the limbs may be obstructed by fibrosis in the mesenteric defect and create early or late anastomotic obstruction. </p><p>Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is another option for gastric reconstruction after <span class=\"nowrap\">antrectomy/vagotomy</span> for peptic ulcer disease, but it has several disadvantages over a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. The most significant issue with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is that it exacerbates problems with gastric emptying in patients with gastric outlet obstruction, and motility problems tend to develop over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While roux limbs divert biliary and pancreatic secretions away from the stomach, this advantage does not outweigh the disadvantage of poor drainage, and, thus, it should not be the preferred method of reconstruction for patients undergoing partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction#H182355576\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Choice of reconstruction'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182353749\"><span class=\"h2\">Open versus laparoscopic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the procedures described above can be performed laparoscopically, and experience with laparoscopic techniques for managing peptic ulcer disease is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>].

In our practice, we use pyloric exclusion selectively when the risk of a large duodenal leak is high, when the degree of inflammation is severe, or when either the overall health of the patient or the quality of local tissue is poor, rather than in all patients.</p><p>Definitive ulcer surgery with an acid-reducing procedure may be desirable in patients with perforation, especially when the perforation is close to the pylorus, and in patients for whom the risk of recurrent complications cannot be reliably reduced (such as rare patients who will require continued use of an NSAID or those who are likely to resume NSAID use against medical advice). Most large studies of patients who have undergone definitive ulcer surgery were performed prior to the recognition of the role of <em>H. pylori</em> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/38,40,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40,49-51</a>].

The perioperative mortality was 5.5 percent, ulcers recurred in 8.8 percent, and postoperative digestive sequelae, notably diarrhea and dumping, developed in 16 percent. Nevertheless, the overall results were considered to be good to excellent in almost 90 percent of survivors. Similar recurrence rates (but with less morbidity) have been described in patients who underwent highly selective vagotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360425451\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric outlet obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation from peptic ulcer disease, especially a pyloric channel or duodenal ulceration, causes edema and duodenal spasm and is the most common cause of benign gastric outlet obstruction. Acute inflammation may respond to medical management or progress to chronic inflammation. Endoscopic balloon dilation may transiently relieve gastric outlet obstruction, but repeated balloon dilatation is associated with risks such as perforation, which can complicate future surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Thus, for a subgroup of patients, surgical management of gastric outlet obstruction may become essential for the long-term relief of symptoms.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagotomy#H532042971\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vagotomy&quot;, section on 'Gastric outlet obstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Vagotomy and drainage is an alternative to <span class=\"nowrap\">antrectomy/distal</span> gastrectomy. In a randomized trial that included 90 consecutive patients with gastric outlet obstruction secondary to duodenal ulcer, there were no differences in the postoperative course or the reduction in gastric acid secretion in patients assigned to vagotomy and antrectomy compared with vagotomy and drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Surgery can be challenging because of inflammation and scarring in the pyloric region that may extend into the porta hepatis. Inflammation in this region can result in distorted anatomy and lead to potential difficulties in securely closing the duodenal stump following antrectomy.<strong> </strong>Because the fibrotic process may alter the usual anatomic relationships, critical vascular structures and the common bile duct may be nearer to the duodenal stump than anticipated and difficult to identify. For these reasons, antrectomy may be a less suitable choice.</p><p>When vagotomy and drainage are chosen, debate persists as to the optimal drainage procedure. Patients whose ulcer disease is severe enough to create obstruction rarely have a duodenum that is pliable enough to permit a pyloroplasty. In those rare instances where fibrosis is minimal or confined only to a small area, a Finney pyloroplasty may be an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, foreshortening of the first part of the duodenum may make a Jaboulay pyloroplasty (latero-lateral duodenoduodenostomy) a better alternative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63194 \">figure 2</a>). The Jaboulay has gained popularity because of its technical simplicity and because the anastomosis is performed in healthy tissue, away from the ulcer bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, the randomized trial mentioned above suggested that gastrojejunostomy may be better than a Jaboulay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If the duodenal stump is difficult, a posterior gastrojejunostomy without antrectomy should provide adequate drainage and should preferably include biopsy of the ulcer. Although gastrojejunostomy may theoretically reduce some of the advantages of highly selective vagotomy, vagotomy should nonetheless be considered.

The most important is that gastric ulcer may harbor malignancy, and, therefore, the ulcer must be excised or, at a minimum, generously biopsied. In addition, patients with gastric ulcer tend to be an older and more debilitated population, increasing the risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality.

These occur along the lesser curvature near the junction of fundic and antral mucosa and occur in the setting of acid hyposecretion.</p><p>For most patients with type I gastric ulcer, distal gastrectomy with Billroth I or Billroth II reconstruction is recommended since this approach removes the ulcer and the diseased antrum. It also treats an occult malignancy. Recurrent ulcer rates are low (0 to 5 percent), and excellent symptomatic relief is usually achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

In a retrospective review of 349 cases of gastric ulcer at the Cleveland Clinic from 1950 to 1979, no significant differences were found in recurrence rates for gastric resection with or without vagotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Median follow-up was more than 11 years. This study also found comparable results for truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty plus ulcer excision or biopsy. Thus, vagotomy is not absolutely necessary but not unreasonable for type I gastric ulcer.</p><p>Although most prefer distal gastrectomy, highly selective vagotomy has been used for type I gastric ulcer. The value of highly selective vagotomy in gastric ulcer may derive from its ability to decrease acid secretion while maintaining adequate gastric emptying and minimizing postoperative duodenogastric reflux. The procedure is performed as for duodenal ulcer, with the addition of a gastrotomy to resect or biopsy the ulcer bed. This approach has been questioned on theoretical grounds because highly selective vagotomy may promote a degree of gastric stasis and gastrin hypersecretion, two factors hypothesized to contribute to gastric ulcer pathogenesis. Despite these concerns, clinical results have been promising. In one series of 48 patients, the ulcer recurrence rate was comparable to gastrectomy at 6.5 percent with few adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Ulcer diameter and location may make this highly selective vagotomy difficult for some patients in whom ulcer-induced inflammation, edema, or scarring may obscure accurate dissection of the vagus nerves along the lesser curvature of the stomach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182352520\"><span class=\"h3\">Type II gastric ulcer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type II gastric ulcers occur synchronously with scarring or ulceration in the duodenum or pyloric channel.

Large ulcer diameter, the degree of surrounding inflammation, and proximity to the gastroesophageal junction render operative management difficult and potentially dangerous. If the integrity of the distal esophagus can be assured, subtotal gastric resection (including the ulcer bed) is considered optimal therapy. Typically, an attempt is made to preserve a margin of unaffected stomach to facilitate the anastomosis. Alternatives include the Pauchet procedure, which is a distal gastrectomy extended along the lesser curvature to include the ulcer, or the Kelly-Madlener procedure, in which distal gastrectomy is performed but the ulcer is left in place to avoid compromise of the gastroesophageal junction. Although there is no consensus in the literature, many surgeons feel more comfortable performing an esophageal anastomosis knowing that the ulcer is removed. When most of the stomach is removed, a Roux-en-Y reconstruction if often performed.

(See <a href=\"#H360425102\" class=\"local\">'Elective surgery for duodenal ulcer'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with duodenal bleeding or perforation related to peptic ulcer disease who have received a fully adequate trial of medical management, we suggest performing a definitive acid-reducing procedure in addition to managing the ulcer bed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). When choosing to add an acid-reducing procedure, we suggest truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty, rather than another acid-reducing procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Managing the ulcer bed alone is appropriate to control bleeding in hemodynamically unstable patients and for managing ulcer complications in those with significant comorbidities that limit life expectancy. (See <a href=\"#H360425204\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding duodenal ulcer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The extent of gastric resection for gastric ulcer, which may harbor malignancy, depends upon the size and location of the ulcer. For uncomplicated or complicated gastric ulcer, we suggest partial gastrectomy and reconstruction rather than simple ulcer excision in good-risk surgical candidates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with significant medical comorbidities, alternatives include ulcer excision for bleeding or patch closure for perforation, possibly combined with vagotomy and gastric drainage. (See <a href=\"#H182352493\" class=\"local\">'Gastric ulcer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastric outlet obstruction is the least frequent complication of peptic ulcer disease, and most cases of gastric outlet obstruction are associated with duodenal or pyloric channel ulceration, but the potential for malignancy must be taken into account. Thus, for patients with gastric outlet obstruction complicating peptic ulcer disease and no major medical comorbidities, we suggest distal gastrectomy rather than another definitive acid-reducing procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with significant risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality, a drainage procedure, such as gastrojejunostomy, is an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H360425451\" class=\"local\">'Gastric outlet obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kauffman GL Jr. Duodenal ulcer disease: treatment by surgery, antibiotics, or both.
