Two types of cryoprecipitates are recognized. Cryoglobulin (CG) is present when proteins precipitate from an individual's serum and plasma, and cryofibrinogen refers to the precipitate from plasma only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>CGs are either immunoglobulins or a mixture of immunoglobulins and complement components. The nature of CGs, an overview of the clinical syndromes associated with them (cryoglobulinemia, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis), their pathogenesis, associated disorders, and prognosis are the subjects of this topic review. Treatment of cryoglobulinemia due to plasma cell disorders (monoclonal CG) and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemic syndromes, such as those associated with hepatitis C infection, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, a precipitate that develops in refrigerated plasma (cryofibrinogen) is typically composed of a mixture of fibrinogen, fibrin, fibronectin, and fibrin split products. The clinical manifestations of cryofibrinogenemia and disorders associated with the presence of circulating cryofibrinogen are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryofibrinogenemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryofibrinogenemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOGLOBULIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoglobulin (CG) consists of immunoglobulins and complement components and precipitates upon refrigeration of serum and plasma. Routine laboratory testing for CG is, however, typically performed only on serum. The first description of the cryoprecipitation phenomenon has been attributed to Wintrobe and Buell, who described in 1933 a patient with signs and symptoms of hyperviscosity associated with multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 1947, the term &quot;cryoglobulin&quot; was applied to this &quot;cold precipitable serum globulin&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The appearance of precipitated CGs is illustrated in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82774\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82774 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOGLOBULINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although, strictly speaking, cryoglobulinemia refers to the presence of cryoglobulin (CG) in a patient's serum, this term is often used to refer to a systemic inflammatory syndrome that generally involves small-to-medium vessel vasculitis due to CG-containing immune complexes. The terms &quot;cryoglobulinemic syndrome&quot; and &quot;cryoglobulinemic vasculitis&quot; are sometimes used to make a distinction between the clinically apparent disorder and the asymptomatic presence of CGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>While the phenomenon of cryoprecipitation and associated hyperviscosity was described in the 1930s, the association of CG with the triad of palpable purpura, arthralgia, and myalgia was not described until the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. It is important to note that these two different, yet highly representative, clinical syndromes generally reflect different types of underlying CG:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperviscosity is typically associated with CG due to hematological malignancies and monoclonal immunoglobulins.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Meltzer's triad&quot; of palpable purpura, arthralgia, and myalgia is generally seen with polyclonal CGs seen in essential-, viral-, or connective tissue disease-associated CG.</p><p/><p>Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia was the traditional term for idiopathic vasculitis caused by circulating CGs that contain both a polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and an IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) directed against the IgG, which are called mixed CGs. In most patients, this disorder is associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.</p><p>A more accurate term for this type of vasculitis is the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome, which refers to primary or idiopathic cryoglobulinemia as well as cryoglobulinemia associated with autoimmune diseases, malignancy, or infection. The mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome can be caused by either type II or type III CGs, the characteristics of which are defined below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Brouet classification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of clinically-significant cryoglobulinemia has been estimated at approximately 1 in 100,000, although detectable levels of circulating CGs have been seen in a significant proportion of patients with chronic infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation: 15 to 20 percent in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 15 to 25 percent in connective tissue diseases, 40 to 65 percent in hepatitis C-infected individuals, and as high as 64 percent in HIV and hepatitis C coinfection, perhaps especially among patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p>Thus, once the presence of CG has been demonstrated, further characterization of the CG may be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An approach to the classification of the major forms of cryoglobulinemia is described below. Preliminary classification criteria have been proposed for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Analysis of cryoglobulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to analyze the nature of the cryoglobulin (CG), it must be redissolved by warming and subjected to laboratory testing to determine its immunoglobulin (Ig) and complement components. This is accomplished by performing immunofixation of the redissolved CG against antibodies directed to various Ig heavy chains (IgG, IgM, etc) and light chains (eg, kappa and lambda) and to complement components (eg, C1q, C4, and C3) or similar immunological analyses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Brouet classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One frequently used classification scheme for cryoglobulinemia is that of Brouet, which uses the immunological analysis of the CG to delineate the clonality of the responsible CG, particularly with regard to rheumatoid factor (RF) binding activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51371 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type I</strong> &ndash; The presence of isolated monoclonal Ig (typically IgG or IgM, less commonly IgA or free immunoglobulin light chains) is the criterion for classification as a type I CG. The proportion of patients with a type I CG varies substantially among case series but accounts for about 5 to 25 percent of cases. The hematologic diagnoses are typically Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type II</strong> &ndash; A mixture of polyclonal Ig in association with a monoclonal Ig typically IgM or IgA, with RF activity defines type II CG. Type II CGs are often due to persistent viral infections, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, and are associated with the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type III</strong> &ndash; Mixed CGs consisting of polyclonal Ig without a monoclonal Ig component characterize type III CGs. These cases are often secondary to autoimmune disorders, but can also be associated with infections (mainly HCV).</p><p/><p>While generally useful, this schema does not account for CGs that possess atypical characteristics, such as oligoclonal IgM components with or without trace polyclonal Ig responses, often referred to as type II-III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], or biclonal CGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Many speculate that such phenomena reflect an intermediate stage of transition between II and III, akin to the malignant transformation of monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma or other lymphoproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], but a direct pathogenic link has not been clearly demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to classification by the immunoglobulin constituents of the CG, CG syndromes are often classified as idiopathic or secondary, based upon the presence of underlying diseases, particularly chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or connective tissue diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77121%7ERHEUM%2F52034\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77121 graphicRef52034 \">table 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>At the same time, the clinical features of both idiopathic and secondary CG overlap somewhat, with respect to Brouet subtype and organ involvement, making most distinctions among CG syndromes somewhat difficult to interpret consistently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since minute levels of cryoglobulin (CG) are often detectable in the serum of healthy persons, many researchers have speculated that they reflect the ongoing physiological clearance of endogenous immune complexes by immunoglobulins (Ig) with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. In such a scenario, pathogenic CG responses would result from several factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic immune stimulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphoproliferation, resulting in the production of higher concentrations of mono-, oligo-, or polyclonal CG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune complex formation among CGs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their target antigens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defective <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insufficient clearance of the resulting immune complexes, which accumulate and mediate disease</p><p/><p>CG pathogenesis may depend upon a poorly understood interaction between a polygenic host predisposition and environmental triggers, but specifically responsible genes remain unidentified. Major histocompatibility complex associations, for instance, have been extensively investigated, but with inconsistent findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia, particularly significantly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, have been observed, suggesting a particular role for CG-induced inflammation in disease pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV coinfection are relatively common, the combination of the two viral agents appears to have little or no effect upon the prevalence of CG or symptomatic CG syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other infectious agents proposed, but not proven, to have an association with cryoglobulinemia include hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human parvovirus B19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Type I CG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I cryoglobulinemia causes hyperviscosity that results from high levels of monoclonal CG due to an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. These Ig form cold-induced precipitates. In vivo, such aggregates may physically obstruct vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediate inflammatory vasculitis via immune complex deposition (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Pathological findings'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], as suggested by studies of human CGs in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For many CGs, aggregation and pathogenicity appear to depend upon antibody-specific conditions of temperature, pH, CG concentration, and weak noncovalent factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Types II and III CG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mixed CGs (types II and III) generally result from chronic inflammatory states, such as connective tissue diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus or Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, or viral infections, such as HCV, although lymphoproliferative disorders have rarely been associated as well. Many of these disease states share B-cell hyperactivation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperproliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/13,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30</a>], which seem to predispose to the selective expansion of CG-producing B-cell clone(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], but a precise ontology of pathogenic CGs in mixed CG has not been delineated. This paradigm of pathogenesis has been most intensively studied for chronic HCV infection, in which B-cell hyperactivation may result upon direct infection via the cell surface protein CD81 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], via chronic, antigen-nonspecific stimulation by macromolecular serum complexes containing HCV, including HCV-IgG and HCV-lipoprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], or via an HCV antigen-specific mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], resulting in expansion of specific B-cell clones such as those expressing the WA idiotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] or V(H)1-69 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. HCV particles are often found in such patients' serum CG complexes, but, at the same time, CG development in hepatitis C infection does not directly require the HCV virion or its components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this sense, CG development may, in fact, reflect a normal, expected response to regulate immune complexes in states of chronic immune activation.</p><p>Among patients with HCV infection, the number of circulating T cells with surface markers compatible with a suppressor phenotype may be a feature that differs between patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and those with asymptomatic CG. This was illustrated in a study that compared the percentage of &quot;regulatory&quot; T cells in 69 patients with HCV infection who had symptomatic CG with others with asymptomatic HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The mean levels of regulatory T cells were significantly lower in those with symptomatic HCV-associated CG than asymptomatic subjects (2.6 versus 7.4 percent, respectively). Whether the diminished proportion of regulatory T cells plays a role in causing vasculitis is uncertain but warrants further exploration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Aggregation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The molecular characteristics of CG similarly vary, depending upon the underlying disease state. Most commonly, type II CGs contain germline autoantibodies with RF activity, suggesting an antigen-independent, hyperproliferative etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/33,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,40</a>]. Nevertheless, non-RF CGs have been described, mostly in type I responses, in which cryoprecipitability seems to be mediated by other characteristics of the Ig molecule itself, such as the absence of sialic acid moieties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Furthermore, specific factors may be required within the IgG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> target antigen(s) of the CG, especially in the mixed cryoglobulinemias, since many cryoprecipitates best form between the CG in association with the respective patient's IgG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its Fc, not with IgG from normal serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These findings suggest that CGs result from the specific selection of antibodies with such characteristics by the pathological processes responsible for CG development, rather than emerging from a random, stochastic process.</p><p>Classically, the overproduction of CG and the resulting aggregates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune complexes are thought to overwhelm normal mononuclear phagocyte system activity, perhaps by impairing normal Fc receptor function, leading to the accumulation of serum CG complexes which induce disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Indeed, some familial forms of CG have been associated with deficiencies in complement proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>] and presumably result from the inability of these patients to effectively clear CG-containing immune complexes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical presentations of cryoglobulin (CG) syndromes vary substantially among some series, probably due in large part to both differences of case definition and prevalence of secondary etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51371 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Most investigators agree that the majority of people with CG are asymptomatic. When a clinically significant disorder is associated with the presence of CGs, the symptoms and physical findings are generally correlated with the underlying Brouet type of CG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Type I CG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with detectable type I CG are asymptomatic. Type I CG classically produces signs related to hyperviscosity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis: Raynaud phenomenon, digital ischemia, livedo reticularis, and purpura may occur. In severe cases, without treatment, this may progress to gangrene.</p><p>Neurologic symptoms due to hyperviscosity include blurring or loss of vision, headache, vertigo, nystagmus, dizziness, sudden deafness, diplopia, ataxia, confusion, dementia, disturbances of consciousness, stroke, or coma. The epidemiology and prognosis of type I CG has largely reflected the usually underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, such as Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma.

All patients had either a hematologic malignancy (most often Waldenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma) or a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (56 and 44 percent, respectively). Cutaneous involvement, sometimes severe and resulting in ulcerations and necrosis, was often present; other common findings included peripheral neuropathy, as well as arthralgia or arthritis. Renal disease (usually a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis) was seen in 30 percent of the affected patients. None of the patients exhibited central nervous system, pulmonary, cardiac, or gastrointestinal manifestations. Treatment for these symptoms included glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, alkylating agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and other chemotherapy; 10 percent of the patients did not require treatment. Ten-year survival was 87 percent, with relatively poorer survival rates in the patients with hematologic malignancy. Another report of a series of patients with symptomatic type I CG and multiple myeloma noted the benefit of therapies that included drug regimens directed at the myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Nevertheless, the classical &quot;Meltzer's triad&quot; of purpura, arthralgias, and weakness is seen in as few as 25 to 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>].

Similarly, Raynaud phenomenon, livedo reticularis, and acrocyanosis more commonly manifest in type I CG. Lesions sometimes appear on the head, neck, and mucosal surfaces, but again this distribution is more commonly seen in type I CG. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (30 to 50 percent) and exacerbation as a result of cold exposure (10 to 30 percent) are common.

Arthralgias are typically described in over 70 percent of patients, especially affecting the metacarpophalangeal, proximal phalangeal, knees, and ankles, often in type III CG and often exacerbated by cold exposure.

For each, various pathologies have been speculated upon but not fully explored; for example, many consider hepatomegaly to represent evidence of chronic hepatitis or other liver disease or consider abdominal pain to reflect active mesenteric vasculitis. Clinically significant vasculitis of most other internal organs, such as of the heart, central nervous system, and retinal vessels, rarely complicates any of the cryoglobulinemic syndromes with the possible exception of those with hyperviscosity due to type I CG.

Type I CG typically produces few serological complement abnormalities, but mixed CG sera often demonstrate reduced levels of total hemolytic complement (CH50) and early complement proteins C1q, C2, and C4, particularly in type II CG as well as in type III CG associated with collagen-vascular disease. Levels of C3 are generally unaffected or only mildly diminished. Late complement components are also usually insignificantly affected, although modest elevations have been reported. Abnormalities of early complement proteins also occur in many other medical conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus or some infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute phase reactants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests appear to reflect a chronic inflammatory response.

Blood viscosity is mildly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>], and a mild normochromic, normocytic anemia is often detectable. False positive test results for antibodies to citrullinated peptide antigens (ACPA) in a small proportion of patients with hepatitis C-related CG (7 percent) have been ascribed to nonspecific binding of Ig in the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

These precautions are required because failure to prewarm may lead to false-negative results, due to loss of the CG in the clotted blood (eg, if there is cooling below 37&ordm;C during collection, clotting, or centrifugation), and because the presence of anticoagulants may produce false-positive results due to the formation of cryofibrinogen or heparin-precipitable complexes.</p><p>After clotting at 37&ordm;C for one-half to one hour, the serum is separated by centrifugation at 37&ordm;C, is placed in a graduated (Wintrobe) tube, and is refrigerated (4&ordm;C) to allow the precipitation of CG. In type I CG, precipitates are often seen within 24 hours (sometimes in less than 90 minutes). However, three to five days are usually allowed for complete precipitation, especially for the mixed CGs, and some type II and type III CGs require up to seven days for precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Most laboratories will determine a cryocrit, which is a measure of the packed (centrifuged) volume of the precipitate as a percentage of the original serum volume at 4&ordm;C.</p><p>Further confidence in the cryocrit as reflecting true CG is obtained by washing the precipitate three to six times in cold saline solution to reduce the possibility of precipitated salts or other proteins. In addition, the precipitate can then be redissolved in saline at 37&ordm;C to confirm the warm solubility of the CGs. At this time, CG protein concentration can be determined by spectrophotometry. Further characterization can be accomplished by immunofixation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or another specific immunological assay.</p><p>Some laboratories perform further testing consisting of a measurement of absolute CG concentration, along with a description of the components of the immune complexes, including mono- or polyclonality of immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, IgA, IgE, kappa, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lambda light chains.

The cryocrit is generally between 2 and 7 percent in type II and between 1 and 3 percent in type III disease, but there is a poor correlation between the cryocrit and clinical symptoms and features. For example, only a small proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and type II or III CG have the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome with vasculitis or purpura, while, in some patients with the syndrome, CG may be difficult to detect.

While there is no consensus, the following are criteria that seem generally acceptable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of a persistently elevated cryocrit, such as greater than 1 percent for three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]</p><p/><p>Plus one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical indicators of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis or thrombosis, such as lower extremity purpura, particularly with evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis on biopsy or diminished serum C4 concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct evidence of CGs from pathological thrombotic or vasculitic specimens, such as by elution and cryoprecipitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunofixation. While this direct demonstration of CG may provide the most definitive evidence, it is rarely sought in clinical practice, which is consistent with the classification criteria for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis proposed by the Italian Study Group on Cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Still, in the absence of firm evidence, the clinician is often left with nonspecific symptoms, such as weakness or arthralgias, and the presence of serum CG upon which to make a diagnosis. Here, evidence of a frequently associated disorder, such as HCV infection or a clinically evident systemic disease (eg, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome) may make the diagnosis more secure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis (DDX)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia varies depending upon the clinical presentation. The following discussion deals with the most frequent scenarios.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h3\">DDX: Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis includes other vasculitides that affect small or medium-sized vessels; these include drug-induced small vessel vasculitis (hypersensitivity vasculitis), immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener&rsquo;s], microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Churg Strauss syndrome]), infection-related vasculitis (eg, bacterial endocarditis, poststreptococcal vasculitis and glomerulonephritis), and vasculitis associated with a connective tissue disorder (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome). In addition, disorders that mimic the symptoms and findings of vasculitis, including infectious (eg, Rickettsial infections, malaria, Babesiosis), thrombotic, and embolic disorders (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, atrial myxoma), may warrant consideration. The differential diagnosis of vasculitis is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h3\">DDX: Cryoglobulinemic hyperviscosity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slow flow and impaired tissue perfusion affecting many organs may be due to marked elevation of the cellular contents of the blood (eg, leukostasis, polycythemia), partial obstruction by sickled red blood cells, parasitized cells (eg, malaria, Babesiosis), or increased viscosity due to polyclonal or monoclonal immunoglobulins that are not CGs (eg, Waldenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s hyperglobulinemic purpura and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of CG per se does not seem to confer a significant morbidity or mortality risk over and above the underlying conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mean survival is approximately 70 percent at 10 years after the onset of symptoms and 50 percent at 10 years after diagnosis, with death typically resulting from infection and cardiovascular disease. Liver failure remains a large concern, but the historical correlation likely relates to the underlying activity of chronic hepatitis C infection, which often coexists in CG patients. The prognosis for such patients depends upon their response to treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;</a>). Some complications of CG predict poorer outcomes, including renal failure and development of a lymphoproliferative or plasma cell disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of development of renal failure may be greater in those with hepatitis C associated-disease than in those with idiopathic (essential) mixed cryoglobulinemia. This was illustrated in one study of 17 patients, 11 of whom had hepatitis C infection; 5 of 11 of these patients developed renal failure, while none of the 6 patients free of infection had progressive renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

The malignancy is often a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, approximately 50 percent intermediate-to-high grade lymphoma and approximately 50 percent low-grade tumors such as immunocytoma (70 to 80 percent), mucosa-associated lymphoid tumors, or centrocytic follicular lymphoma.</p><p>Among patients with hepatitis C-associated type II cryoglobulinemia, the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is estimated to be 35-fold higher than in the general population. The distribution of aggressive and nonaggressive histologic types is similar to that noted above for unselected patients with cryoglobulinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, prognosis generally relates to the underlying disease state(s) or developing complication(s), especially in type I CG where the patient often suffers from a primary lymphoproliferative disorder. Several studies have suggested that a handful of findings suggests poorer outcomes (ie, age, gastrointestinal or pulmonary involvement, renal insufficiency, four or more extrarenal manifestations, hypertension, and infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/15,52,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,52,102</a>]), but little is known about the relative contributions of each.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of cryoglobulinemia depends upon the underlying disorder and upon the severity and nature of involvement. In patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, the treatment is directed at the underlying infectious or autoimmune disorder, as well as the vasculitis that may occur. In patients with monoclonal (type 1) cryoglobulin (CG) associated with a lymphoproliferative disorder, the treatment is focused on the underlying malignancy and the risk or presence of complications such as hyperviscosity syndrome. Some patients with hyperviscosity may require treatment with plasma exchange. Treatment of cryoglobulinemia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several case reports have described the management of cryoglobulinemia in individual patients during pregnancy or in the neonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/103-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5780053\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoglobulin (CG) consists of immunoglobulins (Ig) and complement components and precipitates upon refrigeration of serum. The term cryoglobulinemia is often used to refer to a systemic inflammatory syndrome that generally involves small to medium vessel vasculitis due to CG-containing immune complexes. Hyperviscosity is typically associated with CG due to hematological malignancies and monoclonal Ig, while &quot;Meltzer's triad&quot; of palpable purpura, arthralgia, and myalgia is generally seen with polyclonal CGs present in essential, viral, or systemic rheumatic disease-associated CG. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cryoglobulin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cryoglobulinemia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Brouet classification uses the immunological analysis of the CG to delineate the clonality of the responsible CG, particularly with regard to rheumatoid factor (RF) binding activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51371 \">table 1</a>). Type I CG (5 to 25 percent of CG), in which an isolated monoclonal Ig (typically IgG or IgM) is present, is usually associated with a hematologic malignancy such as Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma. In type II CG (40 to 60 percent of CG), there is a mixture of polyclonal Ig in association with a monoclonal Ig, typically IgM or IgA, with RF activity. This type of CG, often associated with the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome, is often due to persistent viral infections, particularly hepatitic C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Mixed CG consisting of polyclonal Ig characterizes type III CGs (40 to 50 percent of CG), which are often secondary to systemic rheumatic diseases. CG syndromes are often classified as idiopathic or secondary, based upon the presence of underlying diseases. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Analysis of cryoglobulin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Brouet classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minute levels of CG are sometimes detectable in the serum of healthy persons, which may reflect the ongoing physiological clearance of endogenous immune complexes by Ig with RF activity. Pathogenic CG responses may result from factors, including chronic immune stimulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphoproliferation, which result in the production of higher concentrations of mono-, oligo-, or polyclonal CG; immune complex formation among CG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their target antigens; and defective <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insufficient clearance of the resulting immune complexes, which accumulate and mediate disease. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Aggregation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of people with CG are asymptomatic. The symptoms and physical findings are generally correlated with the underlying CG type when a clinically significant disorder is associated with the CGs. Cutaneous manifestations occur in most patients. Type I CG is often asymptomatic but also classically produces signs related to hyperviscosity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis, such as Raynaud phenomenon, digital ischemia, livedo reticularis, purpura, and neurologic symptoms.<strong> </strong>By contrast, mixed CGs most often produce constitutional and nonspecific symptoms, such as arthralgias, fatigue, and myalgias, as well as palpable purpura due to cutaneous vasculitis and sensory changes or weakness due to peripheral neuropathy. Pulmonary manifestations, often subclinical, may occur. Immune complex renal disease may occur in mixed CG; less often, thrombotic disease may occur in patients with type I CG. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I CG predominantly affects the skin, kidney, and bone marrow, and mixed CG (types II and III) predominantly involves the skin, peripheral nervous system, and kidney. Autopsy studies of mixed CG have revealed extensive, yet often clinically inapparent, vasculitis in additional sites. A common feature at involved sites in skin, muscle, lung, and kidney is the presence of eosinophilic material within the lumen of small vessels; these deposits often extend into the intimal region and are associated with inflammation of the vessel wall. Pathologic findings, such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis or immune-complex related injury, vary with the type of CG and the involved site. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Pathological findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a measurable amount of CG (cryocrit) remains the most prominent laboratory hallmark of CG syndromes. Several other serological findings have often been reported, but none are pathognomonic, since they often are encountered in normal individuals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other confounding medical conditions. These include decreased levels of complement, elevated acute phase reactants, autoantibodies, and positive viral serologies. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CG syndromes rests principally in the laboratory demonstration of serum CGs in association with characteristic clinical signs and symptoms (eg, vasculitic syndromes versus disorders associated with hyperviscosity). (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis (DDX)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To detect CG, 10 to 20 mL of blood are drawn into syringes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> collection tubes that have been prewarmed to 37&ordm;C without anticoagulants. After clotting at 37&ordm;C for one-half to one hour, the serum is separated by centrifugation at 37&ordm;C, is placed in a graduated (Wintrobe) tube, and is refrigerated (4&ordm;C) for three to five days to allow for complete precipitation of CG. A cryocrit is then determined by measuring the packed (centrifuged) volume of the precipitate as a percentage of the original serum volume at 4&ordm;C. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Detection and analysis of cryoglobulins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of CG per se does not seem to confer a significant morbidity or mortality risk over and above the underlying conditions; prognosis generally relates to the underlying disease state. Some complications of CG predict poorer outcomes, however, including renal failure and development of a lymphoproliferative or plasma cell disorder.
