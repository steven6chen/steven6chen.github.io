Prostate cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths for men in 29 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The most important known risk factors for prostate cancer are age, ethnicity, and inherited genetic variants. The genetic risk factors for adenocarcinoma of the prostate are reviewed here. Other risk factors for prostate cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3668269419\"><span class=\"h1\">HERITABLE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate cancer has a strong genetic component. However, identifying specific genes that underlie the disease is challenging. </p><p>Evidence supporting the role of genetic factors comes from studies of relatives of patients with prostate cancer (linkage studies), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), patients from families with inherited mutations in known cancer predisposition genes (such as <em>BRCA2</em> and <em>BRCA1)</em>, and next-generation sequencing studies in men with metastatic prostate cancer. This observation, coupled with an association with more aggressive features, may contribute to strategies for the early detection, diagnosis, and management of prostate cancer in the context of certain deleterious variants (for example, in <em>BRCA2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Contemporary studies have found a much higher prevalence of known inherited cancer predisposition genes (eg, <em>BRCA2</em>) than previously appreciated in men with aggressive prostate cancer. This observation may contribute to strategies for the early detection, diagnosis, and management. </p><p>Heritable factors contributing to genetic risk can be divided into two main categories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare deleterious variants, often termed mutations, interrupt the function of a known gene. In general, deleterious variants, such as those in <em>BRCA2</em>, are uncommon in the population but are associated with a high lifetime risk of cancer (high penetrance).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More common variants, classified as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may be present within the regulatory or protein-coding regions of a gene or in intra- or intergenic regions of DNA. These SNPs may directly influence the regulation or function of the gene containing the variant, or the SNP may associate with or regulate a nearby or distant gene(s) that has yet to be directly implicated in the disease. SNPs are relatively common, with allele frequencies of 1 to 5 percent in the population, but confer very modest increases in risk.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1737667014\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL FOR GENETIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed personal and family cancer history (in first- and second-degree relatives), including the type of cancer, age at diagnosis, and ancestry, may help identify individuals who may carry <em>BRCA2</em> or other prostate cancer-associated mutations. If family history suggests this possibility, patients should be referred for genetic counseling for discussion and shared decision-making about genetic testing, as appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116321 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) <span class=\"nowrap\">Genetic/Familial</span> High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian, v1.2018 now recommend that genetic counseling and testing be considered for individuals with personal history of metastatic prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Genetic screening is complex, and the potential benefits should be weighed against the potential negative aspects including psychosocial consequences, disclosure to family members, and genetic discrimination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Ethical, legal, and psychosocial issues'</a>.)</p><p>This stems from findings of a high frequency of deleterious germline mutations in DNA repair genes in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The identification of a germline mutation in <em>BRCA2</em> or other DNA repair genes may have implications for treatment in men with metastatic prostate cancer, as clinically significant responses to platinum-based chemotherapy have been reported in this setting. Furthermore, phase II clinical trials of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have also demonstrated responses in men with germline or somatic mutations in <em>BRCA2, BRCA1</em>, and <em>ATM</em>, although clinical approval for these agents in prostate cancer awaits confirmation of benefit in phase III clinical studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer#H124033439\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational approaches for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'PARP inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>Two consensus conferences addressed emerging areas in genetic counseling and genetic testing for prostate cancer: the St. Gallen Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the Philadelphia Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Both consensus statements endorsed adequate pretest and post-test genetic counseling for men with prostate cancer considering genetic testing. An emerging group of patients are those undergoing <span class=\"nowrap\">somatic/tumor</span> genomic sequencing for treatment decision-making (ie, for clinical trial consideration) and whose results suggest the potential for inherited cancer predisposition. These patients should be counseled before tumor sequencing about the possibility of uncovering germline findings, and should be referred to genetic counseling for discussion about dedicated, confirmatory germline genetic testing. &#160;</p><p>Referral for genetic counseling by a specialist is important so that patients are educated about basic cancer genetics and inheritance principles, options for genetic testing, and the potential outcomes of testing. In addition, prior to germline genetic testing, counseling should provide information with respect to the benefits, risks, and limitations of testing, reproductive and financial implications, and potential further testing of family members (cascade testing).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H776830937\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING IMPLICATIONS OF INCREASED GENETIC RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is variation in the recommendations for prostate cancer screening in men at increased risk due to family history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> known <em>BRCA1 </em>and <em>BRCA2</em> mutations. </p><p>For example, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggests that men with inherited mutations begin screening for prostate cancer prior to age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend that the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening be discussed at age 40 in this high-risk group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>We advise participating in a clinical trial of early detection, if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The IMPACT study (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT00261456&Search=Search&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPMVo4pfkVf4L/YCz0DtHAkeoWx2AK/v5yvqriEZOlaz4f68RhJUy7fVyqqVhZIZi7A=&amp;TOPIC_ID=112282\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT00261456</a>) is looking at the feasibility and role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in men who are carriers of either <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2 </em>mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. The initial screening round of the study included 1520 men who carried pathogenic mutations in either <em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>, as well as 959 controls who tested negative for the pathogenic&nbsp;<em>BRCA</em>&nbsp;mutation in their family. The mean age at study enrollment was 54 years.</p><p>Men were referred for consideration of biopsy based upon a criterion of PSA <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;3&nbsp;ng/mL</span>. At the baseline screening, 199 men (8 percent) were referred for biopsy. Prostate cancer was detected in 59 cases (2.4 percent of the entire cohort), and 75 percent of these had intermediate- or high-risk disease. While not statistically significant, the positive predictive value was higher for <em>BRCA2</em> carriers than for controls (48 versus 33 percent) and higher for <em>BRCA1</em> carriers than for controls (37 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Final results are anticipated.</p><p>Importantly, not all genes involved in DNA repair and not all mutations in a given gene are expected to confer the same level of risk for the development of prostate cancer. To date, the most mature data are available for <em>BRCA2</em> with respect to lifetime risk for the development of prostate cancer as well as adverse outcomes that are associated with a mutation. For other genes, limited information is available, and consequently, recommendations for screening and treatment await further studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3432679009\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3776727171\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of genetic factors is illustrated by two large contemporary studies that have studied the impact of a positive family history on the risk of developing prostate cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnitude of increased risk was illustrated by a study from the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) that compared the risk of prostate cancer in 51,897 men who were brothers of 32,807 index cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The overall risk of developing prostate cancer for men with one brother with the disease by age 65 years was 14.9 versus 4.8 percent in those without a brother with prostate cancer, and 30.3 versus 12.9 percent at age 75 years. When the analysis excluded those with low-risk prostate cancer, there was a similar increased risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional evidence comes from a prospective study of 203,000 twin pairs (80,000 monozygotic and 123,000 same-sex dizygotic) from Nordic countries; concordance for cancer in monozygotic and dizygotic twins was 38 and 22 percent for prostate cancer, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This study estimated that as much as 57 percent of the risk of prostate cancer could be explained by heritable factors.</p><p/><p>In addition to affecting the risk of developing prostate cancer, inherited factors may influence the prognosis for men who develop prostate cancer. In a Swedish study of 610 men with prostate cancer whose fathers had had prostate cancer, the survival of sons correlated with that of their fathers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When fathers survived for five years or more, the hazard ratio for death as a result of prostate cancer (deaths from other causes were censored) in their sons was 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.94) compared with those whose fathers had survived less than 24 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3127638973\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of specific genes identified in family studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies designed to identify predisposition genes in families with numerous individuals affected with prostate cancer have reported several DNA variants that are associated with a prostate cancer diagnosis, including <em>HOXB13</em>, <em>RNAsEL</em>, <em>MSR1</em>, <em>ELAC2</em>, <em>NKX3.1,</em> and others. </p><p>While variants in these individual genes may be strongly associated with a high risk of prostate cancer within specific families, there is substantial heterogeneity across the population and limited reproducibility between studies. Consequently, no single susceptibility locus has been shown to be responsible for a large proportion of familial prostate cancers. The degree of heterogeneity has prevented the use of these variants for ascertaining prostate cancer risk in the population. </p><p>Furthermore, variants in these genes have not been shown to associate with aggressive prostate cancers. Thus, men found to carry these variants may be less likely to benefit from early detection and treatment. Currently, the family history of prostate cancer may be similarly or more informative for risk of prostate cancer than the presence or absence of an individual single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or risk variant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3915947723\"><span class=\"h3\">HOXB13</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One example of a gene variant identified in studies of high-risk families is <em>HOXB13</em>, a<em> </em>gene that codes for a transcription factor that is important in prostate development. The molecular pathways and implications for the molecular pathogenesis of prostate cancer due to abnormalities in <em>HOXB13</em> remain to be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer#H20797464\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology of prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'HOXB13'</a>.)</p><p>The G84E variant of the <em>HOXB13</em> gene was identified by sequencing of the 17q21-22 region in four families with pedigrees strongly indicative of hereditary predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Confirmatory studies in 5083 unrelated European subjects with prostate cancer and 1401 controls found a 20-fold increase in the frequency of this variant in men with prostate cancer compared with those without prostate cancer (1.4 versus 0.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis that included over 145,000 patients reported an odds ratio of 3.23 (95% CI 2.3-4.6) for prostate cancer risk in men with <em>HOXB13 </em>G84E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Similar to most other genetic variants associated with prostate cancer, <em>HOXB13</em> G84E does not distinguish between those cancers exhibiting indolent versus aggressive features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4012620514\"><span class=\"h1\">POPULATION STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the past two decades, a large number of population-based assessments have been conducted to identify germline DNA variants that are associated with the development of prostate cancer. </p><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using panels of genome-spanning single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have identified more than 100 loci that associate with a prostate cancer diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/16-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-25</a>], including multiple loci in the 8q24 region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>] and the 17q region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], as well as other in chromosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Collectively, these variants are estimated to explain approximately 33 percent of the familial risk for prostate cancer. </p><p>Additional studies have focused on identifying variants specifically associated with aggressive prostate cancer, including higher Gleason score cancers, cancer recurrence, metastasis, or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, few such loci have been identified; the relative risks for these variants are low, generally with an odds ratio of less than 1.3, and have not conferred a sufficient level of risk to warrant routine testing in the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Ongoing studies are evaluating whether combinations of these common but low-penetrance alleles may collectively indicate a risk level useful for guiding screening or treatment recommendations. </p><p>This approach is illustrated by a study that utilized 2893 Swedish men with prostate cancer and 1781 controls. The risk of prostate cancer was evaluated using a panel of five SNPs from three loci in 8q24, as well as single sites in 17q12 and 17q24.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although the increased risk was relatively limited if any one of these SNPs was present (risk ratio [RR] 1.22 to 1.53), the risk increased dramatically if four of the five SNPs were present (RR 4.47, 95% CI 2.93-6.80). The risk was further increased if four or five of the SNPs were present and the subject had a family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative (RR 9.46, 95% CI 3.62-24.72).</p><p>Despite the association of these genetic variants with the development of prostate cancer, none of the five was significantly associated with prognostic parameters in men with prostate cancer (Gleason score, serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level at diagnosis, age). Although the information from a panel of these markers may be useful in identifying men who are at increased risk for prostate cancer, additional prospective evaluations are necessary to establish the utility of this approach.</p><p>Although a SNP associated with prostate cancer may not reside within a known gene, it can be used to localize candidate genes that require further confirmation. Among the genes that have been suggested in this way are <em>HOXB13</em>, <em>MSMB</em>, <em>LMTK2</em>, <em>KLK3</em>, <em>CPNE3</em>, <em>IL16</em>, <em>CDH13</em>, and <em>HNF1B </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/22,23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,28</a>]. </p><p>Genes identified through GWAS may eventually have a role in prostate cancer screening. Alternatively, given the increasingly appreciated complexity of the noncoding genome, it is also plausible that these SNPs affect the expression of distant genes or the regulation and function of noncoding RNAs in ways that are yet to be fully appreciated.</p><p>Limitations in genetic screening should also be noted. Differences in the contribution of various SNPs to prostate cancer risk across races and ethnic groups would not be unexpected. The vast majority of family and population-based studies designed to identify genetic risk variants for prostate cancer have been conducted in Caucasian populations, with very limited studies in other races or ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In addition, the absence of current &quot;risk-SNPs&quot; cannot be equated to lower risk, as a number of unidentified genetic factors may contribute to risk in a meaningful way.</p><p>Deletion of sequences from chromosome 8p is a common event in the somatic genome of prostate tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Results from genetic linkage studies have also provided some evidence that germline 8p alterations may be linked to hereditary prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Whether there is a connection between germline and somatic genetic changes has yet to be established.</p><p>Combining multiple SNPs with PSA may improve predictive power for detecting prostate cancer. The Stockholm 3 (STHLM3) study was a prospective, population-based screening study for men aged 50 to 69 years that combined plasma biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms, and clinical variables with PSA. In this study, the use of a combination of parameters was more effective than PSA alone in detection of prostate cancer Gleason 7 or higher and in a reduction of 44 percent of unnecessary biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Additional studies are needed in broader populations to determine whether new models and biomarkers can be combined with PSA levels and other clinical factors (ie, age, race, family history, prior biopsies) to identify men who are at particularly high risk for prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H735986102\"><span class=\"h1\">DNA REPAIR GENES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Germline mutations in genes involved in the process of repairing DNA by homologous recombination are associated with increased rates of developing several malignancies (ie, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome), as well as Fanconi anemia, an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia, predisposition to malignancy, and the presence of specific physical abnormalities. </p><p>Detailed genetic and molecular studies of Fanconi anemia have identified mutations in a number of genes that cooperate in repairing DNA. Although most notably associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, <em>BRCA1</em> and<em> BRCA2</em> also are prostate cancer risk genes. Further investigation is needed to establish the level of increased risk of prostate cancer for carriers of mutations in <em>ATM</em>, <em>CHEK2</em>, <em>PALB2</em>, <em>NBN</em>, and more recently implicated DNA repair genes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3903617279\"><span class=\"h2\">BRCA2 and BRCA1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>BRCA</em> mutations exhibit an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and men found to be carriers of <em>BRCA</em> mutations are often identified through the evaluation of families with women diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer.

It is characterized by a significantly increased risk for colorectal and endometrial cancer, as well as a risk of several other malignancies. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes: <em>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,</em> and <em>PMS2</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A study of 4127 men from familial cancer registries found that the cumulative risk of prostate cancer was significantly increased compared with the general population (6.3 versus 2.6 percent at age 60 years and 30 versus 18 percent at age 80 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Consequently, individuals considered to be at high risk, such as those from families already known to have a deleterious mutation, are those generally referred for evaluation. However, studies using panel testing and high-throughput sequencing technologies have identified other high-risk populations. </p><p>In a study of 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer, germline DNA was analyzed for the presence of mutations in 20 DNA repair genes known to be associated with cancer predisposition syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This cohort was not selected on the basis of a family history of prostate cancer. Mutations were identified in 82 men (11.8 percent). This was significantly more frequent than in a cohort of 499 men with localized prostate cancer (2 percent of men with low- to intermediate-risk cancers and 6 percent of men with high-risk tumors) or in a cohort of 53,105 men without a known cancer diagnosis (2.7 percent). Mutations were identified in 16 of the 20 genes studied. The most commonly involved gene was&nbsp;BRCA2&nbsp;(37 men, 5.3 percent). Other genes involved included&nbsp;ATM&nbsp;(11 men, 1.6 percent),&nbsp;CHEK2&nbsp;(10 men, 1.9 percent of those analyzed),&nbsp;BRCA1&nbsp;(6 men, 0.9 percent),&nbsp;RAD51D&nbsp;(3 men, 0.4 percent), and&nbsp;PALB2&nbsp;(3 men, 0.4 percent). Mutations were also identified in 11 other DNA repair genes.</p><p>Germline mutations in some DNA repair genes appear to be associated with more aggressive prostate cancer behavior. This is illustrated by a retrospective study of 799 patients, including 313 who died and 486 with low-risk, localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Germline DNA was sequenced for mutations in&nbsp;BRCA1,&nbsp;BRCA2, and&nbsp;ATM&nbsp;in all 799 cases. The combined incidence of mutation for any of these genes was significantly higher in those with lethal prostate cancer compared with localized disease (6.1 versus 1.4 percent). Furthermore, among those with lethal prostate cancer, the incidence of a mutation in <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>BRCA2,</em> or <em>ATM</em> decreased progressively as a function of age at death (10 percent for those &le;60 years to 3 percent for those &gt;75 years), suggesting that these mutations contribute to an earlier age of death due to prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2958755513\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatic tumor genomic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic tumor genomic testing has the potential to identify mutations in inherited cancer predisposition genes. There is increasing interest in and use of somatic (tumor) genomic sequencing approaches to identify prostate cancers with DNA repair alterations for clinical trial consideration (particularly poly-ADP-ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitors and platinums) and therapeutic decision-making. These assays use tumor biopsies or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sampled from blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer#H124033439\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational approaches for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'PARP inhibitors'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Because results of tumor sequencing have the potential to identify or suggest the presence of an inherited genetic risk factor, it is important to discuss with and consent patients to this possibility prior to tumor testing. In a study of targeted DNA sequencing of tumor-normal (germline) pairs for 451 patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, 27 percent were found to have a germline variant in a cancer predisposition gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Most commercial tests for tumor genomic sequencing are currently limited to reporting tumor-only results and are not intended or validated for germline cancer predisposition testing. However, the identification of a cancer-predisposition-associated mutation in the tumor (eg, <em>BRCA2</em>, <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, <em>PMS2</em>) should prompt referral to genetic counseling for discussion of the risks and benefits of dedicated, confirmatory germline genetic testing.
