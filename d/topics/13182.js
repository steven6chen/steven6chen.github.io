While contrast administration with CT is often necessary to obtain the diagnosis, there are small risks for an acute adverse reaction or contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).</p><p>Both the ordering provider and the radiologist share the clinical and legal responsibility for each patient undergoing an imaging exam. However, most third-party payers require that contrast administration be specified when<strong><em> </em></strong>the<strong><em> </em></strong>exam is ordered for their precertification process, thereby placing the provider in the position of having to make the initial choice. This decision should be made after mutual consideration of the risks and benefits. In cases in which the choice is not obvious, a dialogue between the ordering provider and the radiologist can be helpful. </p><p>Appropriate contrast utilization is necessary to obtain acceptable diagnostic accuracy. Omitting contrast when it is indicated, or giving it when it is not, can lead to diagnostic and treatment errors, and unnecessary morbidity and cost. Added or repeated tests, delayed diagnoses, and accumulated patient radiation exposure are all potential adverse effects of an imaging exam performed suboptimally.</p><p>Standards for patient preparation and indications for contrast vary among radiology practices. However, guiding principles are presented here. Patient evaluation for oral and intravenous contrast administration prior to CT is described in this topic. Guidelines on the appropriate indications for contrast use and procedures for patient preparation before the CT exam are presented. </p><p>Related UpToDate content discusses: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of acute allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term management of patients with allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Prevention of recurrent reactions&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathogenesis and diagnosis of CIN (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of patients at risk of induced nephropathy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2808967050\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF CONTRAST MATERIAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621119267\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of intravenous contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All modern clinical intravenous contrast injected for CT is iodine-based.

Intravascular iodinated contrast is also given in other fluoroscopic exams such as angiography and intravenous urography, so adverse events related to these exams also may be relevant. A history of reaction to intravenous contrast given for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is <strong>not</strong> relevant because MRI contrast and CT contrast are not molecularly similar and are not cross-reactive. No cross-reactivity between iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast media has been observed. </p><p>Providers need not specify a particular type of intravenous contrast material when ordering a CT examination; this is usually determined by the hospital or the practice formulary. For CT, there are no important differences among the modern agents with regard to safety or efficacy.</p><p>Iodinated contrast agents are classified as low-osmolality contrast media (LOCM), iso-osmolality contrast media (IOCM), or high-osmolality contrast media (HOCM). For intravascular use, LOCM and IOCM are in use; HOCM is no longer used. Many iodinated contrast agents have been designed and marketed but all are soluble derivatives of a tri-iodinated benzene ring. Low-, iso-, and high-osmolality contrast are approximately 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> H<sub>2</sub>O, approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> H<sub>2</sub>O, and 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. </p><p>HOCM are primarily of historical interest and are no longer used for intravascular administration due to a higher adverse event rate. LOCM and IOCM are considered equivalent with respect to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) at CT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H963766525\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of oral or rectal contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some enteric (oral or rectal) contrast is iodine-based. All enteric contrast has the small potential to elicit an acute reaction.

Positive enteric contrast (ie, high attenuation on CT), consisting of a dilute suspension of barium sulfate or a dilute solution of an iodinated agent, is used for most indications. Negative enteric contrast (ie, water attenuation on CT) is used to delineate the bowel mucosa and improve detection of active inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] or active gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Examples of negative contrast agents include very dilute solutions of barium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>, and polyethylene glycol. Plain water can be used as a negative contrast material to distend the stomach and duodenum, but does not distend the remainder of the bowel due to absorption. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2788385577\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR CONTRAST USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether enteric (oral or rectal) or intravenous contrast should be administered varies with the clinical indications for the CT exam. The American College of Radiology's (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria provide consensus guidelines on the choice of imaging modality and contrast material for many clinical situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is also necessary to detect active bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/4,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21-23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2772498281\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral and rectal contrast use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral contrast is necessary to evaluate for gastric or small bowel perforation following penetrating trauma or surgery and may help to separate bowel loops in thin patients with minimal visceral fat (ie, body mass index &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. Because it distends the stomach and intestinal tract, it improves delineation of the bowel from the mesentery and other peritoneal content (eg, hematoma, ascites, tumor nodules, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, oral contrast has been shown to be unnecessary for accurate diagnosis of appendicitis and diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Oral contrast is not indicated for evaluation of the liver, kidneys, collecting systems, bladder, spleen, adrenal glands, retroperitoneum, bones, or vasculature. Negative enteric contrast can be helpful in the detection of occult gastrointestinal bleeding when paired with multiphasic CT angiography.</p><p>Rectal contrast is indicated for the detection of rectal or distal colonic leak. For most other indications, it is unnecessary.</p><p>There are relative but not absolute contraindications to oral contrast administration. In patients who are at risk of aspiration, it should be withheld or given judiciously, since aspirated oral contrast can cause pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, oral contrast is potentially harmful and unnecessary to evaluate patients with suspected high-grade bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risk of aspiration may be highest with hypertonic oral contrast media compared with lower osmolality or barium-based solutions, but this has not been rigorously tested.</p><p>Oral contrast administration for CT in the emergency department has been associated with a 45- to 60-minute delay in disposition, which has led some practices to eliminate it for many indications in this practice setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In patients who have or are at risk for bowel perforation or a leak from a surgical anastomosis, barium-based oral contrast should be avoided. Extraluminal barium is thought to increase the risk for mediastinitis or peritonitis, although the evidence supporting this principle is incomplete and involves old agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-prior-to-oral-or-iodinated-intravenous-contrast-for-computed-tomography/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Patients with chronic leaks or fistulae are unlikely to be at risk for complications from barium-based oral contrast since<strong><em> </em></strong>these are cavities with chronic exposure to bowel content.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3235654883\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH HISTORY OF ACUTE REACTION TO CONTRAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute adverse reactions to contrast may occur after oral, intracavitary, or intravascular administration. For any history of an acute reaction to contrast, the provider should verify that the reaction was to an iodinated contrast (used for CT, radiography, fluoroscopy, or angiography) rather than to a noniodinated contrast agent used for other imaging modalities (eg, gadolinium used for magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). The clinical details of the index reaction such as symptoms, their duration, and required therapy should also be obtained. </p><p>Prophylactic measures are unnecessary in patients who have hypersensitivity to other allergens unrelated to iodinated contrast, including gadolinium contrast used in MRI.

If the prior acute reaction was to HOCM, the patient should be informed it is less likely to recur since LOCM or IOCM is now universally used for intravenous administration. If the index reaction occurred before 1995, the agent was likely HOCM because LOCM was not yet available. Despite the lower incidence of acute adverse reactions with LOCM and IOCM, cross-reactivity is presumed to exist between all iodinated contrast, regardless of osmolality.

This classification predicts the likelihood and probable severity of a recurrent reaction and determines the need for premedication prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113232\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113232 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Standard premedication regimens usually are orally administered over 12 to 13 hours, or intravenously administered over five hours. If an urgent examination requires contrast and there is insufficient time for premedication, the exam indication and the risks and benefits of contrast administration should be discussed with a radiologist. In general, if the prior reaction was mild, an emergent and necessary CT exam requiring contrast should <strong>not</strong> be delayed for premedication. (See <a href=\"#H538329602\" class=\"local\">'Premedication to prevent an allergic-like reaction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severely impaired renal function (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73m<sup>2</sup>) who are not anuric receiving chronic hemodialysis may be at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). In addition, patients with or suspected of having acute kidney injury (eg, due to sepsis, myocardial infarction, or a large-volume hemorrhage) should be assumed to have severely impaired kidney function and may be at risk for CIN. In these patients, other diagnostic tests, including noncontrast CT, MRI, or ultrasound should be considered. If contrast is to be administered, intravenous volume expansion with isotonic fluids may be an effective option (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113233\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113233 \">algorithm 2</a>).
