People with severe depression usually need medicines to get better, and might also need to see a counselor.</p><p>Some people whose depression makes them feel very sad might need &quot;shock treatment&quot; to get better. Doctors call this treatment &quot;ECT.&quot; During ECT, doctors pass an electric current through a person's brain in a safe way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43932624\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both treatment options take a little while to start working.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many people who take <strong>medicines</strong> start to feel better within 2 weeks, but it might be 4 to 8 weeks before the medicine has its full effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many people who see a <strong>counselor</strong> start to feel better within a few weeks, but it might take 8 to 10 weeks to get the greatest benefit.</p><p/><p>If the first treatment you try does not help you, tell your doctor or nurse, but do not give up. Some people need to try different treatments or combinations of treatments before they find an approach that works. Your doctor, nurse, or counselor can work with you to find the treatment that is right for you. He or she can also help you figure out how to cope while you search for the right treatment or are waiting for your treatment to start working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43932631\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide which treatment to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor or nurse will need to work together to choose a treatment for you. Medicines might work a little faster than counseling. But medicines can also cause side effects. Plus, some people do not like the idea of taking medicine.</p><p>On the other hand, seeing a counselor involves talking about your feelings with a stranger. That is hard for some people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43932638\"><span class=\"h1\">Is depression the same for teenagers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. The symptoms of depression are a little different for teenagers than they are for adults. Some teenagers are moody or sad a lot of the time. That makes it hard to tell when they are really depressed. Teenagers who are depressed often seem cranky. They get easily &quot;annoyed&quot; or &quot;bothered.&quot; They might even pick fights with people. Also, when treating a teenager, doctors and nurses usually suggest trying counseling first, before trying medicine. That's because there is a small chance that depression medicines can cause problems for some teenagers. Even so, some depressed teenagers need medicine. And most experts agree that depression medicine is safe and appropriate to use in teenagers who really need it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43932645\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I take medicine for depression and I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some depression medicines can cause problems for unborn babies. But having untreated depression during pregnancy can also cause problems. If you want to get pregnant, tell your doctor but do not stop taking your medicines. The two of you can plan the safest way for you to have your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43932652\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Generalized anxiety disorder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neuropathic pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-affective-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal affective disorder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-you-have-depression-and-another-health-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When you have depression and another health problem (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Serotonin syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=premenstrual-syndrome-pms-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
