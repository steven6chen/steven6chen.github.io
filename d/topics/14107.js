People who have this protein have an &quot;Rh-positive&quot; blood type. People who do not have this protein have an &quot;Rh-negative&quot; blood type. Having an Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood type does not affect your health. But problems can happen during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood.</p><p>Luckily, there is a medicine that can prevent these problems most of the time.</p><p>Women with Rh-positive blood do not have the problems discussed in this article.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596788340\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know my blood type?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will do blood tests at your first prenatal visit. This includes a test to check your blood type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596788355\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen when a woman has Rh-negative blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain problems can happen when a woman has Rh-negative blood and the baby in her uterus (womb) has Rh-positive blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Usually, during pregnancy, blood between the mother and baby does not mix. But sometimes it does, especially right after the baby is born. If a small amount of the baby's blood gets into the mother's blood vessels during delivery, the mother's immune (infection-fighting) system makes proteins called &quot;antibodies.&quot; In the woman's next pregnancy, these antibodies can cross the placenta and damage some of the next baby's red blood cells. This can cause a condition called anemia, which is when a person has too few red blood cells. If this happens, the baby can make more red blood cells, but sometimes not enough to prevent anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596788389\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know my baby's blood type?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes it's hard to know. If you know your baby's father's blood type, you might know your baby's blood type. If both you and the baby's father have Rh-negative blood, your baby will have Rh-negative blood.</p><p>If your baby's father has Rh-positive blood, your baby could have Rh-negative or Rh-positive blood. But if you have Rh-negative blood, the doctor or midwife will treat your baby as if he or she has Rh-positive blood. That way, any possible problems can be prevented.</p><p>It is also possible to figure out the baby's Rh blood type by doing a test on the mother's blood. But this test is not done everywhere, and your insurance might not cover it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596788406\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens next?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are Rh-negative, your doctor or midwife will do blood tests during pregnancy to check whether you have antibodies in your blood.</p><p>If you do not have antibodies in your blood and your baby is (or could be) Rh-positive, your doctor or midwife will give you medicine. This medicine prevents your body from making antibodies that could attack your baby's red blood cells. This can prevent anemia or other problems.</p><p>The medicine is called anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a> (sample brand name: RhoGAM). It usually comes as a shot. You will get it during your third trimester.</p><p>After your baby is born, the doctor will do a blood test to check your baby's blood type. If your baby is Rh-positive, your doctor will give you another dose of anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a> soon after delivery. If your baby is Rh-negative, you do not need another dose.</p><p>Women who are Rh-negative might also get anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a> at other times. Doctors give this medicine to Rh-negative women if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleed during pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a test during pregnancy called amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a miscarriage, which is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an abortion, which is when a woman ends a pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy that grows in the wrong place in a woman's body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596788421\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if I already have antibodies in my blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you already have antibodies in your blood, anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a> will not help. Your doctor will not give you this medicine.</p><p>But he or she will do different tests to monitor your baby during pregnancy. If anemia or other problems happen, he or she will talk with you about possible treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596788436\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I get pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you get pregnant again, you will need treatment again.
