Its primary symptoms are abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (eg, constipation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea), but these symptoms have no identifiable cause.</p><p>IBS is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition and is second only to the common cold as a cause of absence from work. An estimated 10 to 20 percent of people in the general population experience symptoms of IBS, although only about 15 percent of affected people actually seek medical help.</p><p>Several treatments and therapies are available for irritable bowel syndrome. These measures help alleviate symptoms but do not cure the condition. The chronic nature of irritable bowel syndrome and the challenge of controlling its symptoms can be frustrating for both patients and healthcare providers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of theories about how and why irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) develops. Despite intensive research, the cause is not clear.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One theory suggests that irritable bowel syndrome is caused by abnormal contractions of the colon and intestines (hence the term &quot;spastic bowel,&quot; which has sometimes been used to describe irritable bowel syndrome). Vigorous contractions of the intestines can cause severe cramps, providing the rationale for some of the treatments of IBS, such as antispasmodics and fiber (both of which help to regulate the contractions of the colon). However, abnormal contractions do not explain irritable bowel syndrome in all patients, and it is unclear whether the contractions are a symptom or cause of the disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people develop irritable bowel syndrome after a severe gastrointestinal infection (eg, <em>Salmonella</em> or <em>Campylobacter</em>, or viruses). It is not clear how the infection triggers IBS to develop, and most people with irritable bowel syndrome do not have a history of these infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with irritable bowel syndrome who seek medical help are more likely to suffer from anxiety and stress than those who do not seek help. Stress and anxiety are known to affect the intestine; thus, it is likely that anxiety and stress worsen symptoms. However, stress or anxiety is probably not the cause. Some studies have suggested that irritable bowel syndrome is more common in people who have a history of physical, verbal, or sexual abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food intolerances are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, raising the possibility that it is caused by food sensitivity or allergy. This theory has been difficult to prove, although it continues to be studied. The best way to detect an association between symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and food sensitivity is to eliminate certain food groups systematically (a process called an elimination diet), which should only be considered for patients in the care of a doctor or nutritionist. Eliminating foods without assistance can lead to omission of important sources of nutrition. In addition, unnecessary dietary restrictions can further worsen a person's quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of foods are known to cause symptoms that mimic or aggravate irritable bowel syndrome, including dairy products (which contain lactose), legumes (such as beans), and cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage). These foods increase intestinal gas, which can cause cramps. Several medications also have effects on the intestines that may contribute to symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many researchers believe that irritable bowel syndrome is caused by heightened sensitivity of the intestines to normal sensations (so-called &quot;visceral hyperalgesia&quot;). This theory proposes that nerves in the bowels are overactive in people with irritable bowel syndrome, so that normal amounts of gas or movement are perceived as excessive and painful. Some patients with severe irritable bowel syndrome feel better when treated with medications that decrease pain perception in the intestine (such as low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">imipramine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nortriptyline</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often begins in young adulthood. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome in the United States and other Western countries. In other countries, an equal number of men and women are diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. The most common symptom of irritable bowel syndrome is abdominal pain in association with changes in bowel habits (diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> constipation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is typically crampy and varies in intensity. Some people notice that emotional stress and eating worsen the pain, and that having a bowel movement relieves the pain. Some women with irritable bowel syndrome notice an association between pain episodes and their menstrual cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in bowel habits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Altered bowel habits are a second symptom of irritable bowel syndrome. This can include diarrhea, constipation, or alternating diarrhea and constipation. If diarrhea is the more common pattern, the condition is called diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; if constipation is more common, the condition is called constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person with irritable bowel syndrome may have frequent loose stools. Bowel movements usually occur during the daytime, and most often in the morning or after meals. Diarrhea is often preceded by a sense of extreme urgency and followed by a feeling of incomplete emptying. About one-half of people with IBS also notice mucous discharge with diarrhea. Diarrhea occurring during sleep is very unusual with IBS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The constipation of irritable bowel syndrome can be intermittent and last for days. Stools are often hard and pellet-shaped. You may not feel empty after a bowel movement, even when the rectum is empty. This faulty sensation can lead to straining and sitting on the toilet for prolonged periods of time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome include bloating, gas, and belching.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several intestinal disorders have symptoms that are similar to irritable bowel syndrome. Examples include malabsorption (abnormal absorption of nutrients), inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), celiac disease, and microscopic colitis (uncommon diseases associated with intestinal inflammation).</p><p>Because there is no single diagnostic test for irritable bowel syndrome, many clinicians compare your symptoms to formal sets of diagnostic criteria. However, these criteria are not accurate in distinguishing irritable bowel syndrome from other conditions in everyone. Thus, a medical history, physical examination, and select tests can help to rule out other medical conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians order routine blood tests in people with suspected irritable bowel syndrome; these tests are usually normal, but they can help rule out other medical conditions.</p><p>Some clinicians also order more invasive tests, such as sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, especially in people over age 40 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-sigmoidoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of different treatments and therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatments are often given to reduce the pain and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and it may be necessary to try more than one combination of treatments to find the one that is most helpful for you. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment is usually a long-term process; during this process, it is important to communicate with your healthcare provider about symptoms, concerns, and any stressors or <span class=\"nowrap\">home/work/family</span> problems that develop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitor symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in treating irritable bowel syndrome is usually to monitor symptoms, daily bowel habits, and any other factors that may affect your bowels. This can help to identify factors that worsen symptoms in some people with IBS, such as lactose or other food intolerances and stress. A daily diary can be helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61226\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef61226 \">form 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is reasonable to try eliminating foods that may aggravate irritable bowel syndrome, although this should be done with the assistance of a healthcare provider. Eliminating foods without assistance can potentially worsen symptoms or cause new problems if important food groups are omitted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Lactose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinicians recommend temporarily eliminating milk products, since lactose intolerance is common and can aggravate irritable bowel syndrome or cause symptoms similar to IBS. The greatest concentration of lactose is found in milk and ice cream, although it is present in smaller quantities in yogurt, cottage and other cheeses, and any prepared foods that contain these ingredients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55938 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>All lactose-containing products should be eliminated for two weeks. If IBS symptoms improve, it is reasonable to continue avoiding lactose. If symptoms do not improve, you may resume eating lactose-containing foods. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Foods that cause gas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many foods are only partially digested in the small intestines. When they reach the colon (large intestine), further digestion takes place, which may cause gas and cramps. Eliminating these foods temporarily is reasonable if gas or bloating is bothersome.</p><p>The most common gas-producing foods are legumes (such as beans) and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli). In addition, some people have trouble with onions, celery, carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, sprouts, and wheat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gas-and-bloating-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gas and bloating (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Foods that are easier</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following table provides a list of foods that may be easier to digest in people with IBS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69440 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Increasing dietary fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing dietary fiber (either by adding certain foods to the diet or using fiber supplements) may relieve symptoms of IBS, particularly if you have constipation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 3</a>). By reading the product information panel on the side of the package, you can determine the number of grams of fiber per serving (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51585 \">figure 1</a>). Fiber may also be helpful in some people with diarrhea-predominant symptoms since it can improve the consistency of stools. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A bulk-forming fiber supplement (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">psyllium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methylcellulose</a>) may also be recommended to increase fiber intake since it is difficult to consume enough fiber in the diet. Fiber supplements should be started at a low dose and increased slowly over several weeks to reduce the symptoms of excessive intestinal gas, which can occur in some people when beginning fiber therapy.</p><p>Fiber can make some people with irritable bowel syndrome more bloated and uncomfortable. If this happens, it is best to decrease fiber intake and consider other laxative treatments for constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress and anxiety can worsen irritable bowel syndrome in some people. The best approach for reducing stress and anxiety depends upon your situation and the severity of your symptoms. Have an open discussion with your clinician about the possible role that stress and anxiety could be having on your symptoms, and together decide upon the best course of action.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people benefit from formal counseling, with or without antidepressant or antianxiety medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other treatments, such as hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. Hypnosis is a state of altered consciousness that allows you to focus away from your anxiety or stress. Patients who are hypnotized are not sleeping, but are actually in a state of heightened imagination, similar to daydreaming. An expert can hypnotize an individual or you can learn self-hypnosis techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you to focus on a particular problem in a limited time period. You learn how your thoughts contribute to anxiety or stress and learn how to change these thoughts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation in a support group can also be valuable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients find that daily exercise is helpful in maintaining a sense of well-being. Exercise can also have favorable effects on the bowels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Irritable bowel syndrome medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many drugs are available to treat the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, these drugs do not cure the condition. They are primarily used to relieve symptoms. The choice among these medications depends in part upon whether you have diarrhea, constipation, or pain-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p>As a general rule, medications are reserved for people whose symptoms have not adequately responded to more conservative measures such as changes in diet and fiber supplements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticholinergic medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticholinergic drugs block the nervous system's stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract, helping to reduce severe cramping and irregular contractions of the colon.</p><p>Drugs in this category include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dicyclomine-dicycloverine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dicyclomine</a> (Bentyl) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyoscyamine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hyoscyamine</a> (Levsin). These drugs may be particularly helpful when taken preventively (ie, before symptoms) and thus are most helpful if you can predict the onset of your symptoms. Common side effects include dry mouth and eyes and blurred vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many tricyclic agents (TCAs) have a pain relieving effect in people with irritable bowel syndrome. The dose of TCAs is typically much lower than that used for treating depression. It is believed that these drugs reduce pain perception when used in low doses, although the exact mechanism of their benefit is unknown.</p><p>TCAs commonly used for pain management include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">imipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">desipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nortriptyline</a>. It is common to experience fatigue when starting a TCA; this is not always an undesirable side effect, since it can help improve sleep when TCAs are taken in the evening. TCAs are generally started in low doses and increased gradually. Their full effect may not be seen for three to four weeks.</p><p>TCAs also slow movement of contents through the gastrointestinal tract and may be most helpful in people with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p>Another class of antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be recommended if you have both irritable bowel syndrome and depression. Common SSRIs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluoxetine</a> (Prozac), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sertraline</a> (Zoloft), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">paroxetine</a> (Paxil), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">citalopram</a> (Celexa), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">escitalopram</a> (Lexapro) Other antidepressant medications that may be recommended include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mirtazapine</a> (Remeron), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">venlafaxine</a> (Effexor), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">duloxetine</a> (Cymbalta).

Loperamide and diphenoxylate-atropine are most helpful if you have diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, clinicians usually recommend that these drugs should only be used as needed rather than on a continuous basis. If you take loperamide, be careful to never exceed the dose on the label unless specifically instructed by your doctor. Taking more than the recommended dose has led to serious heart problems in some people.<br/><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eluxadoline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Eluxadoline</a> (Viberzi) has been approved for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea but is not commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-anxiety drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-anxiety drugs reduce anxiety. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Diazepam</a> (Valium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lorazepam</a> (Ativan), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clonazepam</a> (Klonopin) belong to this class of drugs. Anti-anxiety drugs are occasionally prescribed for people with short-term anxiety that is worsening their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. However, these drugs should only be taken for short periods of time since they can be addictive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Alosetron</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alosetron-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Alosetron</a> (Lotronex) blocks a hormone that is involved in intestinal contractions and sensations. It is approved to treat women with irritable bowel syndrome whose predominant symptom is diarrhea. However, it was withdrawn from the market soon after its introduction because of concerns related to safety.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Irritable bowel syndrome causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (eg, diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> constipation). Abdominal pain can vary in location and severity. Patients can experience primarily diarrhea, primarily constipation, or an alternating pattern of the two; additional gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no single diagnostic test for irritable bowel syndrome, and several other gastrointestinal conditions produce similar symptoms; a patient's history, physical examination, and blood test results are all reviewed to rule out other disorders and establish a diagnosis of IBS. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many different treatments available to relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome; these include the monitoring of symptoms and patterns, adjustment of the diet to increase fiber and eliminate foods that can worsen symptoms, psychosocial therapy (since stress may aggravate IBS), and medication. Treatments are often used in combination, and because of the variability of symptoms, different treatments work for different people. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Irritable bowel syndrome treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many herbal and natural therapies have been advertised for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, these therapies have not been proven effective and they are not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Herbs and natural therapies for irritable bowel syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although irritable bowel syndrome can cause pain and stress, the majority of patients are able to control their symptoms and live a normal life without developing serious health problems. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Irritable bowel syndrome prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2014\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
