In the 2016 revisions of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, &quot;mastocytosis&quot; was removed as one of the subtypes under the major category of &quot;myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot; and is now classified as its own major category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients may present with weight loss and fatigue, anemia, or other C findings. Other signs and symptoms may include flushing, hypotension, peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea and coagulopathy. Urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">pigmentosa/maculopapular</span> cutaneous mastocytosis lesions are typically absent. In MCL, the bone marrow is infiltrated by large numbers of atypical mast cells. The early stages of MCL usually cannot be distinguished from the other categories of SM.</p><p>In MCL, at least 20 percent of the nucleated cells on bone marrow aspirate are mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the bone marrow, mast cells can be immature and hypogranulated with blast-like morphology and high nucleus to cytoplasm ratios and may contain mitotic figures. For diagnostic purposes, the percentage of mast cells should be determined in a nonspicular part of the bone marrow aspirate smear and not in bone marrow biopsy sections.</p><p>The number of mast cells circulating in the peripheral blood can vary considerably. Some cases have more than 10 percent circulating mast cells. The term &quot;aleukemic&quot; MCL is used for cases with less than 10 percent mast cells in the peripheral blood. Patients with aleukemic MCL without anemia, thrombocytopenia, or organomegaly appear to have a more chronic form of the disease with comparably longer survival times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. However, even these chronic forms of MCL are expected to show progression over time with development of organ damage and compromise of survival. More data are needed to confirm whether the absence of organ damage adequately discriminates prognosis between these two MCL subgroups.</p><p>Serum tryptase levels are usually extremely high, but can vary from patient to patient. In a historical review of 51 cases, the median serum tryptase level was 433 (range 21 to 2357 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The frequency of the <em>KIT</em> D816V mutation is actually less in MCL compared with other subtypes of SM (eg, in the range of 50 to 70 percent) and may be explained by non-D816V <em>KIT </em>mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by mutations in other genes that have yet to be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Once a patient has been diagnosed with SM, the subtype of disease must be determined, as treatment and prognosis differ for each disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1264728346\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes of systemic mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies should include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function, albumin, calcium, coagulation studies, and a total serum tryptase level. All patients should have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with molecular analysis to detect the presence of the D816V mutation in the gene for KIT, the receptor for stem cell factor. In most cases, these studies were already obtained in order to make the diagnosis of SM. We also obtain bone densitometry in all patients. Additional studies, such as computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen, are indicated for specific presentations.
