The pressure builds up in a sac called the &quot;pericardium&quot; that is around the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69323 \">figure 1</a>). The pressure can be mild or severe. Cardiac tamponade can happen after a heart attack or heart or lung surgery. It can also be related to an infection or cancer that has spread.</p><p>Cardiac tamponade keeps the heart from getting enough blood back from the rest of the body. If the heart does not get enough blood back, it cannot pump as much out to the body again. If the heart is not pumping right, this can cause serious health problems. Cardiac tamponade that happens suddenly, such as from an accident, can be very serious. It can even cause death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14362107\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cardiac tamponade?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different depending on whether cardiac tamponade happens suddenly or slowly.</p><p>If cardiac tamponade happens suddenly, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath, fast breathing, or both</p><p/><p>If cardiac tamponade happens slowly, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain or discomfort, such as feeling like the chest is heavy or full</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting, or feeling faint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the lower legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14362121\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor can often tell if you have cardiac tamponade based on the symptoms. But if he or she thinks you have it, you will probably have the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>). It can show an abnormal heartbeat. Most people with cardiac tamponade have a fast heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; A chest X-ray can show if the heart is larger than it should be. This can happen if cardiac tamponade happens slowly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 3</a>). It shows the different parts of the heart and how well it is working. If you have fluid around your heart, this test can show the doctor if the fluid could cause cardiac tamponade.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14362136\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cardiac tamponade treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac tamponade is usually treated by draining the extra fluid from the sac around the heart. This relieves the pressure on the heart and lets it do a better job pumping.</p><p>To drain the fluid, doctors can use a needle and thin tube, or do surgery. If cardiac tamponade happens suddenly, the doctor might do surgery right away.</p><p>After the doctor drains the fluid, he or she will order another echocardiogram. This test shows if enough fluid was drained. It can also show if the fluid comes back.</p><p>A few people with cardiac tamponade do not have fluid drained right away. In these people, the fluid is not causing heart or blood flow problems. Or the extra fluid only causes mild changes in how the heart works. In these cases, doctors do regular exams and tests to check how well the heart is working. If another condition is making extra fluid build up, the doctor or nurse will treat that condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14362151\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericarditis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pericarditis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
