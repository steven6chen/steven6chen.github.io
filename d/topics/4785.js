As with other herpesviruses, it becomes latent after a primary infection but can reactivate with renewed viral shedding. Shedding can occur from multiple sites and for prolonged periods of time. Women can also become infected with a different viral strain. </p><p>CMV is the most common congenital viral infection, with birth prevalence of 0.48 to 1.3 percent in recent decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Congenital infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic; symptomatic disease can be severe and life-threatening. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic newborns are at risk of developing long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity, particularly deafness.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues specific to CMV in pregnant and breastfeeding women. General issues related to CMV infection and CMV infections in other populations are reviewed separately.

In a systematic review of studies that measured rates of CMV seroconversion, rates of seroconversion in different populations were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women: summary annual rate 2.3 percent (95% CI 2.1-2.4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care workers, including those caring for infants and children: summary annual rate 2.3 percent (95% CI 1.9-2.9 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daycare providers: summary annual rate 8.5 percent (95% CI 6.1-11.6 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents of a child:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not shedding CMV: summary annual rate 2.1 percent (95% CI 0.3-6.8 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shedding CMV: summary annual rate 24 percent (95% CI 18-30 percent)</p><p/><p>Other groups with elevated risk of seroconversion included families with a CMV-shedding member, female minority adolescents, women attending sexually transmitted disease clinics, and immunocompromised individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H744845589\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary CMV infection may cause a mild febrile illness and other nonspecific symptoms (rhinitis, pharyngitis, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fatigue) but is not clinically apparent in approximately 90 percent of cases. CMV mononucleosis can be accompanied by dermatologic manifestations in approximately one-third of patients including macular, papular, maculopapular, rubelliform, morbilliform, and scarlatiniform eruptions. Reinfection with a different strain of CMV or reactivation of virus in women with preexisting antibody generally does not cause maternal clinical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pregnancy does not appear to affect clinical severity. The integrity of the host immune system affects the spectrum of disease: Hosts with impaired cellular immunity are at risk for severe and disseminated infection. The clinical manifestations of CMV infection in adults are discussed in detail separately.

Seroconversion of CMV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in paired acute and convalescent sera collected 3 to 4 weeks apart is diagnostic of a new acute infection. The presence of CMV immunoglobulin M (IgM) is not helpful for timing the onset of infection because (1) it is present in only 75 to 90 percent of women with acute infection, (2) it can remain positive for over one year after an acute infection, (3) it can revert from negative to positive in women with CMV reactivation or reinfection with a different strain, and (4) it can become positive in response to other viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p>In the absence of documented recent seroconversion, it is difficult to distinguish between primary infection, reactivation, reinfection, and quiescent disease since all are associated with IgG and IgM antibodies, and rising titers alone are not diagnostic. Determination of IgG avidity is helpful to better determine the acuity of the infection and thus the risk of in utero transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. High anti-CMV IgG avidity suggests that the primary infection occurred more than six months in the past; low avidity anti-CMV IgG suggests a recent primary infection (within two to four months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It should be noted that commercial avidity antibody assays have varying performance characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], the interpretation of intermediate avidity and the optimal cut-offs for low and high avidity are not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and the cut-offs for low and high avidity vary among laboratories. The diagnosis of CMV is discussed in detail separately.

Seroconversion from negative to positive is diagnostic, if available. Primary infection is strongly suspected if IgM and IgG are positive and IgG has low avidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is estimated that 25 percent of congenital CMV infections in the United States result from primary maternal infection and the remaining three-quarters of infants with congenital CMV infection are born to women with preexisting seroimmunity to CMV (non-primary maternal infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This estimate was based on summary data on maternal-fetal transmission rates from a comprehensive literature review and previously reported nationally representative data on age and race-specific CMV seroprevalence and seroincidence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among pregnant women with a primary CMV infection, the risk of severe newborn sequelae based on maternal serologic diagnosis alone is approximately 3 percent and risk of any adverse outcome is approximately 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These risks are obviously higher if the fetus is confirmed to be infected. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of perinatal transmission'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and sequelae'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonprimary</strong>: Nonprimary maternal CMV infection occurs in women with initial acquisition of virus before pregnancy and is characterized by presence of maternal anti-CMV antibodies before conception. Like other herpesviruses, CMV establishes latency after the host is initially infected. Nonprimary infection, also sometimes called recurrent or secondary infection, may be due to reactivation of latent virus or reinfection with a new strain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because the diagnosis of nonprimary CMV infection is difficult, it is not known how many women have reactivation or reinfection during pregnancy, how many congenital infections result from reactivation or reinfection, and what clinical sequelae result in offspring after reactivation or reinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Available data on pregnancy risks of nonprimary CMV infection are based on women with preconceptional immunity. These data suggest that the frequency of fetal infection is low in women who seroconverted prior to conception, but infected fetuses are still at risk for symptomatic and asymptomatic newborn disease and long-term sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/4,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24-28</a>]. In one study, the frequency of hearing loss in infants with congenital CMV infection was approximately 10 percent, regardless of whether seroconversion occurred before or after conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the number of children with severe-to-profound hearing loss was significantly lower in children whose mothers seroconverted before pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1414965883\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunocompetent pregnant women with CMV infection should be offered supportive care for symptomatic relief, as needed (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for fever). Use of antiviral drugs for treatment of CMV infections in immunocompetent adults, including pregnant women, is rarely indicated. Several medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>) are available to treat severe end-organ CMV disease, but none have been shown to decrease perinatal transmission and fetal risks are unknown.

Reinfection with different viral strains is also possible. Although maternal antibodies to CMV formed as a result of primary infection provide protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], they do not prevent reactivation or reinfection with a different strain and thus do not eliminate the risk of congenital infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The rationale for offering prenatal diagnosis is to determine whether the fetus is infected (vertical transmission is not 100 percent). Some couples may use this information in decision-making regarding termination of pregnancy. It also helps patients prepare for the birth for an infected, and possibly affected, infant. Lastly, it may change the intensity of fetal monitoring (eg, frequency of ultrasound examination) and is informative for the pediatricians caring for the child. Maternal drug therapy has not been proven to improve outcome.

The six-week lag time reflects the time it takes for placental infection and replication, transmission to the fetus, viral replication in the fetal kidney, and excretion into amniotic fluid.

The proportion of infected infants symptomatic at birth was also similar for both groups <span class=\"nowrap\">(3/10</span> CMV-infected newborns in the hyperimmune globulin group [30 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">4/17</span> CMV-infected newborns in the placebo group [24 percent]). There were also no differences in the viral or immune characteristics of infected infants between the groups. In addition, the number of obstetrical adverse events was higher in the hyperimmune globulin group than in the placebo group (13 versus 2 percent). Two limitations of this trial are that it was not powered to detect small but statistical differences in outcome and investigators did not evaluate hearing loss, which is an important clinical outcome that potentially could be affected by this therapy. Until more data from randomized trials are available, practitioners should emphasize the simple preventive measures noted below. CMV hyperimmunoglobulin therapy should only be used in a research setting until more data are available. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for prevention of maternal and/or fetal infection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No CMV vaccine is available for use in humans, although several candidate vaccines have been developed and tested in clinical trials. In a phase 2 trial that included 464 CMV-seronegative women of childbearing age, an MF59-adjuvanted CMV glycoprotein B subunit vaccine had 50 percent efficacy at preventing CMV infection, which was the primary endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Congenital CMV infection was diagnosed in one infant of a vaccinated subject versus three infants of subjects who received placebo. The overall benefits were modest and the study was not powered to assess efficacy in preventing maternal-fetal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>It is unlikely that a CMV vaccine will be available for several years. In addition, the strategy of preventing primary maternal infection does not address the CMV-associated hearing loss and other neurologic sequelae in congenitally infected children born to women with preexisting CMV immunity. Ideally, a CMV vaccine that induces high titers of cross-neutralizing antibodies will be developed and will protect individuals from infection with antigenically different CMV strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Although the exact nature of protective immune responses against CMV has not been characterized, a recombinant CMV glycoprotein B vaccine with MF59 adjuvant appeared to boost both antibody and CD4 T-cell responses in previously CMV-seropositive women, thereby raising the possibility that these boosted responses may prevent mother-to-child transmission of CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-cytomegalovirus-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Cytomegalovirus in solid organ transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

CMV infection may cause a mild maternal febrile illness and other nonspecific symptoms but is not apparent in 90 percent of women. (See <a href=\"#H674777058\" class=\"local\">'Risk of seroconversion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H744845589\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV infections in pregnant women are classified as primary if the initial acquisition of virus occurs during pregnancy, and nonprimary if maternal antibody to CMV was present before conception. Nonprimary infection, also sometimes called recurrent or secondary infection, may be due to reactivation of latent virus or reinfection with a new strain. (See <a href=\"#H3020027978\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of primary maternal infection is the most important determinant of perinatal sequelae. The occurrence of fetal infection increases with advancing gestational age at the time of maternal seroconversion, but the occurrence of symptomatic newborns decreases with advancing gestational age and is unlikely near term. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of perinatal transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preconception seroimmunity provides substantial protection against the occurrence of fetal infection compared with seroconversion during pregnancy but does not completely protect the fetus from infection (fetal infection: approximately 1 percent versus 40 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110084\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110084 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of perinatal transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once fetal infection occurs, preexisting immunity provides limited protection against newborn disease and adverse outcome. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and sequelae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital infection may be symptomatic or asymptomatic in newborns. Most congenital infections are asymptomatic in the neonatal period. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and sequelae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected newborns are at risk for development of adverse sequelae in early childhood, but symptomatic newborns are at higher risk (eg, death 5 versus 0 percent, deafness 50 versus 10 percent). (See <a href=\"#H1669600844\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic newborns'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2711375833\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic newborns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gold standard for diagnosis of clinically suspected maternal primary CMV infection is based on seroconversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110083 \">table 1</a>). In the absence of documented seroconversion, the presence of anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and anti-CMV immunoglobulin M (IgM) may represent primary infection, reactivation, reinfection, or latent disease. In these cases, avidity testing is useful: High antibody avidity suggests infection occurred more than six months in the past, while low avidity suggests recent infection. (See <a href=\"#H1739744847\" class=\"local\">'How to test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing pregnant women for CMV is indicated as part of the diagnostic evaluation of women with mononucleosis-like illnesses or when a fetal anomaly consistent with congenital CMV infection is detected on prenatal ultrasound examination. (See <a href=\"#H1003166778\" class=\"local\">'Whom to test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not screening all pregnant women for CMV infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1524977865\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis may be offered when fetal infection is suspected because of primary maternal infection or findings on ultrasound, given the risk of several sequelae in offspring. Testing includes (1) amniocentesis after 21 weeks of gestation and at least six weeks after the presumed time of maternal infection to perform PCR for CMV DNA and (2) ultrasound assessment of the infected fetus to detect stigmata suggestive of fetal sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although fetal infection can be detected by polymerase chain reaction, fetal prognosis is difficult to predict. An abnormal ultrasound examination suggests a poor prognosis, while a normal ultrasound examination does not exclude the possibility of a symptomatic neonate or development of long-term neurologic morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H3182458187\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of clinical outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During pregnancy, there is no treatment proven to be effective for prevention of fetal disease or reduction in risk of sequelae. For pregnant women with primary CMV infection, we discuss available data on the efficacy of hyperimmunoglobulin and the limitations of the few published studies as well as potential side effects of this therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3136274955\" class=\"local\">'Hyperimmunoglobulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures to prevent CMV infection during pregnancy are based on good personal hygiene and using CMV-negative blood products when transfusing seronegative pregnant women.
