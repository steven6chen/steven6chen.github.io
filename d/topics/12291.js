A critically important aspect of perioperative anesthetic care is maintenance of physiologic homeostasis (eg, hemodynamic stability, oxygenation, ventilation, temperature). </p><p>Anesthesiologists and the anesthesia care team, including Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) or Anesthesia Assistants (AAs), select and manage intraoperative general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia (eg, peripheral nerve blocks), or sedation with monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Anesthesia teams provide care in operating room (OR) and non-OR locations such as endoscopy suites, interventional radiology suites, and interventional cardiology laboratories. Other anesthesia services include preoperative evaluation, postoperative management in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or intensive care unit (ICU), and management of both acute and chronic perioperative pain. </p><p>This topic presents an overview of anesthetic choices and services. Detailed discussions of each type of anesthetic care are found in separate UpToDate topics, as noted in each section below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3133118595\"><span class=\"h1\">PREANESTHESIA EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676530848\"><span class=\"h2\">Focused evaluation and planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before elective anesthesia for noncardiac surgical or other interventions, all patients are evaluated by an anesthesia provider to assess medical status and readiness for the planned procedure, implement strategies to reduce risks, and create an anesthetic plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Preanesthesia fasting guidelines to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents are applied in all patients having elective surgery including procedures performed under general anesthesia (GA), regional anesthesia, and monitored anesthesia care (MAC).

The plan for anesthetic and airway management follows from this prediction, since sedation or induction of anesthesia may result in airway obstruction and at least temporarily render the patient apneic.

For major or prolonged procedures, general anesthesia (GA) with airway management using an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway (SGA) device is usually the most appropriate primary technique, particularly if a deep level of sedation is required <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if airway access is limited. GA may be selected for minor procedures as well, particularly if this is the patient's preference. Depending on the location of the procedure, neuraxial anesthesia, a regional anesthetic technique (eg, peripheral nerve block, intravenous regional anesthesia), or local anesthetic infiltration by the surgeon may be selected. These techniques are often supplemented with lighter levels of sedation so that airway reflexes are maintained (ie, sedation with monitored anesthesia care [MAC]).</p><p>There are benefits and risks to any type of anesthetic (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Types of anesthesia'</a> below). When assessing whether avoidance of GA is appropriate, considerations include the patient's ability to lie motionless in the position required for the procedure, cooperate, and communicate, as well as willingness to undergo the procedure given the possibility of awareness with recall. In many cases, a combined technique (ie, GA plus epidural or peripheral nerve block for supplemental analgesia) will provide both optimal intraoperative conditions and excellent multimodal management of postoperative pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ANESTHESIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">General anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General anesthesia (GA) is appropriate for most major surgical procedures.

An inhalation agent is usually added as a component of anesthetic induction once initial loss of consciousness has been achieved with IV agents, although inhalation induction of anesthesia may be selected for certain patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113972 \">table 10</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anesthetic agents demonstrate a dose-response effect, with progressively higher doses providing progressively deeper levels of sedation and anesthesia. Notably, sedation progresses to GA as a continuum of effect during induction, rather than as a consecutive series of distinct states with clear transitions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107796 \">table 6</a>). As the patient progresses from Stage I to stage III surgical anesthesia, airway reflexes and patency, spontaneous ventilation, cardiovascular function, and muscle tone become increasingly depressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H2107374177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Continuum of sedation during anesthetic induction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway management </strong>&mdash; Airway management is an integral part of GA, allowing ventilation and oxygenation, as well as a mode for anesthetic gas delivery.

Ventilation by facemask is typically used during induction of anesthesia before placement of an airway device. For short cases that do not require muscle relaxation, airway management with facemask alone may be used when the anesthesiologist will have full access to the patient's airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Bag-mask ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Supraglottic airway </strong>&ndash; Supraglottic airway (SGA) devices are inserted into the oropharynx and have a ventilation orifice above the glottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79779 \">figure 2</a>). An SGA, typically a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), may be used as the primary airway device with either spontaneous or controlled ventilation, but does not provide complete protection against aspiration. Since the SGA does not seal the pharynx, the pressure that can be safely used to ventilate is limited by leak around the device, with resultant gastric insufflation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoventilation. Therefore, pressure-limited ventilation (ie, pressure support or pressure control) is usually used with an SGA in place, rather than volume-control ventilation. An LMA may also be used as a conduit for intubation or as a rescue device in a patient with a difficult airway. Sore throat, dysphonia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysphagia are the most common adverse events associated with use of an SGA, with an incidence ranging from 13 to 49 percent, and greater likelihood if higher SGA cuff pressures are used (eg, &ge;44 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anesthesia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Typically, an ETT with an inflatable cuff is used to create a seal for positive pressure ventilation and to protect the airway from secretions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a>).

Less commonly, IVRA is used for surgery on the foot or ankle. The technique involves placement of an IV catheter in the hand, exsanguination of the arm using an Esmarch bandage, inflation of a tourniquet, and then injection of a short-acting local anesthetic through the IV catheter (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>). Duration of anesthesia is limited by development of tourniquet pain and by duration of the local anesthetic. Details regarding the technique and potential complications are available in a separate topic.

Approximately one-third of ambulatory anesthesia services for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the United States are performed with MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anesthesia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Considerations in the decision to select a MAC technique include the level of sedation required for the surgical procedure, whether the anesthesia provider will have easy access to the airway if immediate airway control is necessary, and whether the patient is willing and able to lie motionless, cooperate, and communicate throughout the procedure. Classically, MAC anesthesia does not involve complete loss of consciousness. Often, the surgeon or interventionalist provides local anesthesia since sedation does not ensure pain control. Similar techniques and agents are used to provide sedation during procedures performed with neuraxial anesthesia or a peripheral nerve block. In all such cases, patients should understand that they will probably have recall of intraoperative events, and that they will likely feel pushing and pulling, but should not experience sharp pain. Further details are available in separate topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitored anesthesia care in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520191907\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Sedation during spinal anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Supplemental oxygen is typically administered via nasal cannulae or a face mask during spontaneous ventilation in a sedated patient. Supplemental oxygen delivery is more likely to be necessary during moderate or deep sedation since higher doses of IV sedative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesic medications can cause respiratory depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults#H1181392080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitored anesthesia care in adults&quot;, section on 'Supplemental oxygen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Conscious sedation without anesthesia personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) makes a clear distinction between light or moderate conscious sedation (often administered by non-anesthesiologists) versus MAC with an anesthesia provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anesthesia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Monitored anesthesia care (MAC)'</a> above). During light or moderate conscious sedation without anesthesia personnel, the depth of sedation should not render the patient unable to independently maintain airway integrity. By contrast, during MAC, an anesthesia provider must be prepared and qualified to immediately convert to GA with management of the patient's airway if necessary, particularly if deep sedation is required. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Induction and airway management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1524279553\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DURING ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors are basic physiologic monitors including pulse oximetry, electrocardiography (ECG), and a noninvasive blood pressure device, as well as a temperature monitor when clinically significant changes in body temperature are likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anesthesia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These standard monitors are discussed in detail separately.

Quantitative monitoring of the volume of expired gas is strongly encouraged. Other integrated monitors on all anesthesia machines generate alarms for common <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serious potential problems due to misuse by the operator or machine malfunction.
