Abscesses that are enclosed within the bony confines of the skull or spinal column can expand to compress the brain or spinal cord and cause severe symptoms, permanent complications, or even death. Prompt diagnosis and proper treatment can avert complications and achieve cure in many cases. Both the diagnosis and management of epidural abscess, which often includes a surgical procedure for aspiration or drainage of the abscess, have been greatly aided by the advent of modern imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Two distinct varieties of epidural abscess occur: spinal epidural abscess (SEA) and intracranial epidural abscess (IEA). SEA is more common by a factor of nine to one. The distinction between these two entities is based upon the different anatomy of the two locations within the CNS and some differences in symptoms and natural history. Intracranial epidural abscesses (IEAs) are less common than spinal epidural abscess (SEAs) and less acute in their evolution. However, like SEAs, IEAs are significant infections requiring optimal therapy to prevent complications.</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of IEA will be reviewed here. SEA, brain abscess, and bacterial meningitis are discussed separately.

Thus, under normal circumstances, there is no actual epidural space. The potential epidural space can be opened by pressure from expanding tumors, blood, inflammatory masses, or pus. This requires that the firmly adherent dura be dissected off the bone; as a result, intracranial epidural abscesses tend to be slow growing, rounded, and well localized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7942295\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organisms usually spread into the potential extradural space by direct extension from a contiguous focus of infection or by inoculation during trauma or neurosurgery. Organisms may also pass through the venous foramina of the frontal bone plate to this space without causing frontal bone osteomyelitis. After reaching this site, the bacteria cause inflammation and the formation of pus or granulation tissue, which gradually dissect the tough and adherent dura away from the inner table of the skull.</p><p>Intracranial epidural abscesses usually consist of a localized lesion with a central collection of pus surrounded by a wall of inflammatory reaction, which may calcify. They rarely spread downward (caudal) from inside the skull into the spinal canal because the dura is very tightly attached around the foramen magnum. These findings are different from those of spinal epidural abscesses in which granulation tissue rather than pus is a common finding and longitudinal spread of infection is virtually the rule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7942301\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial epidural abscess is the third most common focal pyogenic intracranial infection, after brain abscess and subdural empyema. However, it accounts for only about 1 in 10 cases of epidural abscesses, the other 9 being spinal epidural abscesses. In the past, most cases were associated with sinusitis, otitis, or mastoiditis. Today, many cases arise as a complication of neurosurgical procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7942307\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND PORTALS OF ENTRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual portal of entry is from the exterior. If the inciting infection arises from the paranasal sinuses or ears, the organisms are likely to be microaerophilic or anaerobic streptococci <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other anaerobes such as <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>) and <em>Peptostreptococcus </em>species. A few cases, particularly those associated with chronic sinusitis, are due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli or fungi.</p><p>If infection follows neurosurgery, the most likely organisms are staphylococci, especially <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and gram-negative bacteria. Infection can also spread inward from osteomyelitis of the skull or be introduced by fetal monitoring probes applied to the skull during birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7942313\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms develop both as a result of infection and the slowly expanding intracranial mass. The latter can eventually cause raised intracranial pressure, papilledema, and, in some cases, focal neurologic signs. Fever, headache, lethargy, nausea, and vomiting are common. Patients with intracranial epidural abscesses (IEAs) complicating sinus infections may have purulent drainage from the nose or ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Because an IEA usually arises as a complication of another process, the primary infection may be the focus of attention and delay diagnosis of the intracranial extension. As an example, local swelling and tenderness may be attributed to recent trauma, neurosurgery, or sinusitis when in fact it overlies an IEA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7942333\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key to diagnosis is to consider this rare condition then to perform a physical examination followed by appropriate imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast (eg, gadolinium) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105710\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105710 \">image 1</a>) usually provides more information than computed tomography (CT) with contrast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69915\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69915 \">image 2</a>). CT-guided needle aspiration or open drainage can provide material for staining and culture for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810502860\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intracranial epidural abscess can mimic any intracranial mass lesion, including parenchymal primary and metastatic tumors, meningiomas, hematomas, brain abscesses, or subdural empyemas. Chronic meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, and cranial arteritis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7942356\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810503974\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful treatment of an intracranial epidural abscess (IEA) usually requires a combination of a drainage procedure and antibiotic therapy. Neurosurgical drainage is most commonly performed via burr holes or a craniotomy. If the dura is macerated or breached, a graft or other occlusive approach may be applied.</p><p>Sinus-related IEA in children may be managed without neurosurgical procedures if there is adequate sinus drainage (by a surgical or endoscopic drainage procedure) and minimal mass effect from the abscess. This was illustrated in a study of eight children that compared a neurosurgical drainage procedure to sinus drainage without an intracranial procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients received antibiotic therapy with activity against the isolated organism(s). All patients had clinical and radiologic resolution of infection following therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810503347\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric antimicrobial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing of initiating antimicrobial therapy has not been established. The decision of when to start antimicrobial therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the clinical circumstances. In immunocompetent patients who are not severely ill (ie, do not have neurologic deficits and are not septic) and for whom a surgical procedure to drain the abscess is planned over the following one to two days, it is reasonable to delay antimicrobial therapy until a specimen of the abscess fluid can be obtained. In such patients, an empiric regimen should be started as soon as a specimen has been collected. In immunocompromised patients, patients who have concerning clinical findings, and patients for whom surgery cannot be performed within one to two days, empiric therapy should be started without waiting for a specimen.</p><p>There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating antibiotic regimens for the treatment of IEA. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be chosen based upon the probable origin of the infection and the most common pathogens. For example, if contiguous infection of the paranasal sinuses, ear, or mastoid is the source, a regimen that is active against streptococci, <em>Haemophilus</em> species, and anaerobes should be chosen.</p><p>An appropriate regimen for adults with contiguous infection is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [usually 1 g] intravenously [IV] as a loading dose, followed by 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [usually 500 mg] IV every eight hours)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>PLUS</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Either</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (2 g IV every 12 hours) <strong>or</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (2 g IV every four to six hours)</p><p/><p>In most other instances, an empiric regimen with antibiotics active against staphylococci, streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli should be chosen.

Specific regimens for bacterial meningitis are discussed separately; similar antibiotic regimens can generally be used for bacterial meningitis and epidural abscesses, although epidural abscesses require a longer duration of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by specific pathogens in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810503371\"><span class=\"h3\">MRSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given substantial rates of MRSA infections, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 8 to 12 hours for patients with normal renal function; maximum 2 g per dose initially, with a target serum trough concentration of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> should be used as initial therapy when <em>S. aureus</em> is suspected or proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. If susceptibility testing reveals MSSA, therapy should be changed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours). If the organism is methicillin resistant, vancomycin should be continued and dosed to achieve serum trough concentrations of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. A significant drawback to vancomycin is its poor penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of approximately 1 and 5 percent in uninflamed and inflamed meninges, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> can be added to vancomycin at a dose of 600 mg orally once daily or 300 to 450 mg twice daily because it achieves bactericidal concentrations in the CSF regardless of meningeal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/6,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,11</a>], although there are few data to support this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].<br/><br/>Based upon case reports and case series of patients with CNS infections caused by MRSA, alternatives to vancomycin include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> (600 mg IV or orally twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (5 mg of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">component/kg</span> IV every 8 to 12 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/7,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,20</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV once daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-abscess/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Although there are insufficient data regarding the efficacy of these regimens for the treatment of CNS infections caused by MRSA, these agents are reasonable alternatives when vancomycin cannot be used or is ineffective. Further studies are needed to establish the benefit of these agents for the treatment of CNS infections. This is discussed in greater detail separately.

The usual duration of antimicrobial therapy is six to eight weeks. The first follow-up MRI is obtained at about four to six weeks if the patient is improving or at any time if clinical deterioration occurs. We generally treat patients who have undergone surgical drainage and who have responded well to medical and surgical therapy for six weeks. We generally treat patients with associated osteomyelitis, patients in whom surgical drainage did not occur, and patients in whom the response to therapy has been slow for eight weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810502866\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With appropriate antibiotic and surgical management, the prognosis for intracranial epidural abscess (IEA) is good.
