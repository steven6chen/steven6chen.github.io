Subsequently, imaging findings from both echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging have been correlated with hemodynamic and cineangiographic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cardiac catheterization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of LVOT obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subaortic (ie, LVOT) obstruction in HCM is due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve contacting the ventricular septum in midsystole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79426\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79426 \">movie 1</a>). This creates mechanical impedance to blood flow as it exits the heart, resulting in a pressure gradient between the LV cavity and the aorta. Increased LV systolic pressures are recorded just below the level of the mitral valve leaflet-septal coaptation, while the systolic pressures above this point are similar to those in the aorta. The presence of SAM-septal contact at rest or with provocation will produce a pressure gradient of 30 mmHg or greater. </p><p>There are multiple morphologic alterations of the LVOT area and mitral valve that contribute to the development of SAM-septal contact, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowed diameter of the LVOT due to increased septal wall thickness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apically positioned papillary muscles that tether the mitral valve plane toward the ventricular septum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elongated anterior leaflet of the mitral valve</p><p/><p>As high velocity blood is ejected from the LV during systolic, the mitral valve is pulled or &quot;dragged&quot; toward the ventricular septum (Venturi effect), creating outflow tract obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. SAM usually involves only the anterior mitral valve leaflet, but the posterior leaflet and chordal structures may also be involved. When SAM of the mitral valve occurs, a gap may be present between the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets, which often produces posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation and which may also contribute to symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Development of mitral regurgitation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'LVOT obstruction'</a>.)</p><p>A substantial body of echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and cineangiographic evidence in patients with a resting LVOT gradient &gt;50 mmHg associated with SAM and mitral regurgitation has yielded the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/1-5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnitude of LVOT pressure gradient measured at cardiac catheterization correlates well with Doppler velocities and with the duration of SAM-septal contact.

There are several variables which influence mitral regurgitation, resulting in great interindividual differences in mitral regurgitation at comparable degrees of SAM of the mitral valve; nonetheless, there is a correlation between the severity of mitral regurgitation and the LVOT gradient. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 23 patients with obstructive HCM undergoing surgery, differences in mitral valve leaflet length and mobility appeared to influence the extent of mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

LVOT gradients are also influenced by a variety of factors that alter LV contractility and loading, including exercise, level of hydration, ingestion of alcohol, or heavy meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65749\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65749 \">waveform 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Evolution of LVOT obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of LVOT obstruction usually coincides with the period of most rapid growth in childhood, typically during adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62353 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>]. If LVOT obstruction is present prior to the child's period of rapid growth, the degree of obstruction usually increases during this period. In addition, some children who initially present with nonobstructive HCM develop echocardiographic signs of significant resting LVOT obstruction. The development and progression of LVOT obstruction is due to increases in both proximal septal hypertrophy and abnormal orientation of the mitral valve plane (ie, with the leaflets coapting closer to the basal ventricular septum).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition to end-stage HCM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive LV wall thinning occurs in approximately 10 to 15 percent of HCM patients, and may be marked and more common in those with severe (&gt;3 cm) LVH at initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This is associated with deterioration in LV systolic and diastolic function, and may be accompanied by loss of LVOT obstruction, which does not necessarily precede LV wall thinning in all patients. When wall thinning is marked, it is usually associated with replacement fibrosis and a significant decrease in systolic function. This stage has been termed &quot;end-stage&quot; or &quot;burned out&quot; HCM and is seen in up to 5 percent of patients from large cohorts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81390 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Natural history and prognosis&quot;, section on 'End-stage HCM'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1711150233\"><span class=\"h1\">HCM VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the classic description of HCM with or without LVOT obstruction, a variety of other HCM variants exist, some of which are managed quite differently than classic HCM. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3228546507\"><span class=\"h2\">Midcavity obstructive HCM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Midventricular (ie, midcavity) obstruction is an important morphologic variant of HCM, which arises from different anatomic and hemodynamic circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Perhaps the most common HCM morphology associated with midcavitary obstruction occurs due to the apposition of septum and lateral wall in the context of a small, hyperdynamic cavity. In these patients the intracavitary &quot;gradient&quot; does not usually produce clinically significant symptoms, although beta blockers appear to be the most reasonable therapy in symptomatic patients. </p><p>Midcavity obstruction in HCM can also be due to the systolic apposition of hypertrophied papillary muscle and lateral wall at the level of the mid-LV, producing two distinct LV chambers (ie, proximal and distal with an &quot;hour glass&quot; shape LV), and associated with an LV apical aneurysm of varying size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This phenotypic subgroup of HCM patients is uncommon, presenting in approximately 2 percent of patients with HCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2161960079\" class=\"local\">'Midcavity obstruction with LV apical aneurysm'</a> below.)</p><p>Another cause of midcavitary obstruction is anomalous insertion of the anterolateral papillary muscle directly into the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (in the absence of chordae tendineae). In this morphologic abnormality, the anomalous papillary muscle is often apically displaced and along with the anterior leaflet makes contact with the septum at midsystole to produce midcavitary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In this situation, patients may have limiting symptoms similar to patients with typical isolated LVOT obstruction. Clinical examination reveals the typical signs of dynamic obstructive HCM (eg, a systolic murmur that accentuates with exercise or a change to an upright posture). (See <a href=\"#H144481603\" class=\"local\">'Factors which affect LVOT obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pharmacologic-maneuvers-in-the-differential-diagnosis-of-heart-murmurs-and-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2161960079\" class=\"local\">'Midcavity obstruction with LV apical aneurysm'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of midcavity obstructive HCM can be made with echocardiography, left ventriculography, or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Imaging in isolated midcavity HCM shows absence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and a narrowed mid-LV cavity with or without an LV apical aneurysm. High Doppler velocities, indicating a midcavity gradient, are recorded at the level of the papillary muscle. Color Doppler demonstrates a mosaic pattern at this level, confirming that the level of obstruction is below the mitral valve leaflets. In some patients, the midcavity obstruction is associated with an apical LV aneurysm, which may be the site of origin of a rapid monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and clot formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59767\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59767 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Patients with HCM and midcavitary obstruction from anomalous papillary muscle insertion, with or without associated LVOT obstruction, and who have advanced heart failure (HF) symptoms refractory to atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents (ie, beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers), should be evaluated for invasive septal reduction therapy. In most cases, the identification of anomalous papillary muscle insertion sways the decision toward surgical myectomy rather than alcohol septal ablation, since only surgery can address the morphologic abnormality of midcavitary obstruction. In addition, advance knowledge of the anomalous papillary muscle insertion is crucial as knowing this information may change operative strategy to an extended myectomy and adjunctive papillary muscle shaving in order to provide the patient complete relief of outflow tract obstruction.

These patients represent a different phenotype than apical HCM in which LV hypertrophy is confined primarily to the apex. (See <a href=\"#H3851897598\" class=\"local\">'Apical HCM'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with HCM and LV apical aneurysms are at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (including sudden cardiac death), thromboembolic events, and advanced HF. The junction of the thin-walled scarred apical aneurysm and the LV myocardium provides a nidus for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and thrombus formation. For this reason, patients with HCM and an apical aneurysm appear to be at increased risk for sudden death events and stroke. There is no evidence that these apical aneurysms rupture or expand in size over time. In addition, these patients can also experience limiting HF symptoms, although this is often a result of developing systolic dysfunction rather than a consequence of midcavitary obstruction. Rarely, patients with HCM and an apical aneurysm will also have coexistent subaortic obstruction due to SAM-septal contact; in such patients, the clinical examination will demonstrate typical signs of dynamic obstructive HCM (eg, a systolic murmur that accentuates with exercise or a change to upright posture). </p><p>The diagnosis of midcavity obstruction with apical aneurysm is typically made with echocardiography, left ventriculography, or CMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic form of obstructive HCM is due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve with ventricular-septal contact occurring in midsystole. The high velocity of blood flow out of the LV during systole pulls the mitral valve leaflet toward the ventricular septum (Venturi effect), creating mechanical impedance to blood flow and a pressure gradient between the LV and aorta as well as posteriorly directed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. A combination of morphologic factors contribute to SAM-septal contact, including narrow outflow tract area, abnormal positioning of the mitral valve plane toward the septum, and elongated anterior mitral valve leaflet. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of LVOT obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to producing subaortic obstruction, SAM of the mitral valve also results in varying degrees of posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation due to a gap between the mitral leaflets. There are, however, interindividual differences in mitral regurgitation at comparable degrees of SAM of the mitral valve. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Development of mitral regurgitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There can be significant variability in the degree of LVOT obstruction in HCM. LVOT obstruction at rest is a consistent finding in some patients with HCM, while in others, there is no evidence of LV outflow obstruction at rest, but outflow tract obstruction which develops with certain provocative conditions. LVOT obstruction can be induced or increased by maneuvers that reduce preload (chamber size), decrease afterload, or increase LV inotropy. (See <a href=\"#H144481603\" class=\"local\">'Factors which affect LVOT obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of LVOT obstruction usually coincides with the period of most rapid growth in childhood, with the development and progression of LVOT obstruction being relative to increases in both proximal septal hypertrophy and anterior migration of the mitral valve. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evolution of LVOT obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midventricular (ie, midcavity) obstruction is an uncommon morphologic variant of HCM, although midcavity obstruction can frequently coexist with LVOT obstruction. Midcavity obstruction in HCM is typically due to the systolic apposition of hypertrophied papillary muscle and lateral wall at the level of the mid-LV, in the setting of a small cavity and hyperdynamic function. Some patients develop midcavity obstruction due to anomalous papillary muscle insertion directly into the mitral valve, which will make contact with septum and lateral wall during midsystole. Patients with HCM and midventricular obstruction with anomalous papillary muscle insertion and outflow obstruction who develop heart failure (HF) symptoms refractory to AV nodal agents should be evaluated for invasive septal reduction therapy. In most cases, the identification of anomalous papillary muscle insertion sways the decision toward surgical myectomy rather than alcohol septal ablation, since only surgery can address the midcavitary obstruction from this morphologic issue. (See <a href=\"#H3228546507\" class=\"local\">'Midcavity obstructive HCM'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with HCM and midcavity obstruction develop thin-walled scarred LV apical aneurysms. Patients with HCM and LV apical aneurysms represent a high-risk phenotype, and are at increased risk for sudden death events, thromboembolic events, and advanced HF symptoms. Identification of this unique HCM phenotype with LV apical aneurysm should prompt consideration for primary prevention ICD and anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis.

These patients do not have subaortic LVOT obstruction but may have midventricular obstruction from apposition of septum and lateral wall in the setting of a small hyperdynamic cavity. In contrast to many patients with typical subaortic obstruction, most patients with apical HCM present with no or mild symptoms. The approach to the management of apical HCM is the same as for most patients with HCM. Symptomatic patients are initially treated with medical therapy; however, since nearly all patients with apical HCM do not have evidence of LVOT or midcavity obstruction, septal reduction therapy is almost never an option in those patients.
