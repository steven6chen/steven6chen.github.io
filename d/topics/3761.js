The pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy is discussed elsewhere.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or birth asphyxia is responsible for some, but not all, cases of neonatal encephalopathy. Given that the underlying nature of brain injury causing neurologic impairment in a newborn is often poorly understood, &quot;neonatal encephalopathy&quot; has emerged as the preferred term to describe the clinical syndrome of central nervous system dysfunction in the newborn period because it does not imply a specific underlying etiology or pathophysiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Determining whether an acute hypoxic-ischemic event contributed to neonatal encephalopathy is challenging, since there is no gold standard test for diagnosis. The various clinical signs of HIE, including low Apgar scores, low cord pH, neonatal seizures, and encephalopathy, are nonspecific and may occur in the absence of global hypoxic-ischemic brain injury or long-term neurologic sequelae. However, when clinical symptoms suggest that HIE is the most likely cause of neonatal encephalopathy, a diagnosis of &quot;presumed HIE&quot; is often appropriate while awaiting additional test results, and while instituting neuroprotective therapies designed specifically to treat HIE. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

As the term &quot;neonatal encephalopathy&quot; became increasingly favored, it was shown in one US population that the diagnosis of &quot;birth asphyxia&quot; declined between the years 1991 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a 2010 review, the estimated incidence of neonatal encephalopathy was 3.0 per 1000 live births (95% CI 2.7-3.3), while the estimated incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (a subset of neonatal encephalopathy) was 1.5 per 1000 live births (95% CI 1.3-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Antepartum and intrapartum risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy are reviewed separately.

In the delivery room, the infant will often exhibit low Apgar scores and a weak or absent cry. The severity of neonatal encephalopathy can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to these clinical findings (see <a href=\"#H491308964\" class=\"local\">'Clinical predictors'</a> below).

The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At age 18 months, therapeutic hypothermia compared with usual care led to a significant reduction in the composite primary outcome of death or major neurodevelopmental disability (48 versus 63 percent, risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.69-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In subgroup analysis, the benefit of therapeutic hypothermia for reducing death or major neurodevelopmental disability was statistically significant for newborns with both moderate and severe HIE (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.81 and RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.92, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. To save one newborn from death or major disability, the number needed to treat (NNT) for those with moderate HIE was 6, while the NNT for those with severe HIE was 7.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reduced risk of death or major neurodevelopmental disability was seen with both total body cooling and selective head cooling (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85 and RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.93, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic hypothermia increased survival with a normal neurologic outcome at 18 months (40 versus 24 percent, RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.36-1.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>A 2013 meta-analysis reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Limited data regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia suggest that the benefit extends later into childhood. The NICHD trial assessed outcomes at ages six to seven years for 190 of the original 209 trial participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The proportion who died or had an IQ score &lt;70 was lower for children assigned to the hypothermia group compared with the control group (47 versus 62 percent) but the difference just missed statistical significance (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-1.01). In the TOBY trial, with outcome data available for 280 of the original 325 subjects available, the proportion of children who survived to ages six or seven years with an IQ score of &ge;85 was significantly higher for the hypothermia group compared with the control group (52 versus 39 percent, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.71) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. While these results are promising, more evidence is needed to confirm the long-term benefit of therapeutic hypothermia.</p><p>Despite the positive clinical trial results, therapeutic hypothermia started within six hours of birth has limited efficacy, as illustrated by the 2012 meta-analysis of the major trials, in which nearly one-half of all infants who were treated with hypothermia either died or had major neurodevelopmental disability at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, the utility of this therapy has not been studied for premature infants or infants with severe intrauterine growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Therefore, additional neuroprotective therapies and studies are urgently needed for neonatal encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The utility of initiating therapeutic hypothermia later than six hours after birth is unproven, and data are limited. One controlled trial randomly assigned 168 term infants with HIE to therapeutic hypothermia for 96 hours starting at 6 to 24 hours after birth or to noncooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. At 18 to 22 months of age, hypothermia was associated with a nonsignificant trend towards a reduction in the composite outcome of death or moderate to severe disability compared with noncooling (24.4 versus 27.9 percent, absolute risk reduction 3.5 percent, 95% CI -1 to 17 percent). Therefore, there is uncertainty regarding the true effectiveness of the treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116264898\"><span class=\"h3\">Implementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothermia should be started within the first six hours after delivery and continued for 72 hours at target temperature. The rectal temperature should be maintained at 33 to 35&deg;C (91.4 to 95.0&deg;F), with target temperature often set at 33.5&deg;C. Although direct comparisons are lacking, selective head cooling and whole body cooling appear to have similar safety and effectiveness. However, whole body cooling is preferred to head cooling in most centers in the United States due to ease of administration. Whole body cooling also provides easier access to the scalp for electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Cooling can be started and maintained during neonatal transport if there is need to transfer the infant to a specialized center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>Hypothermia for 72 hours with the rectal temperature maintained at 33 to 35&deg;C (91.4 to 95.0&deg;F) is the strategy used by the randomized trials that established the efficacy of this intervention. Four trials (NICHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], TOBY [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], neo.nEURO.network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and ICE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]) used whole body cooling to a goal rectal temperature of 33.5&deg;C or 92.5&deg;F (range 33 to 34&deg;C [91.4 to 93.2&deg;F]). Three trials (CoolCap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and two others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]) employed selective head cooling, with a rectal temperature maintained in the two larger head cooling trials at 34 to 35&deg;C (93.2 to 95.0&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/26,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,51</a>].</p><p>The duration of hypothermia in the trials was 72 hours, with the exception of one small trial that stopped cooling between 48 and 72 hours for newborns who recovered neurologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In a subsequent randomized controlled trial of 364 neonates with HIE that was stopped early for futility, the strategy of longer (120 hours) or deeper (32&deg;C [89.6&deg;F]) hypothermia, or both, did not reduce early neonatal death or death or disability at age 18 months compared with hypothermia for 72 hours at 33.5&deg;C (92.3&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112022127\"><span class=\"h3\">Low-tech therapeutic hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-technology therapeutic hypothermia, which can be used in low- and middle-income countries, is typically accomplished with cooling bags, packs, or other nonelectrical methods, and appears to be beneficial for the treatment of neonatal HIE, although the evidence is less robust than it is for the trials discussed above that employed advanced electrical cooling systems. In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials with over 460 infants, the group assigned to low-technology therapeutic hypothermia had a significantly reduced mortality rate compared with the group assigned to standard therapy, both at hospital discharge (12 versus 20 percent, RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.39-0.92) and at 6 to 24 months (18 versus 28 percent, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

The main finding was that a persistently severely abnormal aEEG at &ge;48 hours was predictive of an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome (ie, death or moderate to severe disability) at one year or more. In the pooled data, an abnormal aEEG at 48 hours had a good sensitivity (85 percent) and specificity (93 percent), while an abnormal aEEG at 6 hours had a good sensitivity (96 percent) but a poor specificity (39 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H491308999\"><span class=\"h2\">Biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no established biomarkers for determining the extent of neonatal brain injury or predicting outcome in infants with neonatal encephalopathy. In a systematic review published in 2009, serum interleukin-1B, serum interleukin-6, cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-1B (all measured before age 96 hours) were putative predictors of abnormal outcomes at age &ge;12 months in survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. However, all included studies had small patient numbers and significant heterogeneity. In subsequent small and uncontrolled reports of term newborns with neonatal encephalopathy who were treated with hypothermia, levels of serum S100b, NSE, neuronal glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) correlated with neurologic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/119-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">119-122</a>]. Given the shortcomings of these data, further studies are needed to determine if any of these biomarkers is useful for the early assessment of infants with neonatal encephalopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8677534\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous, clinically defined syndrome characterized by disturbed neurologic function in the earliest days after delivery in an infant born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation, manifested by a subnormal level of consciousness or seizures, often accompanied by difficulty with initiating and maintaining respiration and with depression of tone and reflexes. Neonatal encephalopathy can result from a wide variety of conditions. Acute hypoxic-ischemic events are responsible for some, but not all, cases of neonatal encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Term newborns presenting with neonatal encephalopathy may require immediate resuscitation and should be triaged as quickly as possible to determine eligibility for therapeutic hypothermia, which must be started within six hours of birth. (See <a href=\"#H491310114\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16891629\" class=\"local\">'Rapid assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All infants with neonatal encephalopathy should have a comprehensive evaluation, including an assessment of neonatal clinical status and all potentially contributing factors, such as maternal medical history, obstetric antecedents, intrapartum factors (including fetal heart rate monitoring results and issues related to delivery), and placental pathology. Neuroimaging, especially brain MRI, often provides information regarding the nature, pattern, and extent of brain injury. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of markers are helpful for determining the likelihood that an acute peripartum or intrapartum hypoxic-ischemic event contributed to the development of neonatal encephalopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F96192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96192 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2165814712\" class=\"local\">'Markers of acute hypoxia-ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For term or late preterm infants with neonatal encephalopathy who meet specified criteria for presumed hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), we suggest the use of therapeutic head cooling or whole body cooling maintained for 72 hours at 33 to 35&deg;C (91.4 to 95.0&deg;F) and started within the first six hours after delivery in experienced centers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic hypothermia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of moderate and severe neonatal encephalopathy should take place in a neonatal intensive care unit. Central aspects of supportive care include the following (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8678465\" class=\"local\">'Supportive management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance of adequate ventilation (avoidance of hypoxemia or hyperoxia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance of sufficient brain and organ perfusion (avoidance of systemic hypotension or hypertension; avoidance of hyperviscosity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance of normal metabolic status (eg, normoglycemia, nutritional status, pH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Control of seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Control of brain edema (avoidance of fluid overload)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Close monitoring of core body temperature and measures to avoid or minimize hyperthermia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants with mild encephalopathy develop normally, while infants with moderate to severe encephalopathy are more likely to develop long-term neurologic morbidity. Severe brain MRI abnormalities are usually associated with marked electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities and poor outcome. Permanent neurologic sequelae can be mild, such as specific learning difficulties or attention deficit disorder, or may be severe and disabling, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, visual impairment, and severe cognitive and developmental disorders.
