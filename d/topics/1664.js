Fatal cases of B virus infection have been reported after exposures to monkey bites, monkey scratches, cage scratches, a mucosal splash from monkey material, and from infected cell cultures. Postexposure prophylaxis has been demonstrated to be effective in an animal model and is likely effective in humans exposed to the virus. Prompt therapy for B virus infection of humans is critical to prevent severe morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, prognosis, prevention, postexposure prophylaxis, and treatment of B virus infection will be reviewed here. Infections caused by other zoonoses are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-pets-other-than-dogs-and-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from pets other than dogs and cats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from cats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-dogs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from dogs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural infection in macaques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B virus is a herpesvirus in the same subfamily as herpes simplex virus (HSV) that naturally infects macaque monkeys (eg, rhesus macaques, cynomolgus monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, bonnet macaques, Japanese macaques, and stump-tail macaques) and usually results in either no symptoms in these animals or oral or genital lesions similar to HSV in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. B virus has not been detected in other Old World monkeys or in New World monkeys.</p><p>Macaques become latently infected and virus is shed lifelong in oral and genital secretions and from the conjunctivae, including when animals are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The complete sequence of the virus has been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection of humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of B virus infections in humans has occurred in individuals who work with nonhuman primates. Humans become infected after exposure to oral, genital, or ocular secretions or central nervous system tissue from macaque monkeys. Of 26 well-documented cases of B virus infection in humans, 10 cases were due to monkey bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and two each were due to monkey scratches, monkey cage scratches, needlestick injuries, or possible aerosols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One of the needlestick injuries was from a needle used to inject tissues around the eye of an animal and may have been contaminated with infected ocular secretions. Exposure to monkey blood has not been reported to cause B virus disease in humans. One of the possible aerosol exposures was thought to occur during autopsy of a monkey.</p><p>Case reports include a mucosal splash in which a woman died after material from a monkey splashed into her eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], person-to-person transmission in which a woman became infected after applying glucocorticoid cream to her husband's vesicular B virus lesion and then to her contact dermatitis lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a laceration from a tissue culture bottle used to grow monkey cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], contamination of a wound with monkey saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and cleaning a monkey skull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One case was thought to be due to reactivation of B virus; however, it is uncertain if this really was due to reactivation or an unappreciated recent exposure to the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another case report describes reactivation of the virus in the eye of a person previously exposed to B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Travelers have the potential to be exposed to free-ranging monkeys that are seropositive for B virus, which are native in India, Indonesia, and Nepal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In addition, monkeys that are seropositive for B virus have escaped from research institutes and are now free-ranging in certain locations such as Puerto Rico and other sites in the Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Macaques, including cynomolgus monkeys, have been kept as pets, some of which are seropositive for B virus, and this has the potential to be a source of transmission of virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the age and the health status of macaques contribute to the risk of transmitting B virus. Most animals more than 2.5 years old have been infected with B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Animals that are immunocompromised, ill, stressed, or have visible genital or oral lesions are more likely to shed B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/3,5,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,22-25</a>]. Virus is shed from oral and genital secretions as well as from the conjunctivae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/3,22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22,24,25</a>].</p><p>Since 20 to 100 percent of captive macaques are seropositive for B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and approximately 2 percent of seropositive macaques shed B virus on a given day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], it is estimated that 0.4 to 2 percent of contacts with macaques have the potential to transmit B virus to humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. With the large number of exposures to macaques that occur each year, the observation that only about 50 cases of B virus have been reported in the literature indicates that the vast majority of B virus exposures in humans do not result in disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Certain types of exposures to macaques carry a higher risk of transmitting virus than others. Wounds involving the head or neck (in which the virus can be transmitted more rapidly to the central nervous system before the development of local symptoms), deep puncture wounds, and wounds that are not adequately cleaned are thought to pose the highest risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In contrast, exposures that involve intact skin are not thought to pose a risk of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately five days to three weeks after an exposure (range two days to five weeks), patients present with one of three patterns of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vesicular or ulcerative lesions, tingling, pain, or itching at the site of exposure, and local lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza-like illness with fever and myalgias.

In a study of 321 primate workers, none of 166 persons with documented exposures to primates and none of the other 155 individuals were seropositive for B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a second study, none of 116 asymptomatic primate workers tested during a cluster of B virus cases were seropositive for B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A third study found that none of 130 persons who either had contact with B virus&ndash;infected individuals or who were primate workers were seropositive for B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the availability of antiviral therapy, the mortality rate of B virus infection in humans was 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is estimated that 80 percent of individuals infected with B virus since the early 1980s have survived due to the availability of antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. To date, no cases have occurred in individuals who have received postexposure prophylaxis with antiviral medication within three days of B virus exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primate workers need to be appropriately educated about the risk of exposure to B virus, be knowledgeable about the importance of wound cleansing and first aid, have access to an eyewash, and have access to an occupational healthcare system that is knowledgeable about the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Persons working with macaques should protect their eyes from mucosal splashes with either goggles or glasses that have side shields and either a chin-length face shield or mask to protect their mouths from splashes. Body fluids from patients suspected of having B virus infection should be considered potentially infectious.</p><p>Family members and healthcare workers should use blood and body fluid precautions to avoid exposure to B virus from infected individuals. B virus has been cultured from the oral mucosa and from skin lesions in a patient during intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTEXPOSURE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After injury to the skin and exposure to macaque fluids or tissues, the skin should be thoroughly washed as soon as possible with soap containing detergent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> or briefly with a fresh 1:20 dilution of bleach (0.25% hypochlorite) followed by detergent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although positive cultures at the site of the exposure indicate that a true exposure to B virus occurred, cultures may be negative due to sampling error or removal of virus during cleansing. Obtaining cultures prior to cleansing is not recommended due to the risk of infection from delay of cleansing or from inoculation of virus deeper into the wound.</p><p>There is even more uncertainty regarding the value of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B virus, since a positive result does not necessarily indicate infectious virus.</p><p>Serology for B virus can be helpful in persons who have symptoms that are suggestive of B virus. Comparison of B virus serology three to six weeks after the exposure (or at the time of symptoms) with serology before or at the time of the exposure is especially helpful. For this reason, some occupational health centers obtain serologies on nonhuman primate workers before employment. A rise of &ge;4-fold in titer of paired sera tested concurrently is considered diagnostic of infection.</p><p>For individuals who receive postexposure prophylaxis, seroconversion might be delayed and repeat testing should be considered approximately three months after exposure.

A negative serology for B virus might occur in an animal early after primary infection, and a positive serology does not prove that the animal is shedding virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A negative culture may occur due to sampling error, and a positive culture from the animal does not prove that an exposed human was infected.

This high dose of acyclovir is recommended because of the higher IC<sub>50</sub> for B virus than for herpes simplex virus. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 12 hours) is the alternative medication.

The rationale for using ganciclovir in patients with nervous system disease is based on its superior efficacy compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> in the rabbit model cited above and the successful outcome in a patient with B virus encephalitis treated with ganciclovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

We recommend that two consecutive oropharyngeal and conjunctival cultures for B virus be obtained after symptoms have resolved and IV therapy is about to be changed to oral therapy as discussed below. In general, cultures for B virus should be obtained and remain negative for 10 to 14 days each time there is a change in therapy or if therapy is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Most experts recommend that oral antiviral therapy at postexposure prophylaxis doses be given for up to one year after high-dose IV treatment is discontinued, since B virus might establish latency in humans and intermittent shedding could occur, although this has not been proven.

Long-term suppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> for up to 10 years or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> for up to 1 year has been well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Fatal cases of B virus infection have been reported after exposures to monkey bites, monkey scratches, cage scratches, a mucosal splash from monkey material, and from infected cell cultures. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infection of humans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macaques become latently infected, and virus is shed lifelong in oral and genital secretions and from the conjunctivae, including when animals are asymptomatic.
