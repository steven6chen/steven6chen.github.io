The peak prevalence is during the preschool years in most reports. There is no consistent effect of gender on the prevalence of childhood constipation. </p><p>Complaints range from infrequent bowel evacuation, hard small feces, difficult or painful evacuation of large-diameter stools, and fecal incontinence (voluntary or involuntary evacuation of feces into the underwear, also known as encopresis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Most but not all children with fecal incontinence have underlying constipation. </p><p>Functional constipation is responsible for more than 95 percent of cases of constipation in healthy children one year and older, and is particularly common among preschool aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although it is common, it is important to evaluate affected children to identify the few that have organic causes of constipation. Moreover, children with functional constipation will benefit from prompt and thorough treatment interventions. Delayed or inadequate intervention may result in stool withholding behavior with worsening constipation and psychosocial consequences. </p><p>The evaluation of an infant or child with constipation will be reviewed here.

The history should be obtained from the parents or caretakers, and also from the child, if this is appropriate for his or her age. The partnership established with the family should continue until the constipation is resolved, to ensure that symptoms do not progress and become more problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>In an infant, apparent straining during defecation does not necessarily indicate constipation. If accompanied by the passage of soft stools in an otherwise healthy infant, this symptom is known as &quot;infant dyschezia&quot; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704000033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Infant dyschezia'</a>). Organic causes of constipation should be considered if the straining behavior is accompanied by hard stools or if warning signs are present. The most important organic causes of constipation in infants are Hirschsprung disease and cystic fibrosis. In particular, a history of delayed passage of meconium should raise concerns about the possibility of Hirschsprung disease, as more than 90 percent of normal newborns but only 10 percent of infants with Hirschsprung disease pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life.

This relationship between abnormal bowel and bladder function is referred to as the bowel bladder dysfunction, also known as dysfunctional elimination syndrome. Although bladder dysfunction is commonly associated with functional constipation, neurogenic disorders must also be excluded. Successful treatment of the constipation is an important component of treating the bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Patients with generalized lower motor neuron dysfunction, suggested by hyporeflexia and hypotonia, develop constipation because of slow intestinal transit, and the problem may be complicated by fecal incontinence due to decreased anal sphincter tone. In patients with upper motor neuron dysfunction, suggested by hypertonia and hyperreflexia, constipation is caused by overactive pelvic muscle contraction and inability to voluntarily relax the external anal sphincter. Abnormal deep tendon reflexes (delayed relaxation) are also seen in hypothyroidism, a rare cause of constipation in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704003529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perineum</strong> &ndash; The perineum should be inspected for abnormalities of anorectal development, which represent a spectrum from high imperforate anus to anteriorly displaced anus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78404\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78404 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When the communication is abnormally close to the fourchette or scrotum, the anus is considered &quot;anteriorly displaced&quot; or &quot;ectopic&quot;. An anteriorly displaced anus is easily overlooked. The abnormality is suggested by noting that the anal opening is not located in the center of the pigmented area of the perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62573%7EPEDS%2F65755\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62573 graphicRef65755 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The diagnosis is supported by measuring the Anal Position Index (API), which is defined as the ratio of the <span class=\"nowrap\">anus-fourchette/scrotum</span> distance to the <span class=\"nowrap\">coccyx-fourchette/scrotum</span> distance. Measurements are most easily made by placing a strip of clear tape on the longitudinal axis of the perineum, marking the positions of the coccyx, anus, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fourchette/scrotum,</span> then removing the tape for measurement against a standard ruler. Normal ratios are discussed elsewhere.

However, some providers perform a digital examination in selected cases of suspected functional constipation. The goals of the examination are to detect a fecal impaction, which would require a &quot;cleanout&quot; approach (initiation of treatment with high doses of laxatives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enemas), and to detect occult blood, which would require further diagnostic testing.</p><p>A digital examination <strong>is</strong> suggested for the following groups of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with symptoms since early infancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants or children with other alarm signs that suggest organic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94989 \">table 2</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children in whom the presence or degree of constipation is unclear (eg, meeting only one Rome IV criterion) </p><p/><p>Findings suggestive of Hirschsprung disease include a tight anal canal with an empty ampulla.

Thus, they are not an essential part of the evaluation of constipation and should not be used as a substitute for a thorough history and physical examination.

This study is generally reserved for the secondary evaluation of selected patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear despite a thorough initial evaluation and trials of treatment. In particular, it may be useful for the following purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To help distinguish between retentive fecal incontinence (constipation-associated) and non-retentive fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To identify children with abnormally slow movement of food residue through the colon, a condition referred to as &quot;slow-transit&quot; constipation. Slow transit constipation is more likely in children with onset of symptoms before three years of age, severe symptoms (passing less than one stool a week), and lack of response to optimal standard therapy with laxatives and behavioral intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To identify children with stool expulsion disorders, suggesting outlet obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; Colonic transit studies can be performed using a variety of protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. One of the easiest techniques is to have the child swallow a capsule containing 24 radiopaque markers (Sitzmark capsules) once a day for three days. Plain radiographs are taken on the fourth day (and sometimes also on the seventh day), and analyzed for the number and location of retained markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Ideally, any fecal impaction should be relieved, and laxatives should be discontinued several days prior to performing the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The colonic transit time (CTT) can then be calculated with the following formula:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the day 4 films:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Colonic transit time (hours) = # markers remaining x 1.0</p></div></div><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">(where 1.0 = 72 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/72</span> markers ingested)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the day 7 films:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Colonic transit time (hours) = # markers remaining x 2.3</p></div></div><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">(where 2.3 = 168 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/72</span> markers ingested)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If capsules containing 20 (rather than 24) radiopaque markers are used, the constant 1.2 is used for the day 4 calculation, and 2.8 for the day 7 calculation. If the capsules containing radiopaque markers are not available, segments of number 10 radiopaque nasogastric tube cut into 1 cm lengths can be used as markers, and the constant adjusted according to the number of markers ingested. Transit time also may be analyzed by colonic segment, using similar calculations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interpretation</strong> &ndash; Children with functional constipation tend to have slower CTT than those without constipation. In one study of adolescents, CTT was 58.3 for those with constipation and 30.2 hours for those without constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The term &quot;slow transit constipation&quot; is used to describe particularly severe delays in CTT (&gt;100 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Slow transit constipation is a clinical description rather than a disease because it remains unclear whether this group of children is distinct from those with functional constipation. A few children with slow transit constipation have disorders associated with colonic dysmotility, which include intestinal neuronal dysplasia and intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B. We suggest early referral to a gastroenterologist for patients with this profile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H1006631541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Slow-transit constipation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A colonic transit study also may help to identify patients with outlet obstruction, manifested by accumulation of markers in the rectosigmoid area.

However, this pattern also may be seen in patients with fecal impaction and in those with abnormal responses of the pelvic floor muscles during defecation.

The procedure includes measurements of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (which is absent in Hirschsprung disease), rectal sensation and compliance, and squeeze pressures. The test is performed mainly in children with intractable constipation that restricts their lifestyle, or when there is suspicion of internal anal sphincter achalasia, or Hirschsprung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation/abstract/14,21,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,28-30</a>]. Anorectal manometry also can identify patients with dyssynergic defecation, which is a functional disorder characterized by the incomplete evacuation of fecal material from the rectum due to paradoxical contraction or failure to relax pelvic floor muscles when straining to defecate. The chances of artifact due to catheter movement (which can mimic rectoanal inhibitory response) are higher in children less than six months of age. Definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease is made by rectal biopsy.

The symptoms must be present for one month in infants and toddlers, and two months in older children. The diagnosis also requires exclusion of organic causes of the symptoms. Functional constipation usually can be diagnosed based upon the history and physical examination. Key elements of the history and physical examination are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830 \">table 1</a>).

Hirschsprung disease should be particularly considered for infants presenting with constipation during the neonatal period. Other causes of constipation or delayed passage of meconium in the early neonatal period are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82181 \">table 3</a>).
