There is seasonal variation, with more cases occurring during the winter months. The rates of pneumonia are higher for men than for women and for black persons compared with Caucasians. The etiology of CAP varies by geographic region; however, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is the most commonly identified bacterial cause of CAP worldwide. Viruses are common causes of CAP as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The microbiology of CAP is discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2005, pneumonia and influenza combined was the eighth most common cause of death in the United States and the seventh most common cause of death in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. There were over 60,000 deaths due to pneumonia in the United States. Mortality is highest for CAP patients who require hospitalization. Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database estimate the 30-day mortality rate of CAP patients (mostly those &gt;65 years of age) requiring admission to the hospital in the United States to be approximately 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Overall mortality may also vary according to geographic location (United <span class=\"nowrap\">States/Canada</span> 7.3 percent; Europe 9.1 percent; Latin America 13.3 percent); however, following adjustment for confounding variables, these differences are often reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. All-cause mortality in patients with CAP is as high as 28 percent within one year. Given the aging population in North America, it is expected that the burden of CAP will increase.

HCAP referred to pneumonia acquired in healthcare facilities such as nursing homes, hemodialysis centers, and outpatient clinics or a hospitalization within the past three months. The rationale for the separate designation of HCAP (and its association with HAP) was that patients with HCAP were thought to be at higher risk for MDR organisms. However, several studies have shown that many patients defined as having HCAP are not at high risk for MDR pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>], and that this designation is not a good predictor of who will have an infection with an MDR organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, although interaction with the healthcare system is potentially a risk for MDR pathogens, underlying patient characteristics are also important independent determinants of risk for MDR pathogens and mortality. It is anticipated that patients previously designated as HCAP will be included in the next update of the Infectious Diseases Society of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(IDSA)/American</span> Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines because patients with HCAP frequently present from the community and are initially cared for in emergency departments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lungs are constantly exposed to particulate material and microbes that are present in the upper airways and, by microaspiration, enter the lower respiratory tract. Contrary to longstanding belief, the lower respiratory tract is not sterile. Using culture-independent techniques, investigators have shown that healthy lower airways contain some bacterial species that are also found in the upper respiratory tract, such as <em>Prevotella</em> spp, <em>Veilonella</em> spp, and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, pulmonary host defenses are important for maintaining the microbiome at low levels and devoid of conventional pathogens. These host defenses can be categorized as innate (nonspecific) or acquired (specific). The development of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) indicates either a defect in host defenses, exposure to a particularly virulent microorganism, or an overwhelming inoculum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. It is noteworthy that newer culture-independent techniques correlate well with conventional culture techniques in patients with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Microaspiration is the most common mechanism through which the constituents of the microbiota and pathogens reach the lung.

Most cases of CAP in which an organism is identified are caused by one of only four or five microorganisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63248\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63248 \">table 2</a>), but the distribution of pathogens varies with the clinical setting. A microbiologic diagnosis was confirmed in 38 to 87 percent of cases of CAP in studies that used specialized tests to detect various pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/5,6,32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,32-36</a>] but in a lower percentage of cases in studies that did not used specialized tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63248\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63248 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In clinical practice, an etiologic agent is identified even less frequently. As an example, in a review of 17,435 cases of CAP in the Medicare database for United States emergency departments, an etiologic diagnosis was reported in only 7.6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The true prevalence of the various etiologic agents in CAP is uncertain. Studies investigating the etiology of CAP have been performed in different regions, in various patient populations and clinical settings, and using a variety of microbiologic techniques. Because direct culture of infected lung tissue requires invasive techniques, studies primarily use laboratory tests that provide indirect evidence of etiology. These indirect methods include sputum cultures (which may be contaminated with oropharyngeal flora), blood cultures, polymerase chain reaction, urinary antigen tests, and serology. Studies that used serologic testing may have overestimated the incidence of CAP caused by specific pathogens, such as <em>M. pneumoniae</em> and <em>C. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/32-35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35,40</a>], since positive serologic results may represent recent infection rather than active infection. In addition to the use of indirect methods, interpretation of the results is hampered by the failure to identify an organism in a large proportion of cases and the frequency of mixed infections.</p><p>Despite these problems, studies have identified some consistent trends and conclusions regarding the etiology of CAP in adults, which are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>S. pneumoniae</em> has been the most commonly detected bacterial species in most studies. However, the detection of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> from patients with CAP in the United States has declined significantly, likely due in part to the use of pneumococcal vaccines in adults and the universal use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children (leading to herd immunity).

Since respiratory virus can be present in the upper airways without causing illness, studies using multiplex PCR may overestimate the frequency of viruses as a cause of CAP. Using PCR, nasopharyngeal swabs are positive for respiratory tract viruses in 20 to 30 percent of healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Influenza remains the clinically most significant viral cause of CAP in adults; other common viral pathogens include RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and adenovirus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63248\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63248 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

A possible reason for this is that rhinovirus and coronavirus were not causing the pneumonia but impairing upper airway defenses so that pathogens can establish themselves in the lower respiratory tract. In another study, bacterial coinfection was associated with approximately 40 percent of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

In addition to possibly predisposing patients to infections with other organisms, the presence of a respiratory virus may also represent prolonged shedding (especially in immunocompromised hosts), upper respiratory tract infection, or colonization.</p><p>However, some studies have suggested that viruses like rhinovirus are likely to play a pathogenic role in CAP in adults. As an example, one study evaluated whether viruses are detected in the nasopharynx by PCR more commonly in patients with pneumonia than in asymptomatic individuals sampled at the same time and in the same geographic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Viruses were detected rarely in asymptomatic adults but frequently in adults with CAP (2.1 versus 24.5 percent). Viruses were detected more often in both asymptomatic children (24.4 percent) and children with CAP (68.8 percent) compared with adults. Detection of influenza, RSV, and hMPV were rare in asymptomatic adults and children. Associations of rhinovirus and adenovirus with CAP varied with age. Asymptomatic rhinovirus detection declined with increasing age. This led to a strong association of rhinovirus with CAP in adults, a more modest association in older children, and no association in younger children. In children, RSV and hMPV were highly associated with CAP. Adenovirus in the nasopharynx was only associated with CAP in children &lt;2 years of age but not in older children.</p><p>In a study of 259 patients with a pneumonia syndrome, 44 viruses were detected in 42 patients: 26 (16.2 percent) had rhinovirus, 7 had coronavirus, 4 had parainfluenza virus, 3 had RSV, 1 had hMPV, and 1 had influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

It is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adult patients and those with significant comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall rate of CAP ranges from 8 to 15 cases per 1000 persons per year; the highest rates are at the extremes of age. There is seasonal variation, with more cases occurring during the winter months. The rates of pneumonia are higher for men than for women and for black persons compared with Caucasians. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lungs are constantly exposed to particulate material and microbes that are present in the upper airways and, by microaspiration, enter the lower respiratory tract. Contrary to longstanding belief, the lower respiratory tract is not sterile. Healthy lower airways contain some bacterial species that are also found in the upper respiratory tract, such as <em>Prevotella</em> spp, <em>Veilonella</em> spp, and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. The development of CAP indicates either a defect in host defenses, exposure to a particularly virulent microorganism, or an overwhelming inoculum. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to microbial virulence factors, diseases and conditions in the host may lead to impairment of pulmonary defense and increased risk of CAP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52808 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing host conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presenting clinical manifestations cannot reliably differentiate between different etiologies, but there are a few epidemiologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical clues that can be helpful and must be taken into account when considering the etiology of CAP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52808 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiologic clues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are more than 100 microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) that can cause CAP. Most cases of pneumonia are caused by one of only four or five microorganisms. The most commonly identified pathogens depend in part upon the severity of illness as judged by the site of care (outpatient versus inpatient versus intensive care unit) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72014 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many studies of patients with CAP, bacteria have been the most commonly detected organisms. The true incidence of these infections is uncertain because of the difficulty in distinguishing colonizing organisms from pathogens. <em>S. pneumoniae </em>is the most commonly identified bacterial cause of CAP. However, it has decreased markedly due to pneumococcal vaccines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72014 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63248\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63248 \">table 2</a>).

Influenza is the most significant viral cause of CAP in adults. Mixed viral-bacterial infection is relatively common. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Viruses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungal infection is an unusual cause of CAP in the immunocompetent patient, but certain fungi (eg, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Coccidioides</em> spp) can cause pneumonia in immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients who reside in or have visited endemic areas. The specific epidemiology of some fungal infections is therefore important as a diagnostic clue.
