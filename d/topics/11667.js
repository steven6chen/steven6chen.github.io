Some advanced CT and MRI technologies are able to distinguish between brain tissue that is irreversibly infarcted and that which is potentially salvageable, thereby allowing better selection of patients likely to benefit from therapy. The use of this technology is dependent upon availability, and its role in guiding treatment decisions is still under study.</p><p>Neuroimaging during the acute phase (first few hours) of an ischemic stroke will be reviewed here. Other aspects of the acute evaluation of stroke, the clinical diagnosis of various types of stroke, and the subacute and long-term assessment of patients who have had a stroke are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main advantages of CT are widespread access and speed of acquisition. In the hyperacute phase, a noncontrast CT (NCCT) scan is usually ordered to exclude or confirm hemorrhage; it is highly sensitive for this indication. A NCCT scan should be obtained as soon as the patient is medically stable. The presence of hemorrhage leads to very different management and concerns than a normal scan or one that shows infarction. Immediate CT scanning of all patients with suspected stroke is also the most cost-effective strategy when compared with alternate strategies such as scanning selected patients or delayed rather than immediate imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The utility of CT for acute stroke has been enhanced by the advent of additional CT techniques including CT perfusion imaging (CTP) and CT angiography (CTA). Multimodal CT evaluation that employs the three techniques (NCCT, CTA, and CTP) combined shows improved detection of acute infarction when compared with NCCT evaluation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In addition, multimodal evaluation that includes CTA and CTP may permit assessment of the site of vascular occlusion, infarct core, salvageable brain tissue and degree of collateral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Early signs of infarction on noncontrast CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity of standard noncontrast CT for brain ischemia increases after 24 hours. However, in a systematic review involving 15 studies where CT scans were performed within six hours of stroke onset, the prevalence of early CT signs of brain infarction was 61 percent (standard deviation <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Early signs of infarction include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoattenuation involving one-third or more of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical sulcal effacement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal parenchymal hypoattenuation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of the insular ribbon or obscuration of the Sylvian fissure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperattenuation of large vessel (eg, &quot;hyperdense MCA sign&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of gray-white matter differentiation in the basal ganglia</p><p/><p>The presence of early CT signs of infarction implies a worse prognosis. In the systematic review, the presence of these signs was associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome (odds ratio 3.11, 95% CI 2.77-3.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Hyperdensity of the MCA, indicating the presence of thrombus inside the artery lumen (bright artery sign), can be visualized on noncontrast CT in 30 to 40 percent of patients with an MCA distribution stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. This finding is highly specific for MCA occlusion, although it may be less useful for predicting outcome than the other early CT signs.</p><p>While early CT signs of infarction are associated with a worse outcome, it remains unclear whether early infarction signs should be considered when deciding whether to use intravenous (IV) thrombolytic treatment for acute ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An analysis from the NINDS trial found that early CT signs of infarction were not independently associated with increased risk of adverse outcome after IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (tPA) treatment, and patients treated with alteplase did better whether or not they had early CT signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke#H2187332181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Alteplase'</a>.)</p><p>Careful attention to the presence of these signs by experienced personnel is necessary; mistakes have occurred in up to 20 percent of cases in a controlled setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Studies that have examined the ability of neurologists, neuroradiologists, and general practitioners have found that early infarction can be very difficult to recognize on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the importance of a truly normal head CT in acute stroke should not be underestimated; it excludes major ischemic damage with high specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Standardized methods such as ASPECTS have been developed to aid recognition of early ischemia because of the known difficulty in detecting such changes. In addition, accentuating the contrast between normal and edematous (ischemic) brain tissue by variable window width and center level settings may improve detection of early ischemic change on noncontrast CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ASPECTS method of assessing ischemic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Alberta stroke program early CT score (ASPECTS) was developed to provide a simple and reliable method of assessing ischemic changes on head CT scan in order to identify acute stroke patients unlikely to make an independent recovery despite thrombolytic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The ASPECTS value is calculated from two standard axial CT cuts; one at the level of the thalamus and basal ganglia, and one just rostral to the basal ganglia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72190 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63480\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63480 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The score divides the MCA territory into 10 regions of interest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcortical structures are allotted three points (one each for caudate, lentiform nucleus, and internal capsule).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MCA cortex is allotted seven points.

The following observations were made for baseline values.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASPECTS was inversely correlated with stroke severity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median ASPECTS value was 8; a value of 7 or less was associated with a sharp increase in dependence and death at three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASPECTS predicted functional outcome and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, with good sensitivity and specificity for functional outcome (0.78 and 0.96) and for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (0.90 and 0.61).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inter- and intraobserver reliability was good to excellent; score reliability appears to be good when performed in real time by treating physicians as compared with expert readers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>In a prospective study of 100 patients with acute ischemic stroke, the ability to detect early ischemic changes by ASPECTS was similar on noncontrast CT and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>ASPECTS has been retrospectively applied to baseline and 24-hour CT scans for patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion who were randomized to intraarterial thrombolysis or placebo in the PROACT-II study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Treated patients with a baseline ASPECTS &gt;7 had a risk ratio (RR) of 3.2 (95% CI 1.2-9.1) for an independent functional outcome, while patients with ASPECTS &le;7 had a RR of 1.0 (95% CI 0.6-1.9).</p><p>Despite its promise, the available data suggest that ASPECTS analysis of noncontrast CT does <strong>not</strong> identify patients who may benefit from thrombolysis. The prospective CASES observational cohort study of 1135 patients treated with IV tPA found that each one point decrement in the baseline ASPECTS scores was associated with a lower probability of independent functional outcome (odds ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the ASPECTS score was not a predictor of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients treated within the standard three-hour time window.</p><p>Subsequent reports showed that the ASPECTS score of baseline noncontrast CT scans from the NINDS and ECASS-II tPA stroke studies was not associated with a statistically significant modification of tPA treatment effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This finding is in agreement with a report cited above from the NINDS cohort, which found that signs of early ischemic change on CT were not independently associated with increased risk of adverse outcome after IV tPA treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Early signs of infarction on noncontrast CT'</a> above.)</p><p>One problem with ASPECTS may be that the various types of parenchymal changes on noncontrast CT considered to represent early ischemic change may actually have different pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that hypoattenuation represents irreversible infarction, whereas focal swelling may represent penumbral tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. ASPECTS may have greater accuracy for detection of ischemic change and for identifying final infarct volume when used to analyze CTA-source images and the contrast CT images obtained from CTP than when used to analyze noncontrast CT images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Utility of CT contrast'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'CT perfusion imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>It is important to note that ASPECTS is not applicable to lacunar stroke, brainstem stroke, or any stroke outside of the middle cerebral artery territory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Utility of CT contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spiral (helical) CT and new generation multidetector CT scanners increase scan speed and allow CTA of both extracranial and intracranial cerebral arteries. The speed of these CT units also offers CTP capabilities. These scans can be performed immediately after conventional CT scanning, requiring only 5 to 10 minutes of additional time. In practice, one can perform both CTA and CTP during the same examination, with separate contrast boluses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Advantages of these fast CT scans include the ability to rapidly identify patients with occlusion of the major vessels within the circle of Willis or extracranial cerebral arteries, as well as the ability to evaluate the perfusion status of the brain parenchyma. Additional information about brain perfusion can be obtained by post imaging analysis of the raw data (or source images) of CTA and CTP studies. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'CT angiography'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'CT perfusion imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">CT angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CTA is performed by administering a rapid bolus of standard intravenous CT contrast through a large bore intravenous line in the antecubital fossa. The helical CT scan is timed to capture the arrival of contrast into the brain. Contrast can be seen in the great vessels on the raw CT images; these serve as data for three dimensional computer reconstructions of the circle of Willis and extracranial cerebral arteries. Clot causes a filling defect in the vessel on CTA, which often can be seen on the raw images (also called source images). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the detection of intracranial large vessel stenosis and occlusion, CTA in various studies had sensitivities of 92 to 100 percent and specificities of 82 to 100 percent when compared with conventional angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The accuracy of CTA for the diagnosis of extracranial carotid stenosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;, section on 'CT angiography'</a>.)</p><p>Recanalization rates for intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis differ depending upon the site of arterial occlusion. CTA has become the standard of practice in our center to triage patients between intravenous thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, and intra-arterial thrombolysis. It is also helpful in diagnosing stroke mimics. As an example, the patient with severe brainstem signs thought due to basilar thrombosis who has a normal basilar artery on CTA demands an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pial artery collateral vessels of the brain can be assessed using multiphase CTA, which acquires blood flow information in three phases after contrast injection; the first phase consists of conventional CTA with image acquisition from the aortic arch to skull vertex during the peak arterial phase; the second and third phases consist of image acquisition from the skull base to vertex during the mid-venous and late-venous phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Compared with perfusion CT, advantages of this method include whole brain coverage, reduced vulnerability to patient motion, no need for additional contrast or postprocessing, and more rapid determination of collateral status. In the ESCAPE trial, the presence of moderate-to-good pial collateral circulation, determined by multiphase CTA in a majority of subjects, was one of the criteria used to select patients for mechanical thrombectomy in the setting of acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial artery occlusion in the anterior circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke#H308372312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">CTA source images</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CTA source images can provide an estimate of perfusion by taking advantage of the contrast enhancement in the brain vasculature that occurs during a CTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], potentially obviating the need for a separate CT perfusion study and a second contrast bolus. CTA source images typically cover the entire brain, in contrast to CT perfusion source images that are limited to a few brain slices.</p><p>During a CTA, contrast fills the brain microvasculature in the normal perfused tissue that is accessible to the blood pool and appears as increased signal intensity on the CTA source images. In distinction, contrast does not fill the microvasculature in ischemic brain regions that are less accessible to the blood pool and have poor collateral flow. These ischemic areas are easily seen as regions of hypoattenuation (low density or dark) on CTA source images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54188\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54188 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>CTA source images are more sensitive than noncontrast CT scans for the detection of early brain infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/31,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37</a>]. Hypoattenuation on CTA source images correlates with ischemic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and with the abnormality on diffusion-weighted MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this sense, CTA source images (or raw images of CT perfusion studies) can be considered as a surrogate for DWI. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diffusion-weighted imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">CT perfusion imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using an intravenous bolus of CT contrast, a whole brain &quot;perfused blood volume map&quot; can be obtained by timing the scan to the passage of the contrast through the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This can be obtained by continuing to scan the brain during a CT angiogram or by using a new bolus of contrast following the CTA. However, CTP requires repeatedly scanning the same portion of the brain parenchyma over the time required for the bolus to pass through the vasculature.</p><p>Similar to CTA-SI, the source images of the CTP (CTP-SI) are available for analysis. As with CTA-SI, areas of hypoattenuation on CTP-SI should correlate with ischemic brain regions. In addition, quantitative analysis of the kinetics of a bolus of CT contrast passing through the brain enable estimation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and the mean transit time (MTT) that it takes blood to flow through the tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thresholds of CBF and CBV can be used to predict whether tissue will die or survive, but standardized, reliable, and validated thresholds have not been definitively established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>One study found that the ASPECTS method applied to CTP-SI or CBV maps was more accurate for identifying irreversible ischemia and clinical outcome than ASPECTS applied to noncontrast CT or CTA-SI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, ASPECTS applied to CBF maps or MTT appeared to identify the maximal extent of infarction in the absence of major reperfusion, and the difference between CTP-SI (or CBV) and CBF (or MTT) on ASPECTS appeared to identify ischemic tissue at risk for infarction. Thus, ASPECTS applied to CTP and its multiple parametric maps (CBF, CBV, MTT) holds promise for improving patient selection for intravenous thrombolysis of acute ischemic stroke, and for extending the time window beyond three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/30,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,43</a>]. However, this hypothesis should be confirmed in randomized clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced MRI imaging techniques have the potential for further defining stroke subgroup populations that may benefit from intravenous thrombolysis or interventional vascular treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, MRI sequences using high susceptibility methods, such as gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences, are equivalent to CT for the detection of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and better than CT for the detection of chronic hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].

These MRI techniques may obviate the need for emergent CT in centers where brain MRI is readily available. As an example, one specialized stroke center found that routine use of these MRI sequences to screen patients prior to intravenous thrombolysis for suspected ischemic stroke was practical and safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Furthermore, MRI screening did not cause excessive treatment delays or lead to worse outcomes.

This problem can be overcome by use of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ADC provides a quantitative measure of the water diffusion. In acute ischemic stroke with cytotoxic edema, decreased water diffusion in infarcted tissue causes increased (hyperintense) DWI signal and a decreased ADC, visualized as hypointense signal on ADC maps of the brain. In contrast, vasogenic edema may cause increased DWI signal may occur due to T2 shine through, but water diffusion is increased, and increased ADC is seen as hyperintense signal on ADC maps.</p><p>The decrease in ADC in the region of the infarct is a necessary transition on the way to infarction. The decrease in diffusion in the infarct is transient, lasting one to two weeks.

MRI has an advantage in the very early detection of ischemia with DWI imaging, and it reliably detects hyperacute hemorrhage with proper sequences including high susceptibility images.</p><p>Advances in the use of CT angiography (CTA) source images and CT perfusion imaging (CTP) suggest that CT techniques are increasingly able to provide crucial information regarding early ischemia and perfusion lesions in hyperacute stroke assessment. CT remains indispensable in the frequent circumstance where there are contraindications to MRI such as pacemakers and patient intolerance due to anxiety or motion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain imaging and a comprehensive neurovascular evaluation should be obtained for most patients suspected of having acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Neurovascular imaging is important in acute stroke to determine the potential sources of embolism or low flow in ischemic stroke and to detect possible aneurysms or vessel malformations in hemorrhagic stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain imaging is required to guide the selection of acute interventions to treat patients with stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain imaging in acute ischemic stroke can be obtained with either noncontrast head CT or conventional MRI. Both imaging techniques can be used to exclude acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain MRI with diffusion imaging is superior to noncontrast CT for the detection of acute ischemia and the exclusion of some stroke mimics. However, at present there are no data to show that MRI is superior to CT for selecting patients who could be treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> [tPA]). Thus, MRI should be used rather than CT only if it does not unduly delay treatment with intravenous alteplase in an eligible patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where available, assessment of ischemic brain injury and brain perfusion status with either diffusion and perfusion MRI or with contrast CT source images and perfusion CT should be performed if the findings are likely to influence treatment decisions, such as acute thrombolysis or endovascular interventions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurovascular imaging should assess the extracranial (internal carotid and vertebral) and intracranial (internal carotid, vertebral, basilar, and Circle of Willis) large vessels. Noninvasive methods are preferred unless urgent endovascular therapy is planned. MR angiography (MRA), CTA, or the combination of ultrasound methods (Duplex and transcranial Doppler [TCD]) can be used. Conventional angiography is usually reserved for situations where acute intraarterial thrombolysis is being considered and for follow-up when noninvasive studies are inconclusive. Availability and expertise at individual centers is a major factor in the choice of the initial noninvasive neurovascular studies. A detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of these studies for the diagnosis of carotid artery disease is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular imaging should not delay treatment with intravenous tPA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>) for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Useful methods include CTA, time-of-flight MRA, and contrast enhanced MRA. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography is useful for assessing the aortic arch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The brain imaging and neurovascular studies should not be considered in isolation, but rather as one part of the acute stroke evaluation.
