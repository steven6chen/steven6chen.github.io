It may or may not be associated with menstrual periods. Chronic pelvic pain may be a symptom caused by one or more different conditions, but in many cases is a chronic condition due to abnormal function of the nervous system (often called &quot;neuropathic pain&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of gynecologic, gastrointestinal, urologic, musculoskeletal and body-wide disorders can cause chronic pelvic pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gynecologic causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecologic causes are thought to be the cause of chronic pelvic pain in about 20 percent of women. In some groups of women, gynecologic causes of pelvic pain are even more common. Some of the gynecologic causes of pelvic pain include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometriosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tissue lining the inside of the uterus is called the endometrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue is also present outside of the uterus. Some women with endometriosis have no symptoms, while others experience marked discomfort and pain and may have problems with fertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infertile-couple-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Evaluation of the infertile couple (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2668975192\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine fibroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibroids, also called leiomyomas, are growths in the uterus. They are not cancerous. While not everyone with fibroids experiences symptoms, some women do have pelvic pain, heavy periods, or fertility problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4111755210\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenomyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a condition in which endometrial tissue (the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus) grows inside the uterine walls. It causes an enlarged uterus and heavy, painful periods, and often affects women who also have endometriosis or uterine fibroids. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Endometriosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2668975192\" class=\"local\">'Uterine fibroids'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic inflammatory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic inflammatory disease is an acute infection usually caused by a sexually transmitted organism. Occasionally, it is caused by a ruptured appendix, tuberculosis, or diverticulitis. It can involve the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes (which link the ovaries and uterus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). Chronic changes following pelvic inflammatory disease occur in about one-third of women and causes chronic pelvic pain. The reason for this is not clearly known, but is likely because of permanent damage to the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, and is not because of a chronic infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10350391\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic adhesive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adhesions refer to abnormal tissue that causes internal organs or structures, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes, to adhere or stick to one another. Adhesions are not scar tissue, as adhesions are abnormal reactions to surgery, infection, or inflammation, and are not normal healing like scar tissue. It is very controversial whether adhesions cause pelvic pain and medical experts are not in agreement. However, most evidence suggests that surgery for pelvic adhesive disease does not relieve pelvic pain in most women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-gynecologic causes of chronic pelvic pain may be related to the digestive system, urinary system, or to pain in the muscles and nerves in the pelvis:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Irritable bowel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (such as loose stools, more frequent bowel movements with onset of pain, and pain relieved by defecation) in the absence of any specific cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritable-bowel-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Irritable bowel syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Painful bladder syndrome and interstitial cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painful bladder syndrome and interstitial cystitis <span class=\"nowrap\">(PBS/IC)</span> are the terms given to bladder pain that is not caused by infection. Symptoms usually include the need to urinate frequently (frequency) and a feeling of urgently needing to urinate (urgency). Some women with painful bladder syndrome have lower abdominal or pelvic pain in addition to urinary tract symptoms. A separate topic review is available that discusses <span class=\"nowrap\">PBS/IC</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Diverticulitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diverticulum is a sac-like protrusion that sometimes forms in the muscular wall of the colon (or intestine). Diverticulitis occurs when diverticula become inflamed. This usually causes abdominal pain; nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms can also occur. Diverticulitis most often causes acute abdominopelvic pain and is not a common cause of chronic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diverticular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diverticular disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic floor pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction may include pelvic pain, pain with urination, difficulty urinating, constipation, pain with intercourse, or <span class=\"nowrap\">frequent/urgent</span> urination. Pelvic floor dysfunction can be diagnosed by a clinician feeling the pelvic floor muscles (muscles that support the pelvic organs and hips) through the vagina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rectum; muscles that feel tight, tender, or band-like indicate that pelvic floor dysfunction could be contributing to pelvic pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24187354\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal myofascial pain (trigger points)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain can originate from the muscles of the abdominal wall due to myofascial pain. This problem usually has small localized areas of abnormal tenderness of the abdominal muscles that are called trigger points. Abdominal myofascial pain is diagnosed by the clinician examining the abdominal muscles for trigger points; often tightening of these muscles while they are examined causes increased pain and assists in diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibromyalgia is one of a group of chronic pain disorders that affect connective tissue structures, including muscles, ligaments, and tendons. It is characterized by widespread muscle pain (or &quot;myalgia&quot;) and tenderness in certain areas of the body. Women with fibromyalgia may also experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, headaches, and mood disturbances such as depression and anxiety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3644292859\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical, sexual, or mental abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pain in general appear to have a higher incidence of prior physical or sexual abuse, and the same appears to be true for women who experience chronic pelvic pain. Do not be afraid to tell your health care provider if you have ever been, or are currently being, hurt by someone, or if you feel unsafe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF THE CAUSE OF CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because a number of different conditions can cause chronic pelvic pain, it is sometimes difficult to pinpoint the specific cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history and a physical examination of the abdomen and pelvis are essential components of the work-up for women with pelvic pain. In particular, the examination should include the lower back, abdomen, hips, and pelvis (internal examination).</p><p>Laboratory tests, including a white blood cell count, urinalysis, tests for sexually transmitted infections, and a pregnancy test may be recommended, depending upon the results of the physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some diagnostic procedures may also be helpful in identifying the cause of chronic pelvic pain. As an example, a pelvic ultrasound examination is accurate in detecting pelvic masses, including ovarian cysts (sometimes caused by ovarian endometriosis) and uterine fibroids. However, ultrasound is not helpful in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, or painful bladder syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A surgical procedure called a laparoscopy may be helpful in diagnosing some causes of chronic pelvic pain such as endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease. Laparoscopy is a procedure that is often done as a day surgery. Most women are given general anesthesia to induce sleep and prevent pain. A thin telescope with a camera is inserted through a small incision just below the navel. Through the telescope, the surgeon can see the contents of the abdomen, especially the reproductive organs. If the laparoscopy is normal, the physician can then focus the diagnostic and treatment efforts on non-gynecologic causes of pelvic pain.</p><p>If the laparoscopy is abnormal (eg, areas of endometriosis or abnormal tissue are seen) these areas may be treated or biopsied during the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COPING WITH CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological counseling may be offered to help women manage their pelvic pain. There are several types of psychosocial support:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy involves meeting with a psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker to discuss emotional responses to living with chronic pain, treatment successes or failures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> personal relationships. Psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be helpful in many people with chronic pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group psychotherapy allows people to compare their experiences with chronic pelvic pain, overcome the tendency to withdraw and become isolated in pain, and support one another's attempts at more effective management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Online or local support groups that deal with chronic pain may also be helpful, such as the American Chronic Pain Association (<a href=\"https://theacpa.org/&amp;token=TakZSqyZLIgXQPCW+N/fg8LAL/d7Dm/65bKGtgi2XMo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">theacpa.org</a>) and the American Academy of Pain Management (<a href=\"http://www.aapainmanage.org/links/Links.php&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfEfaCslUh3S2MMxgz2rLOeb28+QDjuwgFVZtfzpVnrD+rwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=8406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.aapainmanage.org/links/Links.php</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation techniques can relieve musculoskeletal tension, and may include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, self-hypnosis, or biofeedback.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pelvic pain has multiple possible treatments that can be combined if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One approach to managing women with chronic pelvic pain is to prescribe sequential drug treatments for disorders that are the most likely causes of the patient's pain. As an example, endometriosis is the most common gynecological cause of chronic pelvic pain. If endometriosis seems a likely diagnosis based upon the history and physical examination, then a medical therapy for endometriosis is given for a trial period. If this is not successful, then a trial of another medical therapy is initiated. If one of these treatments relieves the pelvic pain, then the likelihood that endometriosis is the cause of pain increases. However, it is important to note that improvement in symptoms is not absolute confirmation of a diagnosis since treatment effects are often not specific. As an example, hormonal treatment of endometriosis may also improve pelvic congestion syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, or interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different approach is to use intensive diagnostic testing in an attempt to identify the specific cause of the patient's pain, if possible, before starting specific therapy. Although therapy targeted specifically to the patient's diagnosis might appear ideal, arriving at a diagnosis may involve costly laboratory and imaging tests, and often requires procedures including laparoscopy, cystoscopy, and bowel endoscopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third option is treatment directed at the nerves that cause pain symptoms rather than at a specific diagnosis. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsive medications are often used to modulate the activity of nerve fibers that trigger and transmit the pain signal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic floor physical therapy (PT) is often helpful for women with abdominal myofascial pain and with pelvic floor pain. This type of PT aims to release the tightness in these muscles by manually &quot;releasing&quot; the tightness; treatment is directed to the muscles in the abdomen, vagina, hips, thighs, and lower back. Physical therapists who perform this type of PT must be specially trained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management clinics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If medications are not effective in treating the pain, a woman may be referred to a medical practice specializing in pain management. Pain services utilize multiple treatment modalities including</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biofeedback and relaxation therapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve stimulation devices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of tender sites with a local anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, Marcaine)</p><p/><p>Pain services can help women who are on opioids or narcotics for pain management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few causes of gynecologic pelvic pain can be treated surgically. For example, some women benefit from surgical removal of their endometriosis.</p><p>Hysterectomy may alleviate chronic pelvic pain, especially when it is due to uterine disorders such as adenomyosis or fibroids. However, pain can persist even after hysterectomy, particularly in younger women (those less than 30) and in women with a history of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or pelvic floor dysfunction. Hysterectomy is not a good choice for the management of chronic pelvic pain in women who have not completed their family. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgery to cut some of the nerves in the pelvis (presacral neurectomy) has also been studied as a treatment for chronic pelvic pain. However, this approach has shown effectiveness mostly for endometriosis pain and has additional surgical risks, so it is not recommended for most women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=8406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
