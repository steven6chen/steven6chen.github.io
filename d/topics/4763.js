It is different from either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, but shares features of both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The primary cause is a relative insulin deficiency related to destruction of pancreatic islets. Insulin resistance also may play a role, especially in association with acute exacerbations or chronic progression of pulmonary disease.</p><p>Development of CFRD is associated with worse lung function, poorer nutritional status, and more chest infections. In addition, longitudinal studies have demonstrated decreased survival (sixfold) in individuals with CFRD as compared with non-diabetic CF patients, with females at particularly high risk in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Importantly, insulin treatment improves lung function and nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The addition of insulin treatment and glucose monitoring, however, adds substantially to the burden of treatment, and therapeutic targets may need to be modified to maximize benefit.</p><p>Several important management guidelines have been published. These provide recommendations on screening, diagnosis, and management. Available guidelines include American Diabetes Association and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF, 2010) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]; International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD, 2014) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; Australian standards of care for CFRD (2014) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; and United Kingdom Cystic Fibrosis Trust (2004) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1238597052\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below). Key recommendations contained within these guidelines are discussed across various parts of this monograph.</p><p>The pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of CFRD is discussed in this topic review. Other aspects of CF are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Investigational therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711144116\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is now the most common nonrespiratory complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) encountered among individuals school-aged and older, as shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97530\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97530 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711146319\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevalence of CFRD increases markedly with age. The best prevalence data initially came from a CF center in Minnesota where routine annual screening using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in patients six years and older since the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Prevalence of CFRD was 2 percent in children 10 years and younger, 19 percent in individuals 11 to 17 years, 40 percent in those ages 18 to 29 years, and 45 to 50 percent in those over age 30 years. In a separate report from Germany and Austria, prevalence of CFRD was 11 percent at 20 years and 25 percent at 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This analysis did not include patients on glucocorticoids or who had had lung transplants; such patients would be expected to have higher risk for CFRD.</p><p>Awareness of CFRD has been increasing, and with increased awareness comes increased detection of CFRD. An Australian review found that reported incidences of CFRD had increased tenfold between 2000 and 2008, from 2.0 to 22.1 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, reports from the United States Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) patient registry annual report indicated that 17 percent of patients over 13 years of age required chronic insulin therapy in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In 2012, the registry documented that 20 percent of patients had CFRD, rising to 34 percent of those over 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These reported increases in CFRD diagnosis probably reflect better screening practices <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> longer lifespan of CF patients, rather than a true increase in CFRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Some studies report substantially lower prevalence (eg, in the Irish CF registry only 5.7 percent of children had CFRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]), but case ascertainment issues may compromise accuracy with registry-based data analysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711144387\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CFRD is caused by progressive damage to the pancreas. As a result, the strongest risk factors are markers for CF-related pancreatic disease. The risk factors include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic insufficiency &ndash; CFRD mainly occurs in people with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. However, it is important to realize that CFRD has been reported in 6 percent of patients with relatively normal pancreatic exocrine function (pancreatic sufficient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe genotype &ndash; CFRD is more common in individuals with severe CF genotypes, including delta-F508 (pF508.del) homozygotes, which are associated with pancreatic insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased age &ndash; Risk for CFRD increases dramatically with age, as outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H711144116\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender &ndash; The prevalence of CFRD is higher among women, at least after 30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Moreover, among patients with CFRD, women have reduced pulmonary function and survival as compared with men, and this may contribute toward the overall reduced lifespan observed for women with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H711146726\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung function &ndash; CFRD is associated with greater decline in lung function (typically measured as forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]) and more frequent pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In many cases, a marked decline in lung function precedes the diagnosis of CFRD and improves after insulin therapy, suggesting impaired pulmonary function is a consequence rather than a cause of CFRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H711146714\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired <span class=\"nowrap\">nutrition/growth</span> &ndash; CFRD is more common among individuals with poor nutritional status. This may be explained in part by direct effects of CFRD on nutritional status. However, some of the association may be attributable to indirect effects of the severe genotype, pancreatic insufficiency, and other complications on nutritional status. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease &ndash; CFRD is more common among individuals with CF-related liver disease. This is probably attributable to associations between CF-related liver disease and other CFRD risk factors, but a direct effect of CF-related liver disease on glucose metabolism is also possible. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711144238\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182820402\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of impaired glucose tolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary abnormality predisposing to cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is slowly progressive insulin deficiency due to destruction of pancreatic tissue. Abnormal chloride channel function results in thick viscous secretions, causing obstructive damage to the exocrine pancreas with progressive fibrosis and fatty infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Disruption and destruction of islet architecture leads to loss of endocrine beta, alpha, and pancreatic polypeptide cells. </p><p>The initial stages of the disease are characterized by insulin deficiency, manifested by impaired first-phase insulin secretion in response to stimulant agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In later stages of the disease or during acute pulmonary exacerbations, CFRD also has a component of insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The insulin resistance may be caused by increases in growth hormone and cortisol, and increased catecholamines and inflammatory cytokines during acute pulmonary exacerbations. </p><p>The early stage of CFRD is characterized by hyperglycemia in response to a glycemic load. In later stages, the disease tends to progress to fasting hyperglycemia (FH), at which point hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) rises above the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, post-prandial hyperglycemia is the earliest and most sensitive marker of CFRD, and HbA1c has relatively low sensitivity but does become elevated in the later phases of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H17626658\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>Secondary mechanisms contributing to diabetes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients include malabsorption, liver dysfunction, and therapies such as glucocorticoids (typically used for treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) and immunosuppressant therapy following lung transplantation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711144499\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences from type 1 diabetes mellitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of important differences between CFRD and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97525 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Importantly, CFRD is only rarely associated with islet autoantibodies or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II types that are seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], (although classic type 1 diabetes mellitus has been described in CF patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Thus, the beta-cell dysfunction seen in CFRD does not appear to have an autoimmune mechanism. Moreover, ketoacidosis rarely occurs in CFRD. Some overlap with type 2 diabetes mellitus is suggested by increased risk of CFRD in those with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Several unique aspects of CF influence glucose metabolism and are not commonly encountered in other forms of diabetes. These include malnutrition, acute and chronic infection, glucagon deficiency, malabsorption, abnormal intestinal transit time, liver dysfunction, increased work of breathing and elevated energy expenditure, and exposure to some CF treatments that can precipitate glucose intolerance, such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants following <span class=\"nowrap\">lung/liver</span> transplantation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711144811\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical consequences of CFRD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a growing body of evidence showing that hyperglycemia and insulin insufficiency have detrimental impacts on clinical outcomes in patients with CF, even before formal diagnostic criteria for CFRD are met.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711146714\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies suggest detrimental effects of CFRD on both lung function and nutrition. A longitudinal study followed 152 CF subjects with varying degrees of glucose intolerance or CFRD, but without FH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At baseline, 45 percent of the patients had normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 39 percent had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 16 percent had CFRD without FH (CFRD-no FH). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced vital capacity (FVC), and body mass index (BMI) were comparable among these groups. However, over the four-year follow-up, an overall decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC occurred. The highest rates of decline for FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC occurring among the group with the most impaired glucose tolerance (CFRD-no FH). Subjects in the lowest quartile for insulin production at baseline experienced the highest rates of pulmonary function decline over time, suggesting a relationship between insulin deficiency and clinical deterioration. Similarly, data from the Swedish registry of CF subjects over the age of seven years described a greater rate of lung function decline in CFRD subjects compared with non-CFRD subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Laboratory studies suggest that elevated glucose levels on the airway surface promote bacterial growth and cause an exaggerated but less effective inflammatory response, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed association between CFRD and pulmonary function. One study demonstrated that subjects with CFRD had elevated airway glucose levels, as measured by nasal glucose monitoring, as compared with subjects without CFRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Moreover, <em>in vitro</em> studies demonstrated that increased glucose exposure enhanced bacterial growth of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</em> with significant changes occurring at far lower levels than those documented in CF subjects. A separate study in a mouse model of CF showed that airway hyperglycemia was associated with impaired ability to clear bacteria from the lung, despite enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other effects of hyperglycemia include increased lactate generation and efflux, which acidify the airway surface liquid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and a deleterious effect on transepithelial ion transport and epithelial repair functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The airway glucose barrier is regulated by insulin and is dysfunctional in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>CF patients undergoing lung transplantation have more complications and a higher mortality rate if they have preceding CFRD as compared with those without CFRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is hoped that with lower targets and earlier treatment of diabetes, these differences in outcome will diminish.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711146720\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CFRD is associated with poor nutritional status, and particularly with a decline in nutritional status prior to its diagnosis. The nutritional impact of CFRD can be explained by the fact that insulin is a potent anabolic hormone that plays an important role in maintaining body weight and lean body mass. Insulin deficiency promotes a catabolic state with detrimental effects on nutritional outcomes. As an example, patients with CFRD (without FH) experienced a decline in BMI of 0.3 &plusmn; 0.21 units during an observation period, and this was reversed after the initiation of insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Detrimental effects of CFRD also have been shown in milder CFRD categories. In a cohort of CF subjects with normal glucose tolerance (as defined by the oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]), subclinical deficiencies of insulin secretion were detected by measuring the area under the curve for insulin secretion over the 120 minutes of the OGTT, and greater impairment in insulin secretion was associated with the lowest BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Similarly, another study demonstrated that abnormalities in glucose homeostasis prior to the development of overt CFRD were associated with preceding declines in weight Z-score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8304222\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple reports have demonstrated that CFRD is associated with significant microvascular complications, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy, which depend on disease duration and glycemic control. Diabetic gastroenteropathy including gastroparesis also occurs in CFRD and may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms. Because the understanding and management of CFRD is still rapidly evolving, the precise prevalence of these complications and their responsiveness to treatment are not well established. &#160;</p><p>As an example, in a large cohort of patients with CFRD, peripheral neuropathy and symptoms consistent with diabetic gastroenteropathy were each seen in 52 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This frequency of neuropathy and diabetic gastroenteropathy was similar to that in patients with longstanding type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Among those with FH, 16 percent had retinopathy and 14 percent had nephropathy (indicated by moderately elevated albuminuria). These frequencies were somewhat lower than for type 1 diabetes, but the complications tended to appear at lower levels of HbA1c [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Separate case reports have described severe retinopathy in individuals with CFRD and poor glycemic control, with proliferative retinopathy complicated by blindness despite laser therapy to the retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other reports from CF clinics have also described peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy, which were generally associated with poor glycemic control and arose after 10 years of diabetes duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Antibiotic use also may contribute to the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Regular screening for microvascular complications is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H8304734\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for complications'</a> below.) </p><p>Macrovascular disease also occurs in CFRD, although it is uncommon. Myocardial disease has been found at postmortem examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and symptomatic myocardial infarction has been described in a few case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Noninvasive measures of arterial stiffness, as a marker of large vessel disease, are higher in patients with CF and CFRD as compared with non-CF controls, without increases in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], supporting the notion that CFRD increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711146726\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CFRD has been associated with increased mortality, especially in female subjects, and this detrimental effect is greatly attenuated by early diagnosis and treatment. One report described the clinical course of 872 CF patients treated at a single center in Minnesota during three consecutive intervals: 1992 to 1997, 1998 to 2002, and 2003 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Mortality in patients with CFRD significantly decreased over time, as did overall mortality. In female subjects, the mortality rate halved from 6.9 to 3.2 deaths per 100 patient-years between the first and last study periods; in male subjects the mortality rate dropped from 6.5 to 3.8 deaths per 100 patient-years. An analysis of patient data from 2008 to 2012 found that the mortality rate of individuals with CFRD was still 3.5 times greater than those without CFRD, suggesting that aggressive CFRD screening and management has yet to show the expected benefit in mortality rates of older CF subjects (&gt;30 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, early diagnosis and effective treatment for patients with CFRD eliminated the gender gap in mortality, and also narrowed the gap in mortality between CF patients with and without diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711147053\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As outlined above, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is often clinically silent, but increases morbidity and mortality, and these effects can be attenuated by early diagnosis and treatment.

It is possible that screening will be extended to younger children in the future; some centers already begin screening around six years of age because abnormal glucose tolerance at this age predicts early progression to CFRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The emergence of abnormal glucose tolerance may occur even earlier, and was detected in almost 40 percent of CF subjects between three months and five years of age at one CF center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Screening should be performed during a period of baseline health (ie, not during a pulmonary exacerbation), using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as discussed below.

This has been confirmed across several studies. HbA1c is often normal, regardless of the degree of hyperglycemia. In one study, only 16 percent of CF patients had elevated HbA1c values at the time of CFRD diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. If HbA1c is measured, a value &ge;6.5 percent is consistent with a diagnosis of CFRD, as for other types of diabetes. The possibility of screening with HbA1c using a lower threshold of 5.8 percent has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], but this test still performs poorly for diagnosis in comparison with OGTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Even lower thresholds may be appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical Symptoms</strong> &ndash; Symptoms are not a good method for screening for CFRD. In a population of pediatric CF patients in Toronto, only 2.7 percent were clinically recognized as having CFRD, but on OGTT testing of asymptomatic adolescents (aged 10 to 18 years), 17 percent were found to have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 13 percent had CFRD (without fasting hyperglycemia [FH]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In this cohort, abnormal glucose tolerance was almost exclusively found in those with pancreatic insufficiency and severe (class 1 to 3) mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. </p><p/><p>Tests that may be useful for identifying early stages of abnormal glucose intolerance (high sensitivity; clinical utility unclear): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous glucose monitoring </strong>&ndash; Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has not been formally established as a screening procedure for CFRD, but studies suggest that this method can identify early abnormalities in glucose tolerance that are not detected by OGTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], as illustrated by the following examples: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One study compared CF subjects with normal OGTT results and normal body weight with age-matched controls (mean age 27 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 22.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Compared with controls, the individuals with CF had postprandial hyperglycemia. On OGTT, plasma glucose values at 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the glucose load were higher than in controls. On CGM, the mean glucose was higher (106 versus 92 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.9 versus 5.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> and a larger proportion had glucose excursions into &quot;diabetic range&quot; over 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (33 versus 5 percent).

At present, CGM should be considered in patients whose clinical course suggests the possibility of CFRD but the OGTT result is normal. Formal glucose thresholds identifying risk of CFRD have been proposed but require further validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insulin concentrations during OGTT</strong> &ndash; Measurements of insulin concentrations during the OGTT can detect early abnormalities of insulin secretion, which is the hallmark of CFRD. This was shown in a study that compared insulin secretion during a standard OGTT in individuals with CF and normal or IGT (as determined by plasma glucose measurements during the OGTT), compared with individuals without CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. In the individuals with CF, the peak insulin concentrations were lower and occurred later (insulin peak two hours after glucose load, compared with 30 to 60 minutes in the control). Glucagon responses to stimulation by intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> were blunted, suggesting defects in function of alpha as well as beta cells of the pancreas.

It is performed using a glucose load of 1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight (up to a maximum of 75 grams). Plasma glucose concentrations should be measured in the fasting state, and both one and two hours after the glucose load. The one-hour measurement is important to detect indeterminate glucose tolerance (INDET), an earlier stage of abnormal glucose tolerance, in which this midpoint value is elevated but the two-hour level is not. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711146819\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of OGTT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) represents one end of a spectrum of abnormalities of glucose tolerance in cystic fibrosis (CF).

Patients with CFRD are often subcategorized by the absence or presence of FH because FH usually represents a more advanced stage of disease and is associated with microvascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, because treatment is beneficial for patients with and without FH, distinguishing between these groups may not affect clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8,9,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,41</a>]. </p><p>The plasma glucose threshold for the diagnosis of CFRD is based on the plasma glucose concentrations at which intervention has been shown to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The prediabetic categories (INDET and IGT) are included in the classification system for CF patients in recognition that the plasma glucose threshold that corresponds to pulmonary deterioration and increased mortality is not yet known. The clinical significance of these categories will become more apparent as comprehensive data becomes available, describing the natural history of CFRD and its pulmonary, nutritional, and microvascular complications. (See <a href=\"#H711144811\" class=\"local\">'Clinical consequences of CFRD'</a> above.)</p><p>A single, abnormal OGTT may not indicate the need for treatment, but identifies patients with abnormal glucose tolerance (INDET or IGT) and the need for close monitoring. Close monitoring may include repeating the OGTT sooner than the planned annual screen, intensive monitoring of blood glucose during pulmonary infections, and attention to changes in nutritional or pulmonary status, which often signal the onset of CFRD. While there is a general trend from INDET to frank CFRD with FH, fluctuation between severity stages may occur. The OGTT result may vary over time, as illustrated in a four-year study that showed deterioration of glucose tolerance in 22 percent and improvement of glucose tolerance in 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Insulin therapy may also be considered on a case-by-case basis, for subjects with evidence of milder dysglycemia (eg, indeterminate glycemia [INDET] or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) if this appears to be causing polyuria, polydipsia, nutritional decline, or deterioration in lung function. Although insulin treatment has important benefits, it also adds substantially to the burden of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment. The treatment burden is an important factor when deciding whether to start treatment for patients with INDET or IGT, and when choosing among insulin regimens.</p><p>For patients with established CFRD, we recommend initiating insulin therapy because this clearly has beneficial effects on nutrition, and probably improves pulmonary function and survival. In a randomized trial, adult patients with CFRD without FH gained 0.39 &plusmn; 0.21 body mass index (BMI) units during one year of insulin therapy, which reversed the BMI decline that they had experienced during the year prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] (see <a href=\"#H711146720\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional status'</a> above). Among the insulin-treated subjects, there was a trend toward slower rate of decline in pulmonary function compared with the rate of decline prior to treatment; insulin-treated subjects also tended to have a slower overall decline in pulmonary function compared with placebo-treated subjects, but neither of these findings reached statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Multiple small observational studies with one to three years follow-up confirm improvements in BMI after initiation of insulin therapy, and also document improvements in pulmonary function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), or reductions in acute pulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5,73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,73-76</a>]. As an example, among 42 young adults with CFRD, insulin therapy slowed the annual rate of decline for FEV<sub>1</sub>, delaying the decline by an average of 34 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CFRD-associated mortality was described in an observational study from a single center and documented progressively lower mortality rates over a 20-year period, which narrowed the gap in mortality between CF patients with and without diabetes, and eliminated the gender gap in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Because the center progressively improved protocols for early identification and treatment of CFRD, this study provides indirect evidence that insulin therapy reduces CFRD-associated mortality. (See <a href=\"#H711146726\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with INDET or IGT, we suggest insulin therapy for selected patients. In our practice, we initiate insulin therapy for selected patients with INDET or IGT if there is an acute decline in nutritional status or lung function, or symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria or polydipsia).

The reason for higher insulin dose in this cohort is not clear, as mean HbA1c was 7.1 percent in adolescents less than 21 years, comparable with the 6.9 percent achieved in another large cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>At our institution, we vary the insulin regimen depending on the patient's characteristics and response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97532%7EPEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97532 graphicRef61880 \">table 3A-B</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early in the course of disease, a single daily basal insulin injection usually can achieve desired outcomes and has lower treatment burden than regimens that include multiple daily insulin injections. In our practice, we initiate insulin therapy with a long-acting insulin analogue (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-detemir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin detemir</a> in the morning) at 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span>. We then increase the dose by increments of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg,</span> aiming for postprandial blood glucose &lt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> without hypoglycemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&lt;3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> occurs prior to the midday meal, then we split the dose of detemir to two-thirds in the morning and one-third in the evening, and increase the dose. If fasting hypoglycemia develops and postprandial hyperglycemia persists, then we add a prandial bolus prior to meals, while reducing the dose of basal insulin. The prandial bolus is a rapid-acting insulin, with a starting dose of 0.5 units per 15 grams carbohydrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hospitalizations and when glucocorticoids are used, the starting dose for basal insulin is generally 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span>.

Blood glucose needs to be checked at four to five hours after commencement and at the end of feeds to titrate the dose. Alternately, intermediate-acting insulin can be given mixed with short-acting insulin before feeds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps can provide better matching of carbohydrate to insulin requirements, especially during overnight feeds. Square wave boluses and dual wave boluses can help control blood glucose levels. Substantially more insulin is needed for meals than for basal insulin requirements. &#160;</p><p/><p>For surgical procedures such as port insertions, insulin usually can be withheld without risk of significant hyperglycemia. CFRD is rarely associated with ketoacidosis, so risk of developing ketosis during periods without insulin is very low. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17626719\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet and drinks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with CF benefit from dietary strategies to increase caloric intake, including calorie-rich beverages. However, for patients with CFRD or abnormal glucose tolerance (INDET or IGT), beverages with high carbohydrate loads such as carbonated soft drinks and juices will add to the glycemic burden and increase insulin needs. Therefore, patients with any degree of abnormal glucose tolerance are optimally managed with a diet with low glycemic load, including avoidance of high-sugar beverages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In CFRD subjects where glycemic control remains challenging despite efforts to optimize insulin, strategies such as increased intake of low glycemic index carbohydrate, reduction of foods with high glycemic index (eg, soft drinks), and distribution of carbohydrate evenly throughout the day may help optimize blood glucose control without compromising total caloric intake.</p><p>Other than these considerations for glycemic load, dietary goals are identical to those for all patients with CF, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8,29,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,29,82</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liberal intake of total energy (calories) &ndash; typically 120 to 150 percent or more of the estimated energy requirement for age and sex, targeting BMI &ge;50<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex.

Less frequent but staggered SMBG monitoring to provide an overall picture of glucose control may be suitable in selected patients. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preprandial blood glucose &ndash; SMBG should be performed prior to meals (fasting), especially during periods of illness or changes in insulin dosing, and routinely during periods of baseline health. Target fasting blood glucose is 70 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> when on basal insulin. If preprandial hypoglycemia is detected, the basal insulin dose should be decreased. Preprandial testing is important because spontaneous hypoglycemia is common among individuals with CF, even in the absence of insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CF patients are prone to hypoglycemia in the fasting state because of malnutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased energy needs, and also to postprandial hypoglycemia (reactive hypoglycemia), due to delayed and disordered insulin secretion.

Patients on insulin therapy should be educated about the risks and management of hypoglycemia, including the use of glucagon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postprandial blood glucose &ndash; SMBG also should be performed one to two hours after meals. If hyperglycemia is detected, the basal insulin dose should be increased or a prandial dose of rapid-acting insulin should be added; the goal is to maintain postprandial blood glucose in the normal range (&lt; 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. More frequent SMBG may be needed after changes in insulin dose, or during acute illness. Postprandial testing is important to maximize the benefit of insulin therapy on pulmonary function, and the optimal time point for testing may be one hour after meals. This was suggested by a study of young adolescents with CF in good baseline health, in which the one-hour glucose excursion on OGTT was negatively associated with lung function; this was not the case for the two-hour stimulated value, which is typically used to make the diagnosis of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17626732\"><span class=\"h4\">Hemoglobin A1c</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although HbA1c is not recommended as a screening test for CFRD, it is helpful in monitoring treatment, and should be measured every three months in patients on insulin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The goals and glycemic targets for CFRD differ from those used for type 1 diabetes:</p><p>For patients with CFRD, we suggest trying to maintain HbA1c as low as possible, ideally in the lower part of the normal range (eg, HbA1c &lt;5.5 percent). This target is selected to optimize lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations. At diagnosis, patients with CFRD often have HbA1c in the non-diabetic range (&lt;6 percent) or in the borderline dysglycemic range (6 to 6.5 percent). In part, this is because HbA1c is affected by the shorter lifespan of red blood cells in chronic disease. If the HbA1c increases above the baseline level (measured prior to insulin therapy), the insulin dose usually should be increased. In one study, good CFRD control (defined in this study as HbA1c &lt;7 percent) was not associated with fewer pulmonary infections, but it is possible that a benefit would have been found if a more stringent HbA1c threshold had been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>By contrast, in type 1 diabetes, treatment goals are to achieve HbA1c &lt;7.5 percent for adolescents and &lt;7 percent in adults, according to the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD). This is because the primary goals of treatment for type 1 diabetes are to reduce risks for microvascular complications, and to avoid acute episodes of hyper- and hypoglycemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17626746\"><span class=\"h4\">Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CGM provides frequent measurements of glycemia and insight about insulin needs and responsiveness. In theory, if CGM helps to avoid blood glucose excursions above the normal range, this may improve lung function. In clinical practice, CGM can be useful for patients whose CFRD is difficult to manage through standard approaches, such as those with poor growth despite insulin therapy. CGM has been validated in patients with CF and is comparable with non-CF diabetic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Its prevalence among people with CF increases markedly with age, rising to almost 50 percent in those over age 30 years. Other risk factors for developing CFRD include severe genotype (eg, pF508.del homozygotes), pancreatic insufficiency, and female sex. (See <a href=\"#H711144116\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and natural history'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary abnormality predisposing to CFRD is slowly progressive insulin deficiency due to fibrosis and atrophy of pancreatic tissue. Acute pulmonary exacerbations tend to further impair glucose tolerance and may trigger CFRD because inflammatory cytokines and catecholamines promote insulin resistance.

Screening should be performed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), during a period of baseline health. Measurements of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) should not be used for screening because this test has low sensitivity for CFRD. In addition to annual screening described above, monitoring of blood glucose is suggested during acute pulmonary exacerbations and for patients on enteral tube feedings. Women with CF who are pregnant or planning pregnancy warrant increased vigilance and screening for CFRD.
