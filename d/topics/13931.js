It accounts for about 5 percent of office gynecology visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>All postmenopausal women with unexpected uterine bleeding patients should be evaluated for endometrial carcinoma since this potentially lethal disease will be the cause of bleeding in approximately 10 percent (range 1 to 25 percent, depending upon risk factors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the most common cause of bleeding in these women is atrophy of the vaginal mucosa or endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the early menopausal years, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and submucosal fibroids are also common etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding will be reviewed here. Evaluation and management of premenopausal women with vaginal bleeding is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding occurs in approximately 4 to 11 percent of postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The incidence of bleeding appears to correlate with time since menopause, with the likelihood of bleeding decreasing over time. As an example in a study that asked 271 postmenopausal women to complete a daily record, the estimated incidence of bleeding fell from <span class=\"nowrap\">409/1000</span> person-years immediately after the first 12 months of amenorrhea following menopause to <span class=\"nowrap\">42/1000</span> person-years more than three years after menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal bleeding noted in the genital area is usually attributed to an intrauterine source, but may actually arise from the cervix, vagina, vulva, or fallopian tubes, or be related to ovarian pathology. The origin of bleeding can also involve nongynecologic sites, such as the urethra, bladder, <span class=\"nowrap\">anus/rectum/bowel,</span> or perineum. Cervical stenosis may inhibit egress of blood from the uterine cavity; hematometra may result.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of bleeding in postmenopausal women is less broad than that for abnormal bleeding in premenopausal women since the various causes of anovulation are not relevant. In a study of 1220 consecutive women with uterine bleeding, all cancers were diagnosed in&nbsp;postmenopausal (7 percent) or perimenopausal (1 percent) women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among the 454 (37 percent) postmenopausal women, final diagnoses included: carcinoma (6.6 percent); atypical hyperplasia (0.2 percent); hyperplasia without atypia (2.0 percent); polyp (37.7 percent); fibroid (6.2 percent); <span class=\"nowrap\">proliferative/secretory</span> (14.5 percent); <span class=\"nowrap\">hypotrophy/atrophy</span> (30.8 percent). </p><p>By comparison, two studies determined the background prevalence of endometrial pathology in asymptomatic postmenopausal women by evaluating gynecologically asymptomatic breast cancer patients prior to administration of adjuvant therapy. Both studies reported the baseline risk of an endometrial abnormality in this group was 17 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As with symptomatic women, the most common abnormalities were atrophy and polyps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoestrogenism causes atrophy of the endometrium and vagina. In the uterus, the collapsed, atrophic endometrial surfaces contain little or no fluid to prevent intracavitary friction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This results in microerosions of the surface epithelium and a subsequent chronic inflammatory reaction (chronic endometritis), which is prone to light bleeding or spotting.</p><p>Classic vaginal findings of atrophy include a pale, dry vaginal epithelium that is smooth and shiny with loss of most rugation. If inflammation is present, additional findings may include patchy erythema, petechiae, blood vessels visible through the thinned out epithelium, friability, bleeding, and discharge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 to 10 percent of women with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding have endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/2,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-17</a>]. The incidence of cancer as a cause of uterine bleeding increases with increasing age and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is the most common genital cancer in women over 45 years of age. </p><p>A model that used clinical history alone to predict the risk of endometrial cancer in post- or peri-menopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding found that nulliparous women over the age of 70 with diabetes mellitus had an 87 percent risk of complex hyperplasia or endometrial cancer compared to 3 percent in women without these characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sarcomas of the uterus constitute only 3 to 5 percent of all uterine tumors and may present with postmenopausal bleeding. These cancers arise from the stroma of the endometrium (endometrial stromal sarcomas) or the myometrium. They may look and feel like benign leiomyomas. Endometrial histology may be normal; diagnosis requires a hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine sarcoma: Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fallopian tube or ovarian cancer can cause postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Cervical and vaginal cancers typically present with vaginal bleeding. Vulvar cancers are not associated with bleeding until they are advanced. (Refer to individual topic reviews for each cancer.)</p><p>Choriocarcinoma is a rare cause of uterine bleeding in menopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyps are benign endometrial growths of unknown etiology that are a common cause of perimenopausal and early postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Growth of polyps can be stimulated by estrogen therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal hormone therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many postmenopausal women who take estrogen therapy develop vaginal bleeding; the frequency depends upon the regimen used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Endometrial monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrial hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial hyperplasia may manifest clinically as uterine bleeding. Since postmenopausal women should be estrogen deficient, endometrial hyperplasia at this time is abnormal and requires an explanation. Endogenous estrogen production from ovarian or adrenal tumors or exogenous estrogen therapy are possible causes. Obese women also have high levels of endogenous estrogen due to the conversion of androstenedione to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> and the aromatization of androgens to estradiol, both of which occur in peripheral adipose tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyomata uteri</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyomata uteri (fibroids) are the most common pelvic tumors in women. The prevalence in postmenopausal women is one-tenth that of premenopausal women, thus they are a potential, but uncommon, cause of uterine bleeding in menopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The diagnosis of a uterine sarcoma should be considered in postmenopausal women with presumed uterine leiomyomas producing symptoms; the incidence of sarcoma is higher in this group, but is still small. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine sarcoma: Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenomyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomyosis is a benign histologic finding of the uterus in which endometrial glands are infiltrating into the myometrial wall. It can cause pain and menorrhagia during the reproductive years. The diagnosis may be suspected by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, but can only be confirmed by pathologic examination following hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Symptomatic adenomyosis does not occur after menopause in the absence of postmenopausal hormone therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease in adjacent organs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation of neighboring organs, such as diverticulitis, can occasionally cause a corresponding inflammation of the female upper genital tract. A ruptured sigmoid diverticulum may fistulize into the uterus and present as uterine bleeding, discharge, and endometritis.</p><p>Diseases of the urethra (eg, urethritis), bladder (eg, cancer or urinary tract infection), and bowel (eg, inflammatory bowel disease or hemorrhoids) may cause bleeding that is mistaken for genital tract bleeding. These disorders should be considered and evaluated for in patients with bleeding in whom there is no obvious genital tract etiology. A radiograph of the pelvis to rule out fracture should be considered when there is genital bleeding after trauma, especially in a postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Post radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding can be a late effect of radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Obliterative endarteritis and the vascular narrowing of aging and arteriosclerosis lead to devascularization of the radiated tissues. Tissue necrosis causes viscus perforation, tissue sloughing, and bleeding. Hemorrhagic cystitis and proctitis can lead to significant blood loss. Vaginal vault necrosis may cause uncontrolled bleeding and pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of anticoagulants may cause uterine bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10674615\"><span class=\"h2\">Herbal and dietary supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soy and other phytoestrogens in large doses may be associated with stimulation of the endometrial lining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. One series reports the association of soy with polyp and leiomyoma growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A randomized trial of 376 postmenopausal women who received soy versus placebo showed a significant increase in endometrial hyperplasia over a five-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometritis is an uncommon cause of postmenopausal bleeding. In the developing world, however, endometrial tuberculosis may present as postmenopausal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometritis-unrelated-to-pregnancy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometritis unrelated to pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Tuberculous endometritis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal in the diagnostic evaluation of postmenopausal women with uterine bleeding is to exclude malignancy since age is a significant risk factor for this disorder.</p><p>The following discussion applies only to women who are <strong>NOT</strong> taking postmenopausal hormone therapy. The evaluation and management of abnormal bleeding in women who are taking hormone replacement is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Endometrial monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information that is important in the history includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When did the bleeding start?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were there precipitating factors, such as trauma?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the nature of the bleeding (temporal pattern, duration, postcoital, quantity)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any associated symptoms such as pain, fever, or changes in bladder or bowel function?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the medical history and are any medications being taken (eg, hormones, anticoagulants)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are any soy-containing herbal or dietary supplements being taken?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of breast, colon, and endometrial cancer?</p><p/><p>The answers to these questions may help to direct the clinician toward one of the major categories of abnormal bleeding: neoplasm; atrophy; medication; foreign body. As an example, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> are risk factors for endometrial cancer; vaginal dryness and soreness with dyspareunia and bleeding after intercourse suggest atrophy; and a foreign body may be the source of bleeding in a woman who uses a pessary.</p><p>The patient&rsquo;s body mass index (BMI) should be calculated, since obesity is a risk factor for endometrial cancer (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). </p><p>Thorough physical examination of the external and internal anatomy of the female genital tract is important. The focus of the evaluation is to determine the bleeding site; to note any suspicious lesions, lacerations, or foreign bodies; and to assess the size, contour, and tenderness of the uterus. Lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, exocervix) causes of bleeding can usually be excluded by a normal physical examination.</p><p>In addition, a general examination should be performed to look for signs of systemic illness (eg, hepatitis, renal disease, splenomegaly).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasound can be used as an initial test for evaluating the endometrium. A detailed discussion of these tests for evaluation of the endometrium can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest endometrial biopsy as the initial diagnostic test for women with postmenopausal bleeding due to its high sensitivity, low complication rate, and low cost. If a cause for the bleeding is determined, then further management depends upon the clinical diagnosis. However, endometrial biopsy is not a sensitive technique for diagnosing structural abnormalities, such as polyps.</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound examination is an acceptable initial test as an alternative to endometrial sampling in postmenopausal women who cannot tolerate office biopsy and in women in whom evaluation for uterine pathology (eg, polyp, leiomyoma) or of the adnexa is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Endometrial cancer can reasonably be excluded by ultrasound in postmenopausal women with a thin (&le;4 mm), homogeneous endometrium. Endometrial biopsy is required if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endometrial lining is thicker than 4 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endometrium shows diffuse or focal increased echogenicity (heterogeneity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endometrium is not adequately visualized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The woman has persistent bleeding.</p><p/><p>Persistent bleeding can be a sign of endometrial cancer even when the endometrial thickness is less than 4 to 5 mm since a thin or indistinct endometrial stripe does not reliably exclude type 2 endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Therefore, women with persistent bleeding should be evaluated further.</p><p>The evaluation of women with (1) insufficient or nondiagnostic tissue from a biopsy procedure, or (2) persistent bleeding (despite a normal endometrial biopsy or thin endometrium on ultrasound examination) is discussed in detail separately.

All women need cervical cancer screening as part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding, as it can be difficult to distinguish between endocervical and upper uterine bleeding. Any visible lesion needs to be biopsied, even if the cytology is normal.
