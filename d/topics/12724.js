While individual mind and body practices differ in their historical foundations, many features and goals of the today's mind-body practices overlap. Exact definitions have proved challenging and controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Yoga practice has changed substantively since its origins in ancient India as a philosophy focusing on expansion of consciousness, release from suffering, and omniscience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Modern yoga is a more physical practice that strives to improve many different aspects of physical and mental health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21016851\"><span class=\"h2\">Components of modern yoga</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern yoga has three main components: <span class=\"nowrap\">postures/poses</span> (&#257;sanas), breath <span class=\"nowrap\">control/regulated</span> breathing (pr&#257;n&#257;y&#257;ma), and <span class=\"nowrap\">meditation/relaxation</span> (samyana). Chanting may also be included. While combinations of breath control, meditation, and chanting without postures are sometimes considered to be yoga, these practices do not fulfill most definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Postures/poses</span> (&#257;sanas)</strong> &ndash; Postures did not become one of the cornerstones of yoga practice until the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Since then, hundreds of different yoga postures have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98025 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98028\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98028 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Many postures are easy and similar to stretching exercises. Others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98028\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98028 \">picture 2</a>) may be more difficult to perform safely.

In yoga, this breath control is called Pranayama, from the words &quot;pr&#257;n&#257;y,&quot; referring to release from suffering, and &quot;&#257;ma&quot; referring to a body of techniques for regulating and stilling the breath to calm the mind [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It most common form is slow, deep diaphragmatic breathing: about six breaths per minute with sequential mobilization of the diaphragm, lower chest, and upper chest. Such breath control is also a form of meditation or a preparation for deep meditation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Meditation/relaxation</strong></span> &ndash; Meditation was the first component of yoga and is also a part of Hinduism and Buddhism.

These vary in types, intensity, and emphasis on postures, breath control, or meditation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some styles also include chanting, aspects of spirituality, and varied environmental conditions such as temperature (eg, Bikram yoga). Yoga teachers may supplement their classes with philosophy and advice on how to best maintain health and treat disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Commonly practiced styles include Iyengar, Vinyasa, and Kripalu.

Yoga therapists often work one-on-one with individual patients. A more advanced set of educational standards and competencies have been established for the training of yoga therapists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-yoga/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The minimum requirement for certification as a yoga therapist is 800 hours, beyond a 200-hour teacher training program.

Yoga practitioners are less likely to be minorities and uninsured.
