The most common extrauterine location is the fallopian tube, which accounts for 96 percent of all ectopic gestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55800%7EOBGYN%2F62515\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55800 graphicRef62515 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Management of these pregnancies has changed dramatically over the years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Preferred management is pharmacologic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, rather than surgery. It is important to remember, however, that hemorrhage from ectopic pregnancy is still the leading cause of pregnancy-related maternal mortality in the first trimester and accounts for 4 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths, despite improved diagnostic methods leading to earlier detection and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites of ectopic pregnancy will be reviewed here.

This risk is related to both the underlying tubal disorder that led to the initial ectopic pregnancy and to the choice of treatment procedure. History of salpingostomy for ectopic pregnancy is a risk factor for recurrent ectopic pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 3.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic inflammatory disease and other genital infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic infection (eg, nonspecific salpingitis, chlamydia, gonorrhea), especially recurrent infection, is a major cause of tubal pathology and, therefore, increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic infection may alter tubal function and may also cause tubal obstruction and pelvic adhesive disease. Some data suggest that a history of chlamydial infection results in the production of a protein (PROKR2) that makes a pregnancy more likely to implant in the tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The rising incidence of ectopic pregnancy is strongly associated with an increased incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Women with a history of PID have an approximately threefold increased risk of ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective population-based cohort of women ages 15 to 44 years in Denmark (1995 to 2012), a positive test for chlamydia was associated with an increase in risk of ectopic pregnancy by 31 percent (adjusted hazard ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.25-1.38) compared with women with a negative test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The risk of ectopic pregnancy is high after tubal reconstructive surgery, and the outcome depends upon the function and condition of the tube, type of surgery, and surgeon's expertise. Rates of ectopic pregnancy after tubal reconstructive surgery range widely, from 3 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In one series of 1800 surgically treated cases, the distribution of sites was ampullary (70 percent), isthmic (12 percent), fimbrial (11.1 percent), ovarian (3.2 percent), interstitial (2.4 percent), and abdominal (1.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Tubal pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of tubal pregnancies, but they are generally believed to be the result of (1) conditions that delay or prevent passage of the fertilized oocyte into the uterine cavity or (2) factors inherent in the embryo that result in premature implantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2605603948\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of tubal pregnancy have detected several factors that may impact blastocyst implantation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathology findings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic salpingitis &ndash; Tubal pathology, particularly chronic salpingitis, is observed in up to 90 percent of surgical specimens of tubal pregnancies. Chronic salpingitis is six times more common in tubes containing an ectopic pregnancy than in normal tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The histologic features of chronic salpingitis are attenuation and blunting of the plicae and infiltration of the tubal wall by plasma cells and lymphocytes. In a study of 231 women with ectopic pregnancy, transvaginal sonography showed an adnexal abnormality in nearly 95 percent of the patients, most commonly a nonspecific adnexal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salpingitis isthmica nodosa &ndash; Salpingitis isthmica nodosa is noted in approximately 10 percent of women with a tubal pregnancy. The gross appearance of salpingitis isthmica nodosa is bilateral nodularities in the isthmic portion of the tube. Histologically, the tubal mucosa penetrates into the myosalpinx, leading to hypertrophy of the surrounding muscular layers. The etiology of salpingitis isthmica nodosa is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The depth of implantation of the gestational sac varies according to the location of the ectopic pregnancy within the fallopian tube. A histopathologic study of 84 tubal pregnancies found that the gestational sac was inside the tubal lumen in one-half of ampullary pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The muscularis of the tube was preserved in most of these cases. By comparison, the gestational sac was usually detected extraluminally or both inside and outside the lumen in isthmic pregnancies and the disruption of the tubal wall was more extensive. This suggests that the trophoblast penetrates the tubal wall relatively early in isthmic pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum or extracellular factors &ndash; A number of factors (eg, lectin, integrin, matrix-degrading cumulus, prostaglandins, growth factors, cytokines, and modulator proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]) may cause premature implantation in the tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embryonic factors &ndash; Embryonic cardiac activity was seen in fewer than 10 percent of tubal gestations in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Fetal chromosomal and anatomic abnormalities have been found as well. However, chromosomal abnormality is probably not an important etiology of ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Interstitial or cornual pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interstitial portion of the fallopian tube is the proximal segment that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus. A pregnancy implanted at this site is called an interstitial pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921 \">figure 1</a>); the term cornual pregnancy is also widely used to describe a pregnancy at this location. Originally, the term cornual pregnancy referred only to pregnancies implanted in either the horn of a bicornuate uterus, a rudimentary horn of a unicornuate uterus, or in the lateral half of a septated or partially septated uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Interstitial pregnancies may be misdiagnosed as intrauterine because they are partially implanted in the endometrium. A clue to correct diagnosis is its eccentric location and thin (less than 5 mm) myometrial mantle. Contrary to previous belief, rupture of interstitial pregnancy occurs relatively early in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;, section on 'Interstitial pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>These pregnancies are uncommon, comprising about 2 to 3 percent of all ectopic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The risk factors are similar to those for other tubal pregnancies, except for ipsilateral salpingectomy which is a risk factor that is specific to interstitial pregnancy.</p><p>The following types of pregnancies are intrauterine pregnancies but are often mistaken for an interstitial pregnancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rudimentary uterine horn pregnancy &ndash; A rudimentary horn pregnancy is not an ectopic pregnancy, but an intrauterine pregnancy that is located in the rudimentary uterine horn of a unicornuate uterus. The term cornual pregnancy was originally used to refer exclusive to either this location of a gestation or one located in the horn of a bicornuate uterus, as noted above. However, such pregnancies have a high risk of uterine rupture. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;, section on 'Obstetrical complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angular pregnancy &ndash; Angular pregnancy is an intrauterine pregnancy with a clinical course distinct from interstitial pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The pregnancy is implanted medial to the uterotubal junction in the lateral angle of the uterine cavity, close to the proximal ostium of the fallopian tube. In contrast with an interstitial pregnancy, an angular pregnancy is located medial to the round ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When viewed from the exterior of the uterus during laparoscopy or laparotomy, the uterine enlargement caused by an angular pregnancy displaces the round ligament superiorly and laterally, while remaining medial to the ligament itself. On the other hand, an interstitial pregnancy causes an enlargement of the uterus that is lateral to the round ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Angular pregnancy appears to be rare and there are few reports regarding its diagnosis or management. In a classic review of a series of 39 angular pregnancies, the rate of spontaneous abortion was 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Uterine rupture has rarely been reported with this type of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/44,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058583490\"><span class=\"h3\">Heterotopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterotopic pregnancy refers to the combination of an intrauterine pregnancy and a concurrent pregnancy at an ectopic location. The estimated incidence of heterotopic pregnancy is dependent upon the rates of ectopic pregnancy and dizygotic twinning. The incidence has been rising, mainly due to the increasing number of pregnancies derived from assisted reproductive technology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-pregnancy-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-and-heterotopic-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal pregnancy, cesarean scar pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1105309140\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine ectopic sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pregnancy may implant in the uterus but at a depth or location that is not consistent with a full-term pregnancy, and may result in life-threatening rupture of the uterine wall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Hysterotomy scar pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectopic pregnancy in a previous hysterotomy (cesarean) scar occurs in about 1 in 2000 pregnancies and 6 percent of ectopic pregnancies among women with a prior cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. It does not appear to be related to the number of cesarean deliveries. The pregnancy is located in the scar outside of the uterine cavity and surrounded by myometrium and connective tissue. Implantation in this location is believed to occur because the embryo migrates through a defect within the scar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Previous injury to the myometrium including myomectomy could be the predisposing factor. It has also been described in conjunction with adenomyosis. The diagnosis is usually difficult due to different locations inside the uterus and the varying degrees of uterine involvement. Intramural pregnancy must be distinguished from cervical and cesarean scar pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3806799489\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cervical pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy in which the trophoblast implants in the cervical tissue of the endocervical canal.

In contrast to tubal pregnancy, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease or the use of an intrauterine contraceptive device does not increase the risk of ovarian pregnancy.
