Premenopausal women treated with alkylating agents are also at risk of development of hypogonadotropic amenorrhea.</p><p>This topic review will address management of menorrhagia related to chemotherapy. Ovarian failure related to anticancer drugs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three potential cancer-related causes of uterine bleeding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding directly from a genitourinary neoplasm (eg, endometrial carcinoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, cervical cancer)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia induced by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the malignancy itself (eg, acute promyelocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (eg, acute promyelocytic leukemia)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common menstrual manifestation of bleeding diathesis is menorrhagia; bleeding between periods is less common. Menorrhagia refers to excessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding occurring at regular intervals. It is technically defined as blood loss greater than 80 mL per cycle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> menstrual periods lasting longer than seven days. Indirect indicators of menorrhagia include passing of blood clots (which suggests that the naturally fibrinolytic properties of the uterus are overwhelmed by a heavy volume of bleeding), anemia, and signs or symptoms of volume depletion during the menstrual period.</p><p>A diagnosis of menorrhagia secondary to chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia can be made in thrombocytopenic women when other causes of abnormal uterine bleeding have been excluded. Most such women have a platelet count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL,</span> which is the level of thrombocytopenia associated with an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding.</p><p>All women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be evaluated to determine the cause; the clinician should not assume that the bleeding is a side effect of chemotherapy. The evaluation should include a careful examination of the lower genital tract to rule out any lesions, cervical cytology (but if the patient is experiencing heavy bleeding this may not be possible), and possibly an endometrial biopsy to rule out endometrial pathology. Since many women with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia are also leukopenic, some clinicians avoid endometrial biopsy as the procedure may increase the risk of infection. A pelvic imaging study, such as pelvic ultrasound, can be helpful in identifying gynecologic causes of uterine bleeding, such as fibroids or endometrial polyps. In women with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and menorrhagia, a normal pelvic ultrasound strongly suggests that the bleeding is due to the bleeding diathesis.</p><p>The evaluation of women with abnormal uterine bleeding is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no large randomized trials providing data on which to base recommendations for managing these patients. Our approach is based upon small observational studies, case reports, and personal experience. In general, we suggest supporting women with moderate to severe menorrhagia with blood products, administering hormonal therapy, and inducing amenorrhea in those at risk of future chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of menorrhagia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">GnRH agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is a one-month interval before the expected time of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, we suggest administering a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate, so that amenorrhea can be induced prior to the start of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Breakthrough bleeding often occurs in the first two weeks of therapy and may require that the patient be supported with blood products.</p><p>One small study of women undergoing bone marrow transplantation achieved a high rate of amenorrhea by administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate 7.5 mg intramuscularly every 28 days, with the first injection given four to five weeks prior to bone marrow transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this series, women using oral contraceptives at the time of their initial leuprolide injection stopped their tablets either on the day of this injection or 21 days later. To avoid intramuscular injection in one patient with a platelet count of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/mcL</span> at the time of scheduled repeat leuprolide injection, a daily intravenous infusion of 1 mg of the subcutaneous formulation of leuprolide was successfully administered for two weeks, at which time the platelet count was higher.</p><p>A retrospective study described the outcome of oncology patients with regular menstrual cycles who received either depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA; n = 42), or a GnRH agonist (n = 39), or no treatment (n = 20) before the administration of myelosuppressive chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Only patients who later developed severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;25,000 platelets per microL) were included in the study. Severe or moderate menorrhagia occurred in none of the 39 women who received a GnRH agonist, in nine women (21 percent) who received DMPA, and in nine untreated patients (40 percent). Treatment with a GnRH agonist was significantly more effective than no treatment, and appeared to be more effective than DMPA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy of menorrhagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We support women with signs or symptoms of volume depletion during the menstrual period with blood products, and start them on either estrogen, an estrogen-progestin preparation, or high-dose progestin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A GnRH agonist can be initiated subsequently to prevent recurrent menorrhagia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'GnRH agonists'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have been bleeding heavily for a prolonged period of time (&ge;two weeks) have an atrophic, denuded endometrial lining. These patients need to have their endometrium stabilized with oral, transdermal, or intravenous estrogen or high-dose estrogen-progestin pills. Estrogen promotes rapid regrowth of endometrium over the denuded epithelial surface, stabilizes lysosomal membranes, and stimulates proliferation of endometrial ground substance. However, a problem with this approach is that nausea and vomiting are common with high-dose estrogen therapy and are also side effects of chemotherapy. Options for estrogen therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjugated estrogen (eg, Premarin) 1.25 mg orally two or three times per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estradiol 2 mg orally two or three times per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjugated estrogen 25 mg intravenously every six hours for 24 hours</p><p/><p>An antiemetic is often required (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a> 12.5 to 25 mg per rectum, as needed).</p><p>Pulmonary embolism is a potential complication of high-dose estrogen therapy. As a result, the dose and duration of estrogen administered should be the minimum needed to control bleeding. In particular, intravenous therapy should not be continued for more than 24 hours. Other contraindications to high-dose estrogen therapy are listed below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin'</a> below.)</p><p>Typically, the transition from high-dose estrogen to standard estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills can begin within a few days, and certainly by the time that hematologic indices have begun to return to normal. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent menorrhagia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen-progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High doses of an oral contraceptive pill (OC; eg, an OC containing 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol taken two to four times per day; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F104648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104648 \">table 2</a>)) supplemented with an antiemetic medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a> 12.5 to 25 mg per rectum, as needed) will often cause acute moderate to severe bleeding to subside within 48 hours. This regimen may not be as effective as estrogen alone because progestins inhibit the synthesis of estrogen receptors and increase estradiol dehydrogenase, thereby impeding the rapid proliferation of endometrium induced by estrogen.</p><p>High doses of estrogen-progestin regimens or estrogen alone (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen'</a> above) should be avoided in smokers because of the risk of venous thrombosis. Other medical contraindications to use of these hormone preparations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous thromboembolic event or stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known inherited thrombophilia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of an estrogen-dependent tumor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known hyperlipidemias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly controlled hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine headaches with aura</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus with vascular disease</p><p/><p>A transdermal estrogen-progestin patch (eg, Xulane) may be used instead of OC pills; the patch has the advantage of avoiding oral administration in women with nausea and vomiting or severe diarrhea. Two patches can be placed; however, this results in high estrogen levels (similar to two 100 mcg estrogen oral contraceptive pills), which are probably associated with an increased risk of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After the bleeding stops, the patient can be transitioned to once-a-day therapy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent menorrhagia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If estrogens are contraindicated, but progestins are not, then high-dose progestins may be administered. Progestin-only regimens are less successful than estrogen-progestin regimens and associated with more irregular bleeding. Progestin-only options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (20 to 40 mg per day in divided doses), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (40 to 120 mg per day in divided doses), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate (5 to 10 mg per day) for 5 to 10 days. Progestins, like estrogen, can be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]. We use progestins in smokers unless they have a history of thromboembolic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometrial ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases, endometrial ablation can be performed if all other methods of controlling bleeding have failed; however, this should be considered primarily in women who have completed childbearing since fertility cannot be guaranteed after the procedure. Furthermore, pregnancy can be hazardous (increased risk of miscarriage, antepartum hemorrhage, preterm delivery, abnormal placental attachment). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest administration of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to and after endometrial ablation, since these women are considered immunocompromised and at increased risk of infection. For example, one might use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> in the non-leukopenic patient and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> in leukopenic patients. We also suggest curettage prior to the procedure. This provides endometrial tissue for histopathologic evaluation to exclude malignancy and improves the success of the ablative procedure since a thin endometrium is more completely destroyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>More invasive procedures, such as uterine artery embolization, are contraindicated in the presence of thrombocytopenia. However, there are case reports of uterine artery embolization being used to treat life-threatening uterine hemorrhage in acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of recurrent menorrhagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial therapy, the patient needs to be placed on an ongoing hormonal regimen to induce endometrial atrophy and thereby prevent recurrent menorrhagia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen-progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may be started or continued on estrogen-progestin preparations with 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol or equivalent after initial therapy of menorrhagia. These agents provide the dual benefits of reducing or suppressing menses and providing contraception. The maximum benefit can be achieved with continuous, rather than cyclic, administration. Either pills or a transdermal patch can be used; the latter has the advantage of being retained in the presence of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic options'</a>.)</p><p>There will be some breakthrough bleeding in the first 6 to 12 months of hormonal therapy. In patients with thrombocytopenia, this is undesirable since a low platelet count can lead to uncontrolled bleeding. Therefore, these agents are most useful when continued in women already taking them at the time of their cancer diagnosis and those who will receive chemotherapy over several months and can be supported with blood products as needed for breakthrough bleeds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A progestin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> 20 to 40 mg daily in divided doses) can be given to suppress menses. Patients can often be supported with this regimen for a considerable period of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1839037882\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
