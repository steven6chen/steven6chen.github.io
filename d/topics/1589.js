SCA is a major public health challenge, accounting for approximately 5 to 15 percent of total mortality in industrialized nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although survival from SCA remains generally poor, there is evidence from contemporary population-based registries that outcomes following out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest have improved compared with historical experiences. However, there is substantial disparity across systems and hence opportunity to improve outcomes. Based on contemporary estimates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, approximately 10 percent of emergency medical services-treated patients in any cardiac rhythm and 30 percent of patients whose initial rhythm is VF survive to be discharged from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. Based on registry data from the United States and Great Britain, contemporary survival rates for in-hospital arrest are estimated at 20 percent for all rhythms and nearly 50 percent for patients with an initial rhythm of VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although several interventions can improve the likelihood of VF resuscitation, the single most important is early delivery of an external electric shock to reset the cardiac rhythm and restore spontaneous circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Early defibrillation is consistently associated with a greater likelihood of survival, which decreases by approximately 5 to 10 percent with each additional minute from collapse to defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The potential benefit of early defibrillation is best illustrated by the outcomes following defibrillation at casinos; 74 percent with witnessed VF survived when a shock was delivered within three minutes from collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A 2017 review of observational studies reported early defibrillation with automated external defibrillators (AEDs) is associated with an approximate doubling of survival when an AED was applied by lay first responders (survival of 53 percent) compared with professional personnel dispatched by emergency medical dispatch centers (survival of 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the development, use, allocation, and efficacy of AEDs.

Nevertheless, they can be challenging to use, especially for the layperson [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>The best approach for training laypersons to achieve and maintain AED operational proficiency is not well established, although face-to-face, video, and web-based training approaches have demonstrated merit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A study of older laypersons previously trained in AED use showed that emergency dispatchers were successfully able to assist rescuers to use AEDs via telephone instructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Online and in-person classes are available (<a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/aed&amp;token=gHgfAPQIBJZBPDYSeLaRCkboQctDaNRMKTHZluwaga7CMuzJaLGuPFYm12RUWOkknfPKXxLaGBvaAH3LaA8zgw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5657\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/aed</a>) to assist persons with AEDs or those who are considering purchase of an AED. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">AED operation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AEDs utilize two self-adhesive electrode pads placed directly on the bare chest to detect the cardiac rhythm and to deliver shocks when indicated. International standards require that AEDs have a sensitivity of &gt;90 percent for detecting ventricular fibrillation (VF; at least 0.2 mV in amplitude) and an overall specificity of &gt;95 percent, a level of discrimination that compares favorably with manual field interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In a 2015 study comparing four commercially available AEDs, all of the devices correctly identified VF greater than 95 percent of the time; however, there was a wide range of diagnostic accuracy for correctly identifying ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Most AEDs deliver between 120 and 360 Joules, with the output depending upon several factors including the number of shocks previously administered, the impedance of the chest wall, and whether a monophasic or biphasic waveform is used. Some AEDs are automatically adjusted to deliver less electricity (intended for children) when pediatric pads are attached. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Monophasic versus biphasic waveforms'</a>.)</p><p>AEDs typically provide audio prompts that direct rescuers to stand clear of the victim during rhythm analysis and to press a button to deliver the shock. AEDs are programmed to subsequently reanalyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm typically every two minutes. During the intervening time period, the AED prompts the rescuer to check for signs of life and, if needed, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If the patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that is delivering shocks, the ICD should be allowed to complete its treatment cycle (typically 30 to 60 seconds) before the AED is attached.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pad placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines make the following recommendations regarding placement of AED pads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AED pads should be placed in the sternal-apical (anterolateral) position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103268 \">figure 1</a>), with the right pad placed on the right superior-anterior chest below the clavicle, and the left pad placed on the inferior-lateral left chest, lateral to the left breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceptable alternatives are biaxillary positioning, with pads placed on the right and left lateral chest walls, or placement of the left pad in the standard apical position, with the other pad on the right or left upper back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pads should be placed at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) away from any implantable devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AED pads should NOT be placed directly on top of a transdermal medication patch since it can interfere with therapy and also cause skin burns.

This can be done by rapidly removing an adhesive AED pad or by shaving the chest in the area where the pad will be placed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional features present in most AED models include the ability to continuously record the arrest rhythm ECG, derive measures of CPR performance such as chest compressions or ventilations, and record the voices of rescuers involved in the event. The combination of these features enables case review that may be used for quality assurance or research. Such data indicate that CPR often does not meet guideline standards and is frequently interrupted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>Newer AED models incorporate more dynamic prompts or real-time feedback to guide rescuer CPR actions. Although these real-time prompts can improve CPR performance, it is not yet known if these features will improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">AED ALLOCATION STRATEGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AEDs are effective only in those patients who present with ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT); pulseless electrical activity and asystole are not effectively treated by defibrillation. Although the proportion of <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/VT</span> arrests is declining relative to nonshockable rhythms, <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/VT</span> arrests still account for tens of thousands of deaths each year in the United States, and the improved resuscitation provided by AEDs can have a significant impact on public health.</p><p>AEDs enable people who are not trained in rhythm interpretation to provide life-saving therapy, which vastly increases the pool of potential rescuers who can provide early defibrillation. However, their allocation and use require programmatic support, training, and maintenance, all of which can contribute to overall cost. Thus, an important consideration regarding these devices is efficient distribution of AEDs throughout communities.</p><p>Strategies for AED allocation include providing them to traditional emergency medical services (EMS) and to nonmedical emergency responders (eg, police officers and firefighters), as well as placing them in public locations, in hospitals, and in the homes of individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency medical services AED programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial large-scale implementation of AEDs was by emergency medical services (EMS) in the 1980s and 1990s. This strategy provided the potential for earlier defibrillation by allocating AEDs to EMS first responders (emergency medical technicians), many of whom were not typically trained in rhythm interpretation.</p><p>Some EMS AED programs were associated with improvements in survival, but others were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Meta-analyses found that EMS AED programs resulted in a significant 9 percent increase in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. However, weaknesses in individual study design limit the strength of these conclusions.</p><p>In some reports, survival from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to VF did not improve despite reductions in the time to defibrillation observed with the adoption of the AED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the resuscitation algorithms that were originally used for AED rhythm analysis and processing required considerable interruptions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) compared with treatment with a manual defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>] and that the increase in &quot;hands-off&quot; time reduced the chances of successful resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Excellent basic life support and its importance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Police AED programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Police officers can sometimes respond to SCA victims more quickly than EMS providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A program of providing AEDs to police officers and training them in their use was initially introduced in the late 1980s in Rochester, Minnesota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Police often arrived at SCAs due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) prior to EMS and defibrillated patients an average of 5.5 minutes following collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Ten of 14 patients survived to hospital discharge. In a later series of 193 patients, survival from witnessed VF to hospital discharge was 46 percent. Most were neurologically intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In contrast, survival from SCA not caused by VF was only 5 percent.</p><p>Implementation of police AED programs in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Miami-Dade County, Florida, King County, Washington, and Zurich, Switzerland, has also been associated with greater survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. However, other police AED programs have not shown survival benefits compared with standard EMS, particularly when the police often have not arrived before EMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Thus, one of the keys to a successful police AED program is committed medical and police leaders who can motivate police about their potential lifesaving role and in turn respond quickly. A meta-analysis of police AED programs, published in 2013, described the potential benefits and challenges of implementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Public access defibrillation programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance studies have identified particular locations where SCA occurs with high frequency, including public transit facilities, shopping malls, public sports venues, industrial sites, golf courses, casinos, dialysis centers, and fitness centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-56</a>]. AEDs strategically located in such places can be used by laypersons to deliver defibrillation prior to EMS arrival, a concept referred to as &quot;public access defibrillation&quot; (PAD). The benefits of PAD on survival rates and neurologic outcomes after SCA are illustrated by the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/11,57-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,57-61</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) trial, a prospective multi-community randomized trial, evaluated survival to discharge in 526 patients with SCA. Following SCA, survival to discharge rates significantly increased in high-risk public sites where CPR-trained lay responders were equipped with AEDs compared with sites where lay responders were CPR-trained, but did not have access to AEDs (23.4 versus 14.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Furthermore, PAD programs implemented at high-risk sites offer reasonable health benefit for the cost, ranging from $35,000 to $57,000 per quality adjusted life-year, which is comparable to other widely-accepted medical interventions such as bone marrow transplant ($52,000 per quality adjusted life-year) and heart transplant ($59,000 per quality adjusted life-year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large, multi-community cohort study evaluated the outcome of over 13,000 patients with an out-of-hospital SCA. Survival to hospital discharge was markedly greater in patients who received an AED-delivered shock from a non-traditional responder (most often layperson) compared with patients receiving bystander CPR alone or those presenting with VF whose initial shock was delivered by EMS (38 versus 9 versus 22 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival with intact neurologic function is higher in patients with SCA who receive treatment with an AED available at the site of the arrest.

As public access defibrillation increased, mean time to shock was reduced (from 3.7 to 2.2 minutes), with a significant improvement in one month survival with favorable neurologic function (38.5 percent compared with 18.2 percent for those who did not receive public access defibrillation; adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvements in time to defibrillation and survival with favorable neurologic function have also been reported from a 2006 to 2012 nationwide study of AED use in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p>The survival benefit observed in these programs has led to advocacy for lower-risk sites to implement PAD programs. As an example, guidelines have been established for school-based AED programs which have increased substantially over time, partly because of legislation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. PAD programs are also mandated in many federal locations. Use at lower-risk sites provides the opportunity to increase the number of SCA survivors but with a lower cost-effectiveness. At present, PAD program AEDs are involved in only a small fraction of all out-of-hospital SCAs so that strategies that increase their use are a promising strategy to improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/59,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165518244\"><span class=\"h3\">Smart phone apps for notification of cardiac arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smart phone apps now exist to allow a person close to a suspected cardiac arrest to be notified by the 911 emergency dispatch center. These apps (see PulsePoint.org for one example) are downloaded on volunteers' phones, and when a suspected cardiac arrest occurs nearby, volunteers (typically within a quarter mile of the event) are alerted on their smart phone with the location pinpointed on a map. There are anecdotal reports of volunteers starting CPR prior to arrival of EMS personnel from the local media. The strategy can increase early CPR and survival in select communities in public setting and potentially residential setting arrests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. If public AEDs are nearby, these may also be identified via a dynamic software platform integrated with the smart phone app. The strategy to also link the location of nearby AEDs to those alerted to respond and provide CPR is a promising adjunct, though the approach requires that the AED location be registered and verified via the smart phone app.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">AEDs for use in private homes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since approximately three-quarters of SCAs occur in private homes, one strategy to reduce mortality is to distribute AEDs for use in the home.</p><p>Home use of AEDs was investigated in a randomized trial of 7001 patients with previous anterior wall myocardial infarct ion who were not candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

The explanation for lower survival may be the disproportionate excess of asystole in the AED group, some other unmeasured confounder, or the potential that AED application and use may truly delay or interrupt other beneficial therapies.</p><p>The optimal strategy of AED distribution and its ultimate benefit may depend upon a particular hospital's staffing, geography, and patient profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143499729\"><span class=\"h2\">AEDs in medical and dental practices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac arrest in a medical or dental setting is an infrequent event. Data from King County, Washington, rank the likelihood of a cardiac arrest occurring, with dialysis centers having the highest risk (approximately one per year). The next highest risk locations are cardiology practices, urgent care centers, internal medicine, and family medicine. The lowest risk locations are dental settings. Despite the low risk in most practices, we believe virtually all medical practices should have an AED, and dialysis centers should definitely have an AED on site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although AEDs have saved many lives, they have several potential drawbacks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AEDs require the presence of a bystander to apply and operate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only about 50 percent of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) events are witnessed. Thus, effective defibrillation is often not relevant by the time the victim of an unwitnessed SCA is found.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AEDs require interruptions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while they assess the cardiac rhythm. This analysis time is typically longer with AEDs than with manual defibrillators. Ongoing efforts are aimed at minimizing this time, and technical advances may eventually enable accurate rhythm interpretation even while CPR is ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Excellent basic life support and its importance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cost of AEDs can be an important obstacle to potential health benefits. AEDs intended for personal or public use (such as in an airport or doctor's office) are readily available for approximately $1000. Commercial-grade AEDs (such as for use by EMTs) typically cost $2500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p>Prognostic information on SCA patients is available from the shape and pattern of the ventricular fibrillation (VF) waveform recorded in the ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. AEDs can analyze this information in real-time to potentially guide rescuers to the best course of treatment with CPR, defibrillation, and medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Although this research is intriguing, the survival effects of dynamic processing of the VF waveform are largely untested.</p><p>Wearable AEDs have been developed. Their evidence-based role has not been established, and their use is best determined through clinical assessment of risk and benefit for the individual patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some advocates of widespread AED dissemination have considered AEDs as compulsory safety equipment along the lines of smoke alarms and fire extinguishers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Such an approach has not been tested and is cost prohibitive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major public health challenge for which early defibrillation can improve survival among those with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, definitive treatment of out-of-hospital SCA with early defibrillation was limited by the small number of qualified rescuers who could interpret cardiac rhythms. Since AEDs analyze cardiac rhythms and directly inform rescuers whether a shock is indicated, their advent has enabled lay rescuers and additional public safety personnel to provide early defibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'AED operation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful early defibrillation using an AED, when appropriate, has been shown to significantly improve survival and survival with intact neurologic function following out-of-hospital SCA. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Public access defibrillation programs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innovative programs using smart phone apps have the potential to deploy AEDs and deliver defibrillation earlier, and thus improve the chances of survival. (See <a href=\"#H1165518244\" class=\"local\">'Smart phone apps for notification of cardiac arrest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the hospital setting, AED use was not associated with a survival difference compared with manual external defibrillation among VF arrest and associated with a lower survival among nonshockable arrest. The optimal in-hospital strategy of AED distribution and its ultimate benefit may depend upon a particular hospital's staffing, geography, and patient profile. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'In-hospital AED allocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While AEDs can be highly effective, appropriate use does require interruptions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation to assess the cardiac rhythm. The increase in &quot;hands-off&quot; time may reduce the chances of successful resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Challenges and opportunities'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Excellent basic life support and its importance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143499526\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Laura Gold, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-external-defibrillators/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Zheng ZJ, Croft JB, Giles WH, Mensah GA.
