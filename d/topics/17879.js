Orthostatic hypotension can cause dizziness, syncope, and even angina or stroke. </p><p>Symptomatic falls in blood pressure after standing or eating are a frequent clinical problem. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension varies from 5 to 20 percent in different reports. Many disorders can cause orthostatic hypotension, which can also be a symptom of acute or chronic volume depletion. A related problem, postprandial hypotension (a fall in blood pressure occurring 15 to 90 minutes after meals) is also common in older patients. Orthostatic hypotension can be a disabling condition and is also a risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, as well as falls with attendant morbidity.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of chronic orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. The patient with acute orthostatic hypotension due to volume depletion should be treated with volume replacement. </p><p>The causes and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension are discussed separately. POTS is also discussed separately.

Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension is common and of uncertain clinical relevance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following sections on therapy are directed toward the patient with chronic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction. The patient with acute orthostatic hypotension due to volume depletion should be treated with volume replacement.</p><p>Nonpharmacologic measures are important components of the therapy of chronic orthostatic hypotension. These include removal of offending agents, patient education, physical and dietary interventions, and avoiding precipitating factors. While limited numbers of randomized studies to evaluate efficacy exist, clinical experience suggests benefit while avoiding medication side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Removal of offending medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recognition and removal of drugs that cause orthostatic hypotension is the first management step. The most common offending agents are diuretics, antihypertensive (primarily sympathetic blockers), antianginal drugs (nitrates), alpha-adrenergic antagonists, and antidepressants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89955\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89955 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education is very important for the management of chronic orthostatic hypotension. Throughout the day, patients are subject to a number of orthostatic demands for which there are simple and effective countermeasures. As a result, the time spent emphasizing practical management principles is of inestimable value. These measures include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arising slowly, in stages, from supine to seated to standing. This maneuver is most important in the morning, when orthostatic tolerance is lowest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding straining, coughing, and walking in hot weather; these activities reduce venous return and worsen orthostatic hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining hydration and avoiding over-heating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising the head of the bed 10 to 20 degrees decreases renal perfusion, thereby activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreasing nocturnal diuresis, which can be pronounced in these patients. These changes relieve orthostatic hypotension by expanding extracellular fluid volume and may reduce end organ damage by reducing supine hypertension.<br/><br/>Only small case series and clinical experience support the efficacy of this intervention, but its effect in patients with autonomic failure can be dramatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one series of nine older inpatients with orthostatic hypotension, six inches of head of bed elevation during sleep was associated with higher blood pressure and improved mobility after one week of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A follow-up study by the same investigators found that this same intervention in 100 community-dwelling patients had no effect on symptoms or hemodynamic parameters after six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of custom-fitted elastic stockings permits the application of graded pressure to the lower extremities and lower abdomen, thereby minimizing peripheral blood pooling. It is essential that such stockings extend to the waist since most peripheral pooling occurs in the splanchnic circulation. These stockings are poorly tolerated by many patients, particularly those with painful peripheral neuropathies or motor dysfunction and those living in hot climates. They are difficult to take on and off. Compression stockings may be contraindicated in patients with evidence of leg ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease, or extensive skin lesions on their lower extremities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>One report of ten patients found that compression stockings in patients with orthostatic hypotension and a history of falls reduced the average degree of orthostasis in the group as a whole, and abolished orthostatic dizziness in seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

As an example, a small study of five elderly patients in whom tilt-table testing at baseline resulted in symptoms showed that an exercise regimen consisting of walking or climbing stairs for 30 to 45 minutes per day three times per week for six months resulted in symptom disappearance during a repeat tilt-table test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifying meals can be helpful, especially when symptoms appear to occur in association with eating.

Another study also found that tensing lower body muscles in the legs, buttocks, and abdomen before arising from a squat position blunted the hypotensive response and clinical symptoms in a series of 13 patients with orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isometric handgrip when standing was effective in reducing symptoms and minimizing decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output in a case series of 14 patients (age 15 to 22 years) with orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory maneuvers are under investigation as a means of treating orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Increased negative inspiratory intrathoracic pressure may reduce orthostatic hypotension by augmenting venous return. Techniques such as inspiration through pursed lips, inspiratory sniffing, and use of an external device causing selective inspiratory obstruction were shown in 10 patients to improve standing blood pressure comparable to leg muscle tensing as long as hyperventilation was avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal binders have been shown to ameliorate orthostatic blood pressure change in some patients with orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]; there is less evidence regarding their efficacy on symptom amelioration. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased salt and water intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reduction in central blood volume associated with autonomic insufficiency (due to increased urinary sodium and water excretion) can be attenuated by increasing sodium and water intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p>In a study of 11 patients with severe orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure, blood pressure increased significantly after drinking 480 mL of tap water in less than five minutes from <span class=\"nowrap\">83&plusmn;6/53&plusmn;3</span>.4 mmHg at baseline, to <span class=\"nowrap\">114&plusmn;30/66&plusmn;18</span> mmHg 35 minutes later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].
