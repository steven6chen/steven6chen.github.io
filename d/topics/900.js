It is important to know whether any increase in IOP is likely to be critical for future vision.</p><p>Regional or topical anesthesia may be an option to avoid general anesthesia in some patients who have a high risk of difficulty with intubation and ventilation, particularly if the likelihood of salvaging vision is low, making concerns regarding increased IOP less critical (see <a href=\"#H39653038\" class=\"local\">'Regional anesthesia'</a> below). </p><p>If a regional technique is not feasible or optimal for ophthalmologic surgery, an awake fiberoptic laryngoscopy may be the safest option. During this procedure, the risk of gagging or coughing with consequent increases in IOP is minimized by thorough topical anesthesia of the airway, nerve blocks that anesthetize the nasopharynx, oropharynx, glottis, and trachea, and adequate sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> infusion, or bolus doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>).

If the pediatric patient is combative and agitated, sedation with oral agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> administered 20 to 30 minutes before the procedure may allow insertion of an IV catheter for anesthetic induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-emergent-eye-surgery/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Also, regional techniques may be technically difficult because the anatomy of the eye and surrounding tissue may be partially or completely distorted by trauma, bleeding, and edema. In many cases, a traumatically injured patient is unable to cooperate for a regional block.</p><p>However, regional anesthesia is considered when the likelihood of salvaging vision is low, particularly in a patient with a potentially difficult airway, since concerns regarding increased IOP are less critical. A regional block is more likely to succeed if the wound is anterior and relatively small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-emergent-eye-surgery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Case reports have described successful use of regional ophthalmic blocks after selected types of traumatic eye injury (eg, intraocular foreign body removal, repair of dehiscence of a previous surgical wound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-emergent-eye-surgery/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].
