Consequently, development of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) (eg, atrial fibrillation [AF] or flutter) or atrioventricular dissociation such as a junctional rhythm typically results in hypotension due to markedly reduced LV filling with reduced SV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If new onset AF or other SVT occurs, the dysrhythmia is treated immediately to attempt to restore SR, as well as control of the ventricular rate.

In a hemodynamically unstable patient with severe hypotension or evidence of cardiogenic shock, synchronized cardioversion may be necessary to restore SR.

Any tachyarrhythmia (eg, sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation [AF] with rapid ventricular response) can result in sudden severe hypotension and pulmonary edema due to inadequate time during diastole for blood in the LA to empty into the LV through the stenotic mitral valve. The sudden decrease in LV filling, stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) causes hypotension, while the sudden increase in LA pressure causes pulmonary edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although a relatively slow HR is optimal, severe bradycardia is avoided because the limited flow across the stenotic mitral valve limits LV filling and SV.
