Nausea, the unpleasant sensation of being about to vomit, can occur alone or can accompany vomiting, dyspepsia, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Vomiting is the expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth caused by forceful and sustained contraction of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm. Retching differs from vomiting in the absence of expulsion of gastric contents. &#160;</p><p>There are many potential causes of nausea and vomiting in palliative care populations, and the etiology is often multifactorial, particularly in patients with cancer. In such patients, nausea and vomiting might be caused by anti-tumor treatment (radiation therapy or chemotherapy), represent an acute complication of the malignancy (hypercalcemia, malignant bowel obstruction), be due to gastroparesis (eg, from autonomic dysfunction), or be from drug-induced constipation (opioids, type 3 serotonin receptor [5HT3] antagonists). These various causes of nausea and vomiting may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any individual patient. </p><p>This topic review will cover the prevalence, <span class=\"nowrap\">etiology/pathophysiology,</span> assessment, and management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care populations. Chemotherapy- and radiation therapy-induced nausea and vomiting are covered in detail elsewhere.

Cancer treatment is one of the more common causes of nausea and vomiting in such patients. Despite adherence to published guidelines on prophylactic antiemetics, breakthrough nausea and vomiting affects up to 40 percent of patients treated with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429887343\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and severity of RT-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) are both treatment-related (irradiated site and volume, single and total dose, fractionation schedule, techniques) and patient-related (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81948 \">table 1</a>). The most important factor appears to be the radiation field. Between 90 and 100 percent of patients receiving total body or total nodal irradiation, 60 to 90 percent of those undergoing abdominopelvic, upper abdominal, or mantle irradiation, and 30 to 60 percent of those receiving craniospinal, pelvic, thoracic, or head and neck irradiation will develop RINV. Irradiation to the breast or extremities produces only a 0 to 10 percent risk. Risk categories for emesis that are based upon the site of irradiation have been combined with patient-related factors to stratify a patient&rsquo;s risk for RINV into four categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70623 \">figure 1</a>).

Chemotherapy agents are divided into four emetogenic levels, which are defined by the expected frequency of emesis in the absence of effective antiemetic prophylaxis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and prediction of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy agent'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High &ndash; &gt;90 percent risk of emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; &gt;30 to 90 percent risk of emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low &ndash; 10 to 30 percent risk of emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal &ndash; &lt;10 percent risk of emesis</p><p/><p>The predicted acute emetogenicity potential of individual parenteral and oral chemotherapy agents is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58756 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65923 \">table 3</a>). For combination regimens, the emetogenic level is determined by identifying the most emetogenic agent in the combination and then assessing the relative contribution of the other agents. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> are both moderately emetogenic agents, but when given together, the regimen is considered to be highly emetogenic.

The incidence of breakthrough symptoms is as high as 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Conventional antiemetics are more successful at preventing emesis than in preventing nausea, particularly delayed nausea.

In several reports, the prevalence of nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting in terminal cancer patients who are no longer receiving anti-tumor treatment ranges from 30 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. Although nausea is frequently reported, longitudinal studies measuring symptom intensity with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) suggest that it is generally not severe at the end of life; fewer than 20 percent of affected patients have a score &ge;4 (moderate intensity or worse) during the last seven days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A population based cohort of over 10,000 patients also found nausea intensity to be low (mean ESAS &lt;1.5) with a stable, flat trajectory over the last six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Effective, readily available pharmacologic antiemetics may in part explain the low ESAS scores for nausea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429886740\"><span class=\"h2\">Other palliative care patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are fewer studies describing the prevalence of nausea and vomiting in patients with an advanced serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life threatening illness other than cancer. The following data are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] comparing the prevalence of symptoms among end-stage patients with cancer, AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD) found that rates of nausea ranged from 43 to 49 percent in patients with AIDS, 17 to 48 percent in HF, and 30 to 43 percent in patients with CKD. No data could be obtained for the prevalence of nausea among patients with COPD. However, a subsequent study of patients with advanced COPD found a prevalence of 18 percent for nausea and 4 percent for emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second systematic review of 39 articles found similar results as regards to the heterogeneity and prevalence of symptoms in patients with various end stage diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with CKD and HF were again found to have the highest prevalence of nausea (about 40 and 25 percent, respectively), although coexisting morbidities were considerable in some of the studies and the definition, intensity, and etiology of the nausea were unclear. </p><p/><p>Some of the challenge inherent to studying nausea and emesis in palliative care populations with life-limiting illness is that there may not be a clear distinction between nausea and vomiting. The distinction is important, since nausea and vomiting may have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and also different responses to interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1858965\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of palliative care, identifying the underlying cause(s) of nausea and vomiting may be useful for selecting the therapeutic option. However, the success of etiology-based therapy is limited by the multifactorial etiology of nausea and vomiting, particularly in cancer patients, and the lack of prospective data demonstrating the superiority of this approach over empirically chosen antiemetic therapy (with the exception of chemotherapy- or radiation-related nausea and vomiting and treatment for malignant bowel obstruction). Nevertheless, etiology-based management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients is widely practiced. (See <a href=\"#H507776747\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic approaches'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1858974\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiologic pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important distinction must be made between the mechanisms producing emesis (vomiting, retching) and those causing nausea. Emesis is not merely a more severe degree of nausea, since the neural circuits responsible for nausea appear to be anatomically distinct from those that generate emesis. </p><p>Emesis is mediated centrally by two separate &ldquo;centers&rdquo;, the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and the vomiting center (VC), an anatomically indistinct area that includes the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87723\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87723 \">figure 2</a>). Neural input from the CTZ, vestibular system, higher cortical centers, and thoracoabdominal organs is integrated in the VC. Chemosensitive receptors of the CTZ detect emetic agents in the blood and relay this information to the adjacent VC. The CTZ lacks a blood-brain barrier, and this allows toxins to activate the CTZ via dopamine 2 receptors. Peripheral signals from abdominal vagal afferents and splanchnic nerves that detect intestinal luminal contents and gastric tone via mechanoreceptors or by the release of serotonin from gut enterochromaffin cells also terminate in the NTS and can lead to emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The vomiting reflex is coordinated by the VC in the brainstem and does not require input from the cortex. As such, autonomic activation, sepsis, and motion may induce vomiting in decorticate individuals.</p><p>On the other hand, the mechanisms underlying the symptom of nausea are not well understood. However, unlike vomiting, nausea requires conscious awareness and cerebral function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Studies of motion sickness in humans suggest involvement of gastric myoelectrical activity and endogenous neuroendocrine responses (ie, increases in plasma cortisol, beta-endorphins, epinephrine and norepinephrine). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with nausea and vomiting&quot;, section on 'Nausea'</a>.) </p><p>Furthermore, the concept that nausea is mediated through different pathways than emesis is supported by the observation that nausea and vomiting seem to be pharmacologically distinct. Among patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy, neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists and type 3 serotonin (5HT3) receptor antagonists appear to control emesis more effectively than they control nausea, particularly delayed nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Although the differential diagnosis is broad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78422 \">table 4</a>), the most common causes of nausea and vomiting in this population are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87625\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87625 \">table 5</a>).

Most patients have two or more contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Additional laboratory investigations or imaging may be required depending on the clinical presentation and prognosis of the patient. However, even in advanced disease, when the burden of diagnostic testing may outweigh the benefit, additional investigations (eg, abdominal CT) may be justified if they have the potential for identifying potentially modifiable etiologies that might influence management. </p><p>For patients near death, empiric treatment for nausea (eg, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>) is reasonable without a search for a specific etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Despite adherence to published guidelines, breakthrough nausea and vomiting affects up to 40 percent of patients treated with either modality. (See <a href=\"#H429886680\" class=\"local\">'Cancer patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic nausea is also a significant problem in patients with terminal cancer who are not receiving active cancer treatment and in other palliative care populations with chronic kidney disease, AIDS, and heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H429887311\" class=\"local\">'Unrelated to cancer therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H429886740\" class=\"local\">'Other palliative care patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many cases, the cause can be determined from the history and physical examination. The most common causes of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87625\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87625 \">table 5</a>); most patients have two or more contributing factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional laboratory investigations or imaging may be required depending on the clinical presentation and prognosis of the patient. However, even in advanced disease, when the burden of diagnostic testing may outweigh the benefit, investigations may be justified if they could identify potentially modifiable etiologies and influence management. (See <a href=\"#H1858965\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An effort should be made to identify and correct reversible underlying causes. This may include correction of metabolic abnormalities, aggressive bowel care for constipated patients, opioid rotation in patients with suspected opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, and in patients with cancer who have brain metastases, the administration of glucocorticoids followed by local therapy (radiation or surgery). (See <a href=\"#H2212493\" class=\"local\">'Potentially treatable cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most patients with advanced cancer and chronic nausea will have no obvious etiology other than underlying autonomic dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastroparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dopamine, histamine, serotonin (both type 3 [5HT3], and type 4 [5HT4]), and muscarinic (acetylcholine) receptor antagonists are all established classes of antiemetic and antinausea agents that have been used in the palliative care setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F91324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91324 \">table 6</a>).
