The measurement is usually made using diazo reagents and spectrophotometry. Conjugated bilirubin reacts rapidly (&quot;directly&quot;) with the reagents. The measurement of unconjugated bilirubin requires the addition of an accelerator compound and is often referred to as the indirect bilirubin.

The physiologic jaundice of the neonate represents a classic example which combines all of these mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Overproduction of bilirubin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilirubin overproduction may result from excessive breakdown of heme derived from hemoglobin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65197 \">figure 2</a>). Extravascular or intravascular hemolysis, extravasation of blood in tissues, or dyserythropoiesis are causes of enhanced heme catabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gilbert syndrome and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to bilirubin overproduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Extravascular hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen, bone marrow, and liver are responsible for the increased extravascular destruction of erythrocytes which occurs in most hemolytic disorders. These phagocytic mononuclear cells are rich in heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase activities and rapidly degrade heme to bilirubin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65197 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bilirubin-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bilirubin metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Extravasation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When blood is extravasated into tissues, erythrocytes are phagocytosed by tissue macrophages that degrade heme to biliverdin and subsequently bilirubin, resulting in the sequential green and yellow discoloration of the skin overlying a hematoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravascular hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With intravascular hemolysis, bilirubin is predominantly formed in the liver and the kidneys. Hemoglobin released in the circulation is bound to haptoglobin; this complex is internalized and degraded by hepatocytes. However, circulating haptoglobin may be depleted with massive hemolysis. In these cases, unbound hemoglobin is converted to methemoglobin, from which heme is transferred to hemopexin or to albumin forming methemalbumin. Heme-hemopexin and methemalbumin are internalized by hepatocytes, where heme is degraded to bilirubin.</p><p>A significant fraction of free methemoglobin is filtered by renal glomeruli after dissociation of the tetrameric globin to two dimers. Only the free (unbound) dimer is small enough to be filtered across the glomeruli. The heme moiety of filtered methemoglobin is largely degraded by tubular epithelial cells to bilirubin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Dyserythropoiesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyserythropoiesis is a term used in a variety of diseases including megaloblastic and sideroblastic anemias, severe iron deficiency anemia, erythropoietic porphyria, erythroleukemia, lead poisoning, and a rare disorder of unknown pathogenesis termed primary shunt hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In these disorders, the incorporation of hemoglobin into erythrocytes is defective, leading to the degradation of a large fraction of unincorporated hemoglobin heme.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum bilirubin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a stress situation, hemolysis, and therefore unconjugated bilirubin production, can increase up to 10-fold. The canalicular excretion of bilirubin is the rate-limiting step in bilirubin elimination since hepatic conjugating capacity normally exceeds maximum bilirubin production. These relationships account for two findings at a steady state of maximum bilirubin production in patients with normal hepatic function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum bilirubin concentration will not exceed 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (68 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/liter)</span> in patients with normal liver function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; however, hemolysis can lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia in patients who have even mild hepatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion of conjugated bilirubin in plasma (approximately 3 to 5 percent of the total) remains normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>There are two reasons why the bilirubin concentration increases during hemolysis in the presence of normal bilirubin glucuronidation. First, bilirubin is produced mainly outside the liver; as a result, it must enter the blood stream during transit to the liver. Second, a small amount of bilirubin taken up by the hepatocyte is transferred to plasma by diffusion or via ATP-consuming mechanisms. Because conjugated bilirubin is very efficiently cleared, the proportion of conjugated bilirubin in the plasma (around 5 percent) does not increase until canalicular excretion capacity is exceeded. At that point, a disproportionate amount of conjugated bilirubin accumulates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilirubin overproduction with coexisting liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most liver diseases affect canalicular excretion, resulting in the accumulation of both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in hepatocytes. In cholestatic states, the canalicular ATP-dependent organic anion pump, MRP2, is down-regulated. This may lead to upregulation of other forms of MRP, such as MRP3, in the contiguous membranes of the hepatocyte, resulting in active transport of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin into the plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Thus, plasma bilirubin accumulating in conditions resulting from a combination of bilirubin overload and liver disease is always a mixture of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. In cases where there is an inherited deficiency of conjugation (eg, Gilbert syndrome), hemolysis causes almost pure unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The rate-limiting step in these patients is bilirubin glucuronidation, rather than canalicular excretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gilbert syndrome and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to bilirubin overproduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum bilirubin level is of particular significance when diagnosing Wilson disease in the setting of acute liver failure. In contrast to most liver diseases, serum alkaline phosphatase activity is low or normal in Wilson disease and, because of bilirubin overproduction due to hemolysis, the serum bilirubin level is high. A serum alkaline phosphatase (international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L)/bilirubin</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dl)</span> ratio of &lt;4 provides 94 percent sensitivity and 96 percent specificity for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in adult patients presenting with acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the sensitivity of this ratio may be reduced in children, probably because of a higher contribution of alkaline phosphatase from non-hepatic sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H69501971\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Acute hepatitis and acute liver failure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Urobilinogen excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As bilirubin excretion in bile increases in states of bilirubin overproduction, more urobilinogen appears in the stool and urine. However, the amount of urobilinogen in stool and urine is not proportional to bilirubin excretion since conversion of bilirubin to urobilinogen is not quantitative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Gallstones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronically increased biliary bilirubin excretion can lead to brown or black pigment stones consisting of precipitated monoconjugated and unconjugated bile pigments. Black pigment stones generally form in the gallbladder and may contain polymerized bile pigments. Brown stones form in the bile ducts, often in the presence of infection. They consist of calcium bilirubinate, mucin glycoproteins, and various other salts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired delivery of bilirubin to the liver and disorders of internalization of bilirubin by the hepatocyte result in reduced hepatic bilirubin uptake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52393 \">figure 3</a>). Congestive heart failure or portosystemic shunts (spontaneously occurring collaterals in cirrhosis or surgical shunts) reduce hepatic blood flow and the delivery of bilirubin to hepatocytes, resulting in predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. In some patients with cirrhosis, the direct contact of plasma with the hepatocytes may be compromised due to capillarization of the sinusoidal endothelial cells (loss of fenestrae), resulting in a further reduction in bilirubin uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Other causes of abnormal bilirubin uptake include Gilbert syndrome, in which uptake of bilirubin at the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes is impaired (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gilbert syndrome and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to bilirubin overproduction&quot;</a>), and the administration of several drugs (eg, rifamycin antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a>, flavaspidic acid, and bunamiodyl, a cholecystographic agent). The drug-induced defect usually resolves within 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired bilirubin conjugation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced bilirubin conjugation as a result of a decreased or absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity is found both in several acquired conditions and inherited diseases, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type I and II and Gilbert syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gilbert syndrome and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to bilirubin overproduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crigler-najjar-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crigler-Najjar syndrome&quot;</a>.) Bilirubin conjugating activity is also very low in the neonatal liver.</p><p>UGT activity toward bilirubin is modulated by various hormones. Hyperthyroidism and ethinyl estradiol, but not other oral contraceptives, inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In comparison, the combination of progestational and estrogenic steroids results in increased enzyme activity. Bilirubin glucuronidation can also be inhibited by certain antibiotics (eg, novobiocin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> at serum concentrations exceeding therapeutic levels) and by chronic persistent hepatitis, advanced cirrhosis, and Wilson's disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH CONJUGATED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of acquired disorders with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be categorized according to their histopathology and pathophysiology: biliary obstruction (extrahepatic cholestasis), intrahepatic cholestasis, and hepatocellular injury. The differential diagnosis of extrahepatic and intrahepatic hyperbilirubinemia is summarized in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73409 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71068 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In biliary obstruction, both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin accumulate in serum. Bilirubin may be transported back to the plasma via an MRP group of ATP-consuming pumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. The serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase can be used as markers for hepatobiliary obstruction. The diagnosis can usually be established with the help of noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-with-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the adult with jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Obstruction of biliary flow causes retention of conjugated bilirubin within the hepatocytes, where reversal of glucuronidation may take place. The unconjugated bilirubin formed by this process may diffuse or be transported back into the plasma.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to biliary obstruction is age dependent. In adults, it includes cholelithiasis, intrinsic and extrinsic tumors, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), parasitic infections, lymphoma, AIDS cholangiopathy, acute and chronic pancreatitis, and strictures after invasive procedures. In children, choledochal cysts and cholelithiasis are most common. Extrinsic compression from tumors or other anomalies are seen in all pediatric age groups as well as in adults. In neonates and young infants, important obstructive processes include biliary atresia and choledochal cysts.

These conditions cannot always be separated clearly from the cholestatic syndromes because of the variability in presentation of these diseases. There are, however, characteristic differences between the two mechanisms of hepatic disease. Hepatocellular injury is typically characterized by the release of intracellular proteins and small molecules into the plasma. Thus, in contrast to cholestatic syndromes, the elevations in serum conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin and bile salts are accompanied by elevations in the serum concentrations of hepatocellular enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).</p><p>With chronic hepatocellular injury, the biochemical profile changes over time as the liver injury progresses to cirrhosis and liver failure. The elevation of liver enzymes, a marker of active liver injury, becomes less prominent or even disappears.
