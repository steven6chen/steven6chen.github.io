The latter is the procedure of choice since the sensitivity of the different ECG criteria may be as low as 7 to 35 percent with mild LVH and only 10 to 50 percent with moderate to severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, if echocardiography is unavailable or too expensive, appropriate ECG criteria can be used to detect increased LV mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical implications and therapy of LVH in hypertension will be reviewed here. The definition and pathogenesis of this complication in hypertensive patients are discussed separately.

Furthermore, the increase in cardiovascular risk is directly related to the degree of increase in left ventricular mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52329 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50941 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8</a>], an effect that is independent of blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The range of findings is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study, 1033 subjects over the age of 50 years with primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) and no previous cardiovascular events were followed for a median of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rate of major cardiovascular events (fatal and nonfatal MI; all-cause, sudden, or cardiovascular mortality; severe heart failure; or severe renal failure requiring dialysis) was significantly higher in the 29 percent of patients with an increased left ventricular mass, defined as &ge;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface area (3.2 versus 1.3 per 100 patient years with normal mass). After adjustment for other risk factors, LVH was associated with an increase in cardiovascular events (relative risk 2.08); for each 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> increase in left ventricular mass, there was a 40 percent increased risk of a major cardiovascular event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50941 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the Framingham Heart Study examined the relationship between left ventricular mass and hypertrophy and sudden death in 3661 subjects over the age of 40 years who were followed for 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 22 percent and the risk factor adjusted hazard ratio for sudden death was 2.16 (p = 0.008). For each 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m</span> increment in left ventricular mass, the risk-factor adjusted hazard ratio for sudden death was 1.45 (p = 0.008) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66486 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>The cardiovascular risk associated with LVH can be reduced by effective antihypertensive therapy that leads to regression of LVH.

In hypertrophied myocardium, there is a reduced density of capillaries. Furthermore, the enlarged muscle mass limits the ability of the coronary arteries to dilate in response to decreased perfusion or during vasodilatory stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; it may also directly compress the endocardial capillaries. Both of these factors can decrease coronary reserve and can have a number of important clinical implications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary occlusion is associated with a greater degree of infarction and a higher mortality rate than seen in the absence of LVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypertrophied myocardium may be more susceptible than normal myocardium to the effects of ischemia. In a study of patients with sudden cardiac death, the patients with hypertension and LVH who died suddenly had less extensive coronary disease and were less likely to have thrombi in the coronary vessels than normotensives who died suddenly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>The development of heart failure with LVH results from depressed left ventricular systolic function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction. The deleterious effect of left ventricular remodeling may be an important determinant of progression to overt heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Regression of LVH is related both to the antihypertensive response and, to some degree, to the type of therapy used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regression of LVH over a period of a few months has been reported with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), the direct renin inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aliskiren-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aliskiren</a>, some calcium channel blockers (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>), and some sympatholytic agents (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a> and alpha-blockers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. Regression of LVH continues gradually over time (three years or more) and may be associated with complete reversal of LVH and other abnormalities induced by hypertension such as left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>By contrast, regression may be less pronounced with diuretics and beta blockers and is largely absent with direct vasodilators (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a>) and some calcium channel blockers, despite adequate blood pressure control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The ineffectiveness of direct vasodilators probably reflects the reflex stimulation of norepinephrine and angiotensin II release induced by these drugs since these hormones may directly promote the development of LVH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-pathogenesis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;, section on 'Role of renin-angiotensin system'</a>.)</p><p>A meta-analysis published in 2003 evaluated the relative efficacy of different antihypertensive drugs for their ability to reverse LVH in patients with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Eighty trials that included 146 and 17 active treatment and placebo arms, respectively, were evaluated. After statistical adjustments for length of therapy and degree of blood pressure lowering, the relative reductions in left ventricular mass index were (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82558 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARBs &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium channel blockers &ndash; 11 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitors &ndash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics &ndash; 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers &ndash; 6 percent</p><p/><p>ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors produced significantly more regression than beta blockers. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain since there is no evidence that more rapid regression of LVH is associated with improved long-term outcomes. The choice of antihypertensive therapy is usually based upon other factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of ARBs in the regression of LVH was evaluated in the LIFE trial, which compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> in hypertensive patients with ECG evidence of LVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The degree of regression, using ECG criteria, was approximately twice as great at five years with losartan than with atenolol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>To further compare the efficacy of different agents, the PRESERVE trial randomly assigned 303 ethnically diverse, hypertensive patients with LVH at baseline to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or long-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> (30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There were no differences between the two groups in the reduction of blood pressure or LV mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac function after regression of LVH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regression of LVH is associated with improved systolic performance, enhanced stroke volume, and no increase in the risk of decompensation if the blood pressure rises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Regression of LVH may also have other benefits, including a reduction in the number of ventricular premature beats, decreased vulnerability to inducible ventricular fibrillation, and a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28</a>]. Whether these changes will diminish the risk of sudden death associated with LVH is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-hypertrophy-and-arrhythmia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effect of LVH regression on diastolic dysfunction, one of the earliest changes in hypertension, has been less well studied. This issue was addressed in the LIFE trial, which randomly assigned 728 hypertensive patients with LVH by ECG criteria to antihypertensive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. LVH regression was associated with significant improvement in left ventricular diastolic filling parameters after one year; there was no change in those without regression.</p><p>Despite this improvement, evidence of diastolic dysfunction was still commonly observed, which may reflect the role of increased myocardial collagen content in diastolic dysfunction, an abnormality that may resolve more slowly than the increase in muscle mass. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that diastolic dysfunction continues to improve over time with long-term (three-year) follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduction in cardiovascular risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regression of LVH, either by ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>] or echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk. The magnitude of benefit was illustrated in a report from the Framingham Heart Study of 524 patients with LVH; during follow-up there were 269 new cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Changes in LVH on the ECG were measured as the sum of the R wave in aVL and the S wave in V3. Compared to patients with no serial change, those with a serial decline in voltage were at lower risk for cardiovascular disease (adjusted odds ratio 0.46 in men and 0.56 in women). By contrast, patients with a serial increase in voltage were at higher risk (adjusted odds ratio 1.86 in men and 1.61 in women).</p><p>Similar benefits of LVH regression versus no regression were seen in an echocardiographic study of 387 patients with LVH (relative risk of first adverse cardiac events 0.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The benefit was directly related to the degree of reduction in LV mass index, whether or not there was ECG evidence of LVH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The observation that LVH determined by echocardiography is an early sign of end-organ damage that correlates with increased cardiovascular risk raises the important question of when this procedure should be performed in hypertensive patients. This issue is complicated by the importance of the technical skill of the operator and the limitations of the technique in accurately measuring left ventricular mass itself or in detecting small changes with therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-recognition-of-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic recognition of cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>). The following are indications for echocardiography:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild diastolic hypertension (90 to 94 mmHg) who have no other cardiovascular risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (including lack of or equivocal signs of LVH on the ECG). The demonstration of LVH by echocardiography is generally an indication for medical therapy, while nonpharmacologic modalities alone can be used if left ventricular mass is normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have no evidence of end-organ damage who have either severe or refractory hypertension or hypertension that is present in the doctor's office but not at home or work. The absence of LVH in this setting suggests either hypertension of recent onset or white coat hypertension. The presence of the latter can be confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with known or suspected concomitant heart disease in whom the heart disease itself needs further evaluation or in whom the type of heart disease might suggest a particular form of antihypertensive therapy. As an example, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) would be preferred in a patient with systolic dysfunction or mitral regurgitation.
