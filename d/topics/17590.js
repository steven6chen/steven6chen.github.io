The clinical manifestations and epidemiology of the infection are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of West Nile (WN) virus infection is primarily supportive. The potential use of several different therapeutic agents has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>]. However, only one controlled study to evaluate specific therapies for WN virus infection has been completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Uncontrolled studies or case reports suggesting treatment efficacy should be cautiously interpreted, since the clinical course and outcomes with WN virus neuroinvasive disease are highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Agents that have been considered include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for the use of alfa interferon is based upon evidence of efficacy against WN virus in vitro and in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Two patients with serologic confirmation of WN virus infection, who presented with deteriorating mental status and progression to coma, were treated with standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon alfa-2b</a> within 72 hours of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rapid neurologic improvement was demonstrated in both patients within 48 hours of initiation of therapy. It remains unclear if the change in clinical status was due to interferon or to spontaneous improvement, which has been documented in untreated WN virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, two patients receiving interferon alfa-2b and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for hepatitis C infection developed WN fever after mosquito exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ribavirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiviral agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> has demonstrated in vitro activity against WN virus, but therapeutic efficacy has not yet been demonstrated in animal models. Ribavirin increased mortality in Syrian golden hamsters when administered two days after inoculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>During an outbreak in Israel, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> was used in an uncontrolled, non-blinded fashion in some patients with WN virus neuroinvasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ribavirin appeared to be ineffective and possibly detrimental.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous immunoglobulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for the treatment of WN virus infection is unclear. In the United States, high titer neutralizing antibodies have been demonstrated in plasma as a consequence of the wider prevalence of WN virus since the original 1999 outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A potential role has been suggested for the use of IVIG for the prevention and treatment of WN virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with neuroinvasive disease failed to find benefit of a high titered IVIG derived from Israeli donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, we would not administer IVIG routinely given the lack of proven benefit. Nevertheless, because of a theoretical benefit with this use of this agent in patients with humoral deficiencies, it is reasonable to use this agent in such patients without contraindications to receiving IVIG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious adverse outcomes are limited to the patients who develop neuroinvasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Older age is the most important predictor of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Increased severity of neuroinvasive disease may also be seen in immunosuppressed patients, such as solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>In a review of almost 3000 patients with neuroinvasive disease in the United States in 2002, the case fatality rate was 2 percent in patients with meningitis and 12 percent in patients with encephalitis, with or without meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The median age of patients with encephalitis was higher than that in patients with meningitis (64 versus 46 years). Mortality was significantly associated with advanced age. Severe muscle weakness and deterioration in the level of consciousness among patients with encephalitis are risk factors for death.</p><p>Conflicting data have been published on the long-term prognosis of patients with neuroinvasive WN virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated self-perceived health outcomes among 40 New York City residents who developed meningitis or encephalitis during the 1999 WN virus epidemic and survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At twelve months, only 37 percent achieved a full recovery, which was most likely to occur in patients less than 65 years of age. Long-term neurologic sequelae included muscle weakness, loss of concentration, confusion, and light-headedness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective study evaluated 49 patients with laboratory-confirmed WN virus infection approximately one year after clinical presentation, including 38 patients who did not have neuroinvasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most frequent somatic complaints (present in at least one-third of patients) were fatigue, memory problems, extremity symptoms (weakness, numbness or tingling, pain or myalgia), word-finding difficulty, and headaches. Standardized testing revealed moderate to severe depression in 24 percent. Physical examination documented tremor in six patients. Neuropsychological tests of motor function indicated that 69 percent of patients scored &gt;2 standard deviations below the norm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal cohort study of 156 persons with West Nile virus infection (41 percent of whom had neuroinvasive disease), physical and cognitive function returned to normal in approximately one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The estimated times until 95 percent recovery of physical function was restored were significantly different in participants with neuroinvasive disease than in those without (175 days versus 121 days); however, time to recovery of mental function was similar between both patient groups. Lack of comorbid illness at baseline was associated with a faster rate of overall recovery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longitudinal cohort study followed 103 persons with West Nile virus infection (62 percent had neuroinvasive disease) for up to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Many patients still reported symptoms one and eight years after infection (60 and 40 percent, respectively), possibly related to WN disease. Such symptoms included fatigue, weakness, and depression. Older patients and those with neuroinvasive disease were more likely to report continued symptoms. </p><p/><p>The long-term functional outcome of patients with WN virus poliomyelitis is variable. Most patients have incomplete recovery of limb strength resulting in profound residual deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/1,14,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,22-24</a>]. At one year follow up, 18 of 27 patients with WN virus poliomyelitis had strength improvement, with improvement greatest during the first four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Quadriplegia and respiratory failure are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and recovery is slow and typically incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. A smaller study has suggested that estimation of surviving motor unit numbers by motor unit number estimation (MUNE) may predict functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of infection includes personal protection measures, mosquito control programs, and blood donor screening. It is important to drain standing water where mosquitoes are likely to breed. In a case control study examining risk factors, only spending increased amounts of time outdoors and the presence of flooded basements correlated with infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Surveillance programs that can detect an increase in arboviral activity are important so that prevention efforts (eg, personal protection, mosquito control) can be implemented <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Personal protection measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Personal protection measures to avoid mosquito exposure are a mainstay of prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and application of larvicides reduce the production of adult mosquitoes. When human or mosquito surveillance indicates heightened human infection risk, measures to reduce adult mosquitoes are undertaken, usually by truck-mounted or aerial insecticide spraying. These measures may considerably reduce subsequent human infection WN virus risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>] with negligible pesticide exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] and associated insecticide-related illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood donor screening programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood donor screening for WN virus has greatly reduced, but not eliminated, the risk of transfusion transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>].

However, there are some encouraging preliminary data regarding potential candidate vaccines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 45 healthy adults were inoculated with ChimeriVax-WN02, a live, attenuated recombinant yellow fever 17D virus-based vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. All subjects developed neutralizing antibodies after a single injection and the vaccine was well-tolerated. The vast majority of subjects also developed specific CD4+ proliferative and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses to West Nile virus antigens. A larger phase II trial subsequently found this chimeric vaccine safe and immunogenic in adults, including individuals who were &gt;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A DNA vaccine, encoding premembrane and envelope glycoproteins was evaluated in an open-label study in 15 healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-west-nile-virus-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
