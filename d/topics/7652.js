Millions of poisonings and drug overdoses occur annually in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The general approach and initial management of patients with suspected or confirmed poisoning will be reviewed here. Specific issues relating to the management of common drug overdoses are discussed separately (see appropriate topic reviews). Topics devoted to the management of the critically ill adult and the child with an unknown overdose are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accidental and intentional poisoning from both licit and illicit substances remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. In the United States, the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported over 2.1 million human exposure calls in 2016. While the overall mortality rate reported by the AAPCC was 0.07 percent, 30 percent of cases required management at a health care facility and 8.4 percent of cases required hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Between 2008 and 2011 in the United States, there were an estimated 1.1 million annual emergency department (ED) visits related to drug poisoning, or 35.4 visits per 10,000 persons; 24.5 percent of these patients presenting with drug poisoning required hospital admission, compared with 12.7 percent for non-poisoning related presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Rates of poisoning cases among ED patients appear similar in other industrialized nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>As of 2008, poisoning has become the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, surpassing motor vehicle collisions. The majority of poisoning fatalities were related to drugs, with 36,500 cases in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; most overdoses involved prescription drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients aged 35 to 54 years accounted for the highest number of poisonings, but patients between the ages of 18 and 20 had the highest rate. Since 2008, mortality from drug poisoning has continued to rise in the United States, with 47,055 deaths in 2014. In that year opioids, including prescription opioids and heroin, accounted for the majority (61 percent) of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients aged 35 to 54 years accounted for the highest number of poisonings, but patients between the ages of 18 and 20 had the highest rate. The contribution of poisoning to suicide cases varies by region: suicidal poisoning is especially prevalent in Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom, while the burden of suicidal poisonings is relatively less in most of Eastern Europe and Central and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Among adults, the AAPCC reported the most common exposures were due to analgesics (11.6 percent), sedatives and antipsychotics (10.1 percent), and antidepressants (6.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A review of a toxicology case registry noted similar findings, with analgesics, sedatives and antidepressants accounting for the most frequently mentioned exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Reviews of self-poisoning cases in the United Kingdom and Spain found that analgesics, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants were the most commonly encountered drugs in poisoning cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. However, trends vary in other geographic regions. In a study of Norwegian patients, the most prevalent drugs (aside from ethanol) were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, opioids, and gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A German study of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for poisoning found benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antihistamines to be the most commonly encountered drugs, again excluding ethanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A report of Israeli poison center data found that antimicrobials were the drugs most frequently reported in poisonings, second only to analgesics (including opioids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A review of Turkish ICU admissions for found antidepressants and analgesics to be most common among single agent ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In Africa and East Asia, pesticides account for more poisoning cases than medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians who treat poisoned patients should have a systematic and consistent approach to evaluation and management. It is important to note that drug poisoning can produce a wide range of symptoms and clinical findings. Presentation depends upon the agent ingested, whether the ingestion is acute or chronic, baseline prescription medications a patient may be taking, and whether the ingestion involves a single drug or several coingestants. Initial management is focused on acute stabilization. The history and physical examination are of great importance in recognizing that poisoning has occurred. Management is directed to the provision of supportive care, prevention of poison absorption, and, when applicable, the use of antidotes and enhanced elimination techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief initial screening examination should be performed on all patients to identify immediate measures required to stabilize and prevent deterioration of the patient. Assess vital signs, mental status, and pupil size, skin temperature and moisture, and perform pulse oximetry, continuous cardiac monitoring, and an electrocardiogram. Obtain intravenous access and a finger-stick glucose measurement. In patients with suspected occult trauma, maintain in-line cervical immobilization. Assess the airway and perform endotracheal intubation if there is significant doubt about the patient's ability to protect their airway and avoid aspiration. Provide advanced cardiac life support measures as required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with altered consciousness should prompt administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy and 25 g of dextrose (50 mL of a 50 percent solution) to treat hypoglycemia, unless these diagnoses can be rapidly excluded. Administer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> to patients with signs, symptoms, or a history suggestive of opioid intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic measures and antidotal therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The notion that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> must be given prior to dextrose to avoid precipitating Wernicke's encephalopathy is largely unsupported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Uptake of thiamine into cells is slower than that of dextrose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and withholding dextrose until the administration of thiamine is complete may prove detrimental to those with actual hypoglycemia.</p><p>Rapid bedside glucometers are the most expedient method to determine the presence of hypoglycemia. Empiric administration of dextrose is recommended for the patient with altered consciousness when bedside glucose measurements are low or borderline-low, not immediately available, or the accuracy of the results is questionable. Follow-up finger-stick or serum glucose measurements should be obtained in patients with a persistent altered mental status, as hypoglycemia may develop during the later stages of some poisonings.</p><p>Be certain to expose the patient completely and look for signs of trauma, drug use, infection, or extremity swelling. Measure the core body temperature. Patient decontamination should then be initiated (if indicated). Obtain an electrocardiogram to assess for drug-related cardiotoxicity (see section on electrocardiogram below). Search clothing, wallets, and pocket books for pills, pill bottles, or drug related equipment, but take care when doing so to avoid a needle stick. A more detailed diagnostic evaluation can then ensue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF POISONING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history, physical examination, and routine and toxicological laboratory evaluations are used to establish and confirm the diagnosis of poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history, although intuitively the source of the most helpful information for identifying the etiology of poisoning, is often <strong>unreliable</strong> when provided by a patient following intentional ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In one prospective survey, the initial clinical history fully correlated with confirmatory testing in only 27 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The patient's ability to provide a reliable history is often impaired by direct drug effects or psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Therefore, the patient's history should be confirmed whenever possible and correlated with the signs, symptoms, and laboratory data expected from poisoning with the agent(s) implicated by history. When the patient is unable or unwilling to give a reliable history regarding poison exposure, information should be sought from paramedics, police, and the patient's employer, family, friends, primary care clinician, and pharmacist.</p><p>A thorough search of the exposure environment should be conducted for pill bottles or a suicide note which may provide clues to etiologic agent(s). Knowledge of drugs prescribed for the patient or the patient's family or friends to which he or she could have had access may also prove important. Unknown pills or chemicals may be identified by consultation with a regional poison control center, computerized drug or poison identification system, or product manufacturer (eg, material data safety sheet). United States poison control centers can be reached through a toll-free line (1-800-222-1222). The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a listing of international poison centers at its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/&amp;token=SRGt6qYKWhTZXM65CFpL14d8PXUSsrQ0x2rLz73XxeUhuxfrbGVLKHyxP3WySgyuFIpDTJXXB5XK+p5bXcfQV68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=324\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>. </p><p>It is critical to inquire specifically about the use of over-the-counter medications, traditional or herbal remedies, and dietary supplements as these are often not considered to be medications by the patient and may not be volunteered during routine questioning about &quot;drugs.&quot; In addition, keep in mind that patients or secondary sources providing history may misidentify drugs. Over-the-counter products may be confused (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) or prescription medications may be mistaken for each other (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>). Lastly, drugs of abuse may only be identified by colloquial or slang terms (eg, &quot;ecstasy&quot; for MDMA, or &quot;bath salts&quot; for synthetic cathinones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of symptomatic poisoned patients may provide invaluable clues to the agent involved. The mental status, vital signs, and pupillary examination are the most useful elements and allow classification of the patient into either a state of physiologic excitation or depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic excitation, manifested by central nervous system stimulation and increased pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and depth, and temperature, is most commonly caused by anticholinergic, sympathomimetic, or central hallucinogenic agents, or by drug withdrawal states.

These assays are inexpensive and provide rapid results, usually within one hour. Positive and negative screens for drugs do not absolutely confirm or refute poisoning diagnoses and require further evaluation. As an example, a negative screen may reflect a drug concentration below the threshold limit of detection due to timing of the specimen before or after peak concentration. Conversely, high concentrations of certain drugs may be due to a false positive result. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> can cause false positive results in assays screening for tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Thus, comprehensive toxicology screening should be reserved for patients with severe or unexplained toxicity. Urine is the optimal matrix for analysis (as opposed to serum or whole blood) due to the longer window for detection and higher concentrations of drugs or their metabolites.</p><p>Quantitative assays have defined roles in the management of poisoned patients.

The sooner decontamination is performed, the more effective it is at preventing poison absorption. Copious water or saline irrigation for topical exposures and administration of activated charcoal for ingestions are the preferred methods of decontamination in most cases. In certain circumstances, other methods of gastrointestinal decontamination may be warranted, such as gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, endoscopy, surgery, dilution, and cathartics.

However, there are instances in which prompt administration of a specific antidote is potentially life-saving.</p><p>Antidote administration is appropriate when there is a poisoning for which an antidote exists, the actual or predicted severity of poisoning warrants its use, expected benefits of therapy outweigh its associated risk, and there are no contraindications. Antidotes dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality in certain intoxications, but they are unavailable for most toxic agents and therefore are used in only a small fraction of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Antidotes reduce or reverse poison effects by a variety of means. They may prevent absorption, bind and neutralize poisons directly, antagonize end-organ effects, or inhibit conversion to more toxic metabolites.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of both the toxin and the antidote must be considered. Toxicity may recur if the antidote is eliminated more rapidly than the ingested substance, particularly if the antidote acts by antagonizing end-organ effects or inhibiting conversion to toxic metabolites. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> reverses opioid-induced somnolence and respiratory depression, but symptoms recur in approximately one-third of cases because the elimination half-life of naloxone is only 60 to 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/24,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,44</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic measures and antidotal therapy'</a>). Thus, in certain situations antidotes may require repeated administration or continuous infusion.</p><p>Although a response to empirically administered antidotes can be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis, their indiscriminate use can potentially increase patient morbidity. As an example, routine administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> to comatose patients suspected of benzodiazepine overdose may precipitate seizures, particularly if a proconvulsant drug has also been ingested, and is therefore <strong>NOT</strong> recommended.

Supportive care for the poisoned patient is generally similar to that utilized for other critically ill patients, but certain issues are managed slightly differently:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway protection</strong> &ndash; Airway protection by endotracheal intubation should be performed early in the poisoned patient with depressed mental status, unless the cause is easily reversible (eg, opioid intoxication or hypoglycemia), because of the high risk for aspiration and its associated complications, particularly when gastric decontamination procedures need to be undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation is also indicated in the presence of severe acid-base disturbances or acute respiratory failure. Particularly when intubating a severely acidemic patient, it is important to prevent the development of a respiratory acidosis through inadequate minute ventilation. Occasionally, the management of high-grade physiologic stimulation may require sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paralysis with mechanical ventilation to limit the extent of complications such as hyperthermia, acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. One rare exception to this important principle of aggressive airway management is salicylate poisoning, in which mechanical ventilation should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a listing of international poison centers at its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/&amp;token=SRGt6qYKWhTZXM65CFpL14d8PXUSsrQ0x2rLz73XxeUhuxfrbGVLKHyxP3WySgyuFIpDTJXXB5XK+p5bXcfQV68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=324\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3877561085\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-general-measures-for-acute-poisoning-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: General measures for acute poisoning treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-treatment-of-acute-poisoning-caused-by-specific-agents-other-than-drugs-of-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Treatment of acute poisoning caused by specific agents other than drugs of abuse&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While poisonings can be fatal, the vast majority of patients presenting with a toxic exposure suffer minimal morbidity and recover fully. As a result, it is important to weigh the risks of interventions against the potential benefits which, for many patients, are relatively small. Assistance can be obtained from regional poison control centers. United States poison control centers can be reached through a toll-free line (1-800-222-1222). The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a listing of international poison centers at its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/&amp;token=SRGt6qYKWhTZXM65CFpL14d8PXUSsrQ0x2rLz73XxeUhuxfrbGVLKHyxP3WySgyuFIpDTJXXB5XK+p5bXcfQV68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=324\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>The essential elements of care for the poisoned patient include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Institute stabilization procedures in patients with a compromised airway, inadequate gas exchange, or marginal hemodynamics. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a thorough history of actual and potential exposures. Use information from friends, family, and prehospital personnel when available. Always inquire specifically about the use of over-the-counter drugs and traditional or herbal remedies in cases of intentional overdose. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a thorough physical examination to ascertain signs of a potential toxidrome as well as complications of the toxic exposure. Look for signs of trauma. The topic contains multiple tables that describe the association between particular physical findings and potential toxins. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a focused laboratory and radiographic evaluation that is guided by the severity of the patient's clinical status and the suspected toxins. Symptomatic patients and those with an unknown or unreliable history should, at a minimum, have measurements of serum electrolytes, renal function, and blood glucose. A urinalysis should also be performed. Calculation of the osmolal and anion gaps may help guide further evaluation of the toxic agent. An electrocardiogram should be performed on all patients who are symptomatic or who have been exposed to potentially cardiotoxic agents. Obtain a pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other laboratory studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a &quot;toxic screen&quot; of blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine in patients with severe or unexplained toxicity. Limited immunoassay screens are adequate for most cases of intentional overdose and provide less expensive and more timely results than comprehensive qualitative assays using gas chromatography or mass spectrometry. Screening for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and salicylates is strongly recommended for patients with an uncertain history, intentional poisoning, or unexplained toxicity. Obtain quantitative drug concentrations if the results will help guide management. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Toxicology screens (drug testing)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care in conjunction with decontamination procedures is sufficient for the vast majority of patients with toxic exposures. The decision to admit a patient with a toxic exposure to an intensive care setting should be based upon clinical criteria that relate to the stability of the airway, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and the patient's level of consciousness. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Poisoning management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McCaig LF, Burt CW.
