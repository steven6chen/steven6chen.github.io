There are no specific clinical presentations unique or even especially suggestive of a particular nerve tumor, with the exception of neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients present for evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors because of a soft tissue mass, pain, or focal neurologic findings, approximately in that order of frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The duration and progression of symptoms or signs is important as most benign tumors have a longer duration and a slow rate of progression, while malignant tumors tend to progress rapidly in size, amount of pain, and neurologic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Any mass changing its clinical character should be taken seriously, as that is one of the few clinical clues to its potentially malignant nature. In particular, rapidly expanding soft tissue masses are very suspicious for the presence of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and should be evaluated promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A careful family history is important in the assessment of an underlying neurogenetic disorder, such as neurofibromatosis.</p><p>On examination, peripheral nerve tumors tend to be mobile perpendicular to the axis of the peripheral nerve but fixed along the axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ganglion cysts, lipomas, and lipofibromatous hamartomas are usually easily compressible, while neoplastic tumors are often firm in texture. Pain will occur in the region of the tumor and any nerve the tumor involves, but pain may not be specific enough to discern the particular involved nerve. Neurologic deficits of sensory and motor function correspond to the nerve in which the tumor originates or which it is compressing, and as such will often be most useful in localizing the tumor. Obtaining a Tinel sign over a nerve or tumor may also assist in localization to a particular nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A significant minority of peripheral nerve tumors are associated with either neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 or type 2. Schwannomatosis is now considered to be a third variety of NF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schwannomatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schwannomatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353014\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of laboratory evaluation of the patient with a peripheral nerve tumor is to determine the type and location. Imaging is the most useful modality. Electrodiagnostic testing can help to localize involvement of specific nerves or portions of a plexus but is nonspecific for differentiating peripheral nerve tumors. Surgical biopsy is important for tumors that are deep or potentially malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Genetic testing for NF1 or NF2 is available but is expensive and not helpful in the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors, as the diagnostic criteria for both diseases are clinical and most solitary neurofibromas and schwannomas occur in patients without neurofibromatosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353033\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging is the most valuable tool for evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Many tumors are first identified by imaging done for symptoms of pain, sensory loss, or weakness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI is the most helpful imaging modality, especially in denoting the presence of a mass, determining whether the mass is intrinsic or extrinsic to the nerve, and delineating involvement of adjacent structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58553 \">image 1</a>). The MRI is less helpful in determining the pathology of the tumor as there are no pathognomonic signal characteristics for any type of tumor. Although not definitive, MRI can sometimes be helpful in determining the malignant nature of a tumor. Rapid expansion of a known tumor, inhomogeneous enhancement, hemorrhage, necrosis, and heterogeneous signal suggest, but do not confirm, the presence of a malignant nerve sheath tumor. Large tumors exceeding 5 cm, ill-defined margins, invasion of fat planes, and edema around the tumor all raise the possibility of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56406\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56406 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan is not the best imaging method as many tumors have signal densities similar to muscle and so are not well defined. However, CT can be useful in demonstrating bony remodeling adjacent to the tumor, such as spinal neural foramina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has shown some promise in distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) from benign tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Metastatic cancer to peripheral nerve is not common but in that scenario, CT, MRI, and PET scanning take on the additional importance of determining the primary tumor and staging the cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353054\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrodiagnostic studies with electromyography and nerve conduction testing is not particularly helpful in the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumors, beyond indicating which nerve, nerves, or portions of a plexus may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are no specific electrodiagnostic findings for any peripheral nerve tumors and no distinction can be made between benign or malignant tumors. However, electrodiagnostic testing may provide some indication of the function of a particular nerve and as such, may propel the patient and surgeon towards or against surgery.</p><p>More value may arise from intraoperative electrophysiologic monitoring to assist the surgeon in determining what is or is not functional neural tissue. A non-functional nerve found preoperatively needs to be verified intraoperatively but might allow the surgeon freer access to removal of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353061\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical biopsy is important in the evaluation of tumors, especially those that are deep or thought to be malignant, as pathology will determine further surgical options. According to an international consensus statement on MPNSTs in neurofibromatosis, all patients with pain, enlargement of a soft tissue mass, change in texture, or advancement of neurologic deficit should have biopsy to assess for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A pathologist with expertise in peripheral nerve tumors is obviously important, as the differentiation between schwannoma and neurofibroma is key (eg, schwannomas are seen in NF2 and schwannomatosis, neurofibromas are seen in NF1; neurofibromas can undergo malignant transformation, schwannomas do not) and the determination of malignancy can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353077\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for peripheral nerve tumors is largely based on surgical removal. Not all patients with a peripheral nerve tumor will need surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some may best be treated conservatively with observation, such as the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic schwannomas or other tumors with no characteristics suspicious for malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous neurofibromas, dermal neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas with low suspicion for malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-neoplastic tumors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors causing minimal symptoms in older adults, medically impaired, or debilitated patient</p><p/><p>For patients with tumors that do require treatment, surgery is the primary tool.

For benign tumors, removal of the tumor with minimization of residual neurologic deficit is the goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], though that can be impossible given the location of the tumor and intertwining with nerve fascicles, especially if the tumor is nonencapsulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>Treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors is discussed below.

Most authors utilize a system based on the presence or absence of neoplasia, whether the neoplasia is benign or malignant, and the presumed cellular origin of the underlying neoplasia, ie, nerve sheath origin or not (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60755 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353175\"><span class=\"h1\">BENIGN NON-NEOPLASTIC NERVE TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The category of benign non-neoplastic nerve tumors includes neuroma, ganglion cyst, intraneural heterotopic ossification, sarcoid granuloma, inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve, leprosy, hypertrophic neuropathy, lipofibromatous hamartoma, and neuromuscular choristoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353182\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromas belong to a class of tumors best called reactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Traumatic neuromas occur after nerve injury causing interrupted axons (neurotmesis). Regenerating axons lack an endoneurial tube to follow, which results in a mass of disorganized axons that is often quite painful and tender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55239 \">picture 1</a>). Neuromas tend to be small and firm in texture, and require excision for cure and diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morton neuroma is a subject of controversy regarding its nomenclature, pathology, and appropriate treatment. Abnormalities ascribed to Morton neuroma are typically located between the metatarsals of the third and fourth toes or at the bifurcation of the fourth plantar digital nerve. The lesions look like a traumatic neuroma grossly, and are comprised of degenerated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> demyelinated axons, vascular hyalinization, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Clinical manifestations can include pain and tenderness, but similar lesions are common in patients who are asymptomatic. Management of Morton neuroma is discussed separately.

They are benign but may be mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma. Surgical removal is curative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal neuromas are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIb, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait due to a single mutation in the RET proto-oncogene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. Mucosal neuromas present as diffusely enlarged lips, tongue nodules, and thickened eyelids, either diffusely or nodular, usually in the first or second decade. Pathologically, mucosal neuromas are comprised by markedly enlarged nerve fibers. There is no specific treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353205\"><span class=\"h2\">Ganglion cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ganglion cysts are non-neural benign cystic tumors that usually occur in proximity to joints or tendons. They develop from chronic local mechanical irritation in perineural tissue or extend from joints to enter the epineurium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The common peroneal nerve is frequently affected, as are the hands and wrists. A mucous cyst is a ganglion occurring at the distal interphalangeal joint, usually in patients between 40 and 70 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Ganglion cysts are more common in women than men. Pain and neurologic deficits of sensation and strength in the territory of the affected nerve are typical presenting manifestations, arising from either intra- or extraneural compression. Asymptomatic cysts found on MRI are frequent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69811\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69811 \">image 3</a>). Surgical removal or aspiration is indicated if symptoms and signs warrant, but intrafascicular dissection and neurolysis in cysts with intraneural involvement may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353217\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraneural heterotopic ossification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterotopic ossification of peripheral nerve has been reported rarely and resembles myositis ossificans pathologically with a central fibroblastic core, an intermediate zone of osteoid production, and a peripheral zone of ossification. Like myositis ossificans, it is thought to occur secondary to local trauma. Pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the distribution of the affected nerve are the presenting complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353224\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcoid granuloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcoid granulomas can involve cranial and peripheral nerves, which appear firm and thickened. This can be a focal or multifocal process, causing pain, sensory loss, paresthesias, and weakness. The diagnosis may require nerve biopsy. The mainstay of treatment is glucocorticoids, as with systemic sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Disease refractory to glucocorticoid therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353253\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve is another rare disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. The swelling is composed of chronic inflammatory (mostly T lymphocytes) and reactive mesenchymal cells, resulting in segmental fusiform or nodular enlargement. The infiltrate is usually limited to the epineurium. Sensorimotor deficits in the territory of the affected nerve lead to evaluation, and surgery is usually done because of the deficits and the presumed diagnosis of nerve sheath tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353260\"><span class=\"h2\">Leprosy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leprous neuropathy results from infection with Mycobacterium leprae and is a common cause of neuropathy in underdeveloped countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy#H1708854\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leprosy&quot;, section on 'Neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>Leprosy has a tuberculoid and lepromatous form, dependent on each patient's immune response. Tuberculoid leprosy involves cutaneous and subcutaneous nerves, with extensive destruction of nerve fibers secondary to the inflammatory response engendered by the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nerves are often enlarged due to the inflammation and from cold abscesses and fibrosis within the nerve. This is less likely in lepromatous leprosy, which results from hematogenous dissemination.</p><p>The treatment of leprosy is discussed separately.

The fusiform enlargement of the nerve is focal and separable from the hypertrophic neuropathies (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Dejerine-Sottas disease, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) only by the lack of a diffuse polyneuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic inflammatory neuropathy, another rare condition, often involves the brachial plexus with focal fusiform swelling of a nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. Like hypertrophic neuropathy, it is endoneurial in origin with onion bulb-like hyperplasia around axons, but differs in having extensive edema, localized inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrosis. The diagnosis requires tissue, so biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excision is often required to differentiate this entity from a neoplastic lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30353314\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipofibromatous hamartoma is another unusual condition, most commonly involving the median nerve in children or young adults, and at times associated with macrodactyly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These tumors involve the epineurium with fibrosis and fat, and sometimes other tissues such as muscle. Lipomas of the nerve may be hard to differentiate but are often encapsulated and contain only adipose tissue. Patients present with either a mass, enlarged fingers, or neurologic symptoms due to compression of the nerve. Neurologic symptoms are most likely if the distal median nerve is involved in the carpal tunnel. Treatment is by surgical excision, which may be limited to debulking or carpal tunnel release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It usually affects large nerves in children and is solitary. In a study that reviewed 19 cases, nearly a third involved the sciatic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

These are neoplastic tumors often comprised of well-differentiated, firm masses of fibrous tissue. They are infiltrative and frequently recurrent. Muscle and muscle fascia is the usual site of origin. Up to 10 to 15 percent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis will have desmoid tumors. They often present as painful masses most commonly affecting proximal and truncal areas.

Total resection is difficult and may require sacrifice of the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but as the brachial plexus is a common site of involvement, total resection may not be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1265055710\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurothekeoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurothekeomas are superficial tumors of variable pathology, which may encompass a spectrum of disease.</p><p>The terminology is evolving, and the name &quot;neurothekeoma&quot; may over time disappear from usage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Neurothekeomas were originally called &quot;nerve sheath myxoma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but in a later series, 53 tumors with similar pathology were termed &quot;neurothekeoma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

They are also negative for EMA, indicating they are not of perineural cell origin either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], which raises the issue of whether cellular or mixed-type neurothekeomas are of nerve sheath origin.

Solitary neurofibromas rarely degrade to malignancy, but discrete neurofibromas in NF1 can and do become malignant, and plexiform neurofibromas carry a substantial risk of becoming malignant. (See <a href=\"#H30353503\" class=\"local\">'Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>Imaging can be helpful in localizing the mass, as well as determining its extent and any involvement of extraneural tissues. On CT, intraneural neurofibromas are well-demarcated masses that are hypodense to muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Contrast enhancement is minimal, if any. On MRI, neurofibromas show a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. They enhance frequently, and usually heterogeneously. On T2 images, the tumors will often show a characteristic central hypodense region, called the target sign, which is presumed due to dense collagen and fibrous tissue in the center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66568\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66568 \">image 4</a>). This pattern is very suggestive of neurofibroma but has been reported in schwannoma and in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. CT and MRI of plexiform neurofibromas show large multilobulated and conglomerated masses, comprised of numerous neurofibromas, extending along nerves and nerve branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Treatment of solitary intraneural neurofibromas is dependent on symptoms and signs.

Solitary intraneural neurofibromas suspicious for malignancy should either be resected, or first biopsied and then resected if malignant.</p><p>For patients with solitary or multiple intraneural neurofibromas or plexiform neurofibromas requiring treatment, surgical resection with preservation of neurologic function is the goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, this is more likely to be accomplished in patients with solitary neurofibromas than patients with NF1. The greater likelihood of pain and neurologic deficits in patients with NF1 is due in part to the occurrence of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 and to the need to attempt total resection in NF1 tumors because of the risk of malignant deterioration. In a series reporting surgical excision of 123 neurofibromas in 121 patients without NF1, stable or improved motor function and good pain resolution were observed in 90 and 88 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The same series reported 59 patients with NF1 who had 80 tumors removed; stable or improved motor function and improved pain were observed in 83 and 74 percent respectively, but new or worse pain occurred in 16 percent.</p><p>The location of the tumor also has great bearing on the operative outcome. Tumors in the brachial plexus are associated with a relatively high proportion of postoperative morbidity. In one study, removal of neurofibromas involving the brachial plexus in patients without NF1 who had no neurologic deficits resulted in some degree of postoperative weakness in 8 of 31 patients (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

These nodular lesions grow more aggressively than the plexiform neurofibromas themselves and degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST).

On CT, schwannomas are hypodense to muscle, and they enhance with contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On MRI with T1-weighted imaging, schwannomas have an intermediate signal intensity similar to muscle.

Weakness, sensory loss, and a mass are the presenting complaints and findings. On the other hand, soft tissue extraneural perineuriomas typically affect middle-aged adults, with a slight female preponderance, and no neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Intraneural perineuriomas can be distinguished pathologically from schwannomas by pseudo-onion bulbing and by immunohistochemistry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/30,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36</a>]. Pseudo-onion bulbs consist of concentrically arranged perineurial cells surrounding an axon, in contrast to true onion-bulbs seen in hypertrophic neuropathies, which are composed of Schwann cells. Using immunohistochemistry, perineurial cells (and perineuriomas) are positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and claudin-1, a membrane protein of the tight junction. They are negative for S100, a family of calcium-binding proteins and neurofilaments. Schwann cells (and schwannomas) are negative for EMA and positive for S100 and neurofilaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/6,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,36</a>].</p><p>Treatment of perineuriomas consists of surgical excision if the tumor is causing neurologic compromise or pain. Since axons course through the tumor, residual nerve dysfunction may occur. Recurrence is unlikely. However, perineuriomas can be the source of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). In one study, perineurial origin of MPNST was found for 5 of 23 (13 percent) tumors, only one of which was associated with a nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, homozygous loss of NF1 is not sufficient to generate a MPNST and additional genetic hits are necessary, such as mutations in p53 and deletions in CDKN2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-nerve-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
