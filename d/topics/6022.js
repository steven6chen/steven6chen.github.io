It works by causing scarring in the inner lining of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261992074\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a woman get EA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might recommend EA if you have heavy periods that do not get better with other treatments, such as medicines. Signs that you have a heavy period include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a period that lasts more than 7 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having to change a pad or tampon every 1 or 2 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing large lumps of blood, called clots</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261992057\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during EA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the procedure, you will get medicines that block pain. You might also get medicines to make you unconscious so you can't feel, see, or hear anything during surgery.</p><p>Doctors use different techniques for EA. For most of these, the doctor puts a device into your vagina and passes it through into your uterus. The device uses heat, cold, or a special kind of electrical energy to scar the lining of your uterus.</p><p>Another technique is called &quot;electrosurgery.&quot; It uses a device with an electric wire loop or a roller ball to scar the lining of the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261992040\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after endometrial ablation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the surgery, you might have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps for 1 to 3 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light vaginal bleeding or pink vaginal discharge for 2 to 3 days</p><p/><p>In rare cases, EA causes heavy bleeding or a hole in the uterus.</p><p>You will probably be able to do your normal activities 1 to 3 days after the surgery. Many women have irregular periods after the surgery. After 2 to 3 months, most women have lighter periods and some stop having periods completely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261992023\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scarring in the uterus can make pregnancy unsafe for the mother or baby. You should not have this procedure if you want to get pregnant. But because women <strong>can</strong> still get pregnant after EA, doctors advise women who have the procedure to use birth control afterwards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261992007\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heavy periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anesthesia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abnormal uterine bleeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
