There are two forms of the disease: an acute form occurring mainly in East Africa and caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</em> and a more chronic form occurring mainly in West and Central Africa caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86456 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These two species have identical morphologic appearances, and both are transmitted by tsetse flies of the genus <em>Glossina</em>. However, the clinical infections differ in presentation, management, and prognosis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of African trypanosomiasis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, life cycle, and prevention of African trypanosomiasis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;African trypanosomiasis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333420\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is characterized by an early stage, known as the hemolymphatic stage, during which trypanosomes circulate in the blood or lymphatics, and a late stage, in which there is involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). <em>T. b. gambiense</em> causes a slowly progressive infection, and an oligosymptomatic phase can last for months or years. In contrast, <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> presents as a rapidly progressive infection (often with signs of septicemia), can cause early myocarditis and CNS involvement, and is usually detectable within weeks of infection. Both infections are considered fatal without treatment, although rare instances of asymptomatic infection or resolution of <em>T. b. gambiense</em> without treatment have been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and are associated with proinflammatory cytokine responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Outside endemic areas, clinical features among returning travelers may differ from clinical features among immigrants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86652\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86652 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Data on African trypanosomiasis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; some studies suggest a higher speed of clinical progression and a higher rate of side effects during treatment among HIV-infected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2334707\"><span class=\"h2\">Early infection (stage I)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early symptoms of HAT infection include intermittent headache, fevers, malaise, and arthralgia. These symptoms may correspond with successive waves of parasitemia and antibody production. Hepatomegaly and particularly splenomegaly may be observed, and generalized lymphadenopathy may also be present. Other nonspecific symptoms may be present including pruritus, rash, weight loss, and facial swelling. Neuroendocrine disturbances leading to amenorrhea in women or impotence in men may also occur. The duration of this phase is approximately three years in <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> presents as an acute illness with poor demarcation between stages, leading to death within months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333427\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trypanosomal chancre may be the first sign of HAT infection; it typically appears approximately one week after the bite of an infected tsetse fly. It is a well-circumscribed, rubbery, painful, indurated, red lesion 2 to 5 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50285\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50285 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86882\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86882 \">picture 2</a>). It is seen more frequently with infection due to <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> than <em>T. b. gambiense</em>. The chancre can ulcerate and usually resolves spontaneously after several weeks.</p><p>Six to eight weeks after infection, a transient, erythematous, urticarial, or macular rash may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lesions may be poorly defined, centrally pale, evanescent, annular, or blotchy erythematous macules on the trunk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333434\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphadenitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following skin penetration, trypanosomes travel to regional lymphatics, where they proliferate and cause lymphadenitis. In <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection, lymphadenopathy can develop at any site but typically occurs in the posterior cervical nodes. Painless enlargement of these soft, mobile nodes is classically referred to as &quot;Winterbottom's sign.&quot; They are easily overlooked.</p><p>In <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection, lymphadenopathy occurs less frequently. When present, lymphadenopathy occurs more frequently in the submandibular, axillary, or inguinal regions than in the cervical regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333441\"><span class=\"h2\">Late infection (stage II)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late infection refers to involvement of the CNS. The fatality rate is 100 percent if untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Stage II is defined by an elevation in white blood cell count (&gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Activated plasma cells with immunoglobulin (Ig)M-containing eosinophilic inclusions, known as morular cells of Mott, may be observed in CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid'</a> below.)</p><p>Following early <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection, progressive diffuse meningoencephalitis and parenchymal edema of the brain develop, with perivascular and meningeal inflammatory infiltrates, cerebral microhemorrhages, and widespread multifocal white matter demyelination (stage II). Symptoms include headache, difficulty concentrating, difficulty completing complex operations (2- or 3-stage tasks), personality changes, psychosis, sensory disorders, tremor, and ataxia. Meningismus and focal neurologic signs may occur but are unusual. Alteration of the circadian <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> cycle leading to daytime somnolence frequently develops. Convulsions may occur, especially in children. Deterioration gradually proceeds until the patient is in a stuporous or comatose state. Cachexia, wasting, and malnutrition develop as patients are too drowsy to eat. Patients are also at risk for complications such as aspiration pneumonia and other secondary bacterial infections. Travelers most commonly present with stage I disease but may also complain of headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] or subtle behavioral changes.</p><p>Symptoms of <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection are similar to those of <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection, but the presentation and progression are typically much more rapid, usually a matter of weeks. <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection causes an acute, severe febrile disease with myocarditis or pancarditis associated with early death. The illness rapidly progresses to involve the CNS over weeks to a few months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333463\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of nonspecific laboratory findings may be associated with HAT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86654 \">table 3</a>). Anemia is common (present in more than half of patients) and may be due in part to immune-mediated hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and cytokine-related bone marrow depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia may be present, possibly related to splenic sequestration and massive cytokine release. Hypergammaglobulinemia, largely related to raised levels of polyclonal IgM, is also characteristic and can give rise to false-positive results on serologic tests for other diseases. Hypoalbuminemia, hypocomplementemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein are frequently observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333470\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection in travelers and expatriates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection among travelers is usually acquired in game parks in East Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The incubation period may be as short as a few days. Symptoms include fever, headache, and malaise; rash is also common. Progressive neurologic involvement develops in the absence of treatment.</p><p>Since <em>T. b. gambiense</em> can present years after exposure, a thorough travel history should be obtained in patients who present with chronic neurologic or psychiatric symptoms; the diagnosis can be missed when the index of suspicion is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This was illustrated in a case report of an expatriate presenting with symptoms of psychosis; several alternative diagnoses were considered before confirmation of <em>T.</em> <em>b. gambiense</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An appropriate history of exposure should be identifiable given the limited geographic distribution of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86653\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86653 \">figure 1</a>). Diagnosing HAT requires specialized expertise and significant resources such as well-equipped health centers and qualified staff. Such resources are lacking in many endemic areas that are often in rural locales, so many individuals with HAT die before the diagnosis is established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2358528\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of HAT requires the demonstration of the parasite in blood, lymph node aspirate, chancre aspirate, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> and <em>T. b. gambiense</em> have identical morphologic appearances; the likely etiology can usually be determined based upon geographic exposure and chronicity of symptoms.</p><p>Staging of disease by examination of the CSF is always required whenever the diagnosis of HAT is suspected, even in the absence of neurologic symptoms; CSF findings are needed for planning therapy.</p><p>Serologic testing is useful for screening in control programs. Patients with positive serologic test results require parasitologic confirmation of infection for definitive diagnosis. Other diagnostic tests including molecular tools and imaging studies are limited to research settings or use in nonendemic regions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention#H2333238\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;African trypanosomiasis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trypanosomes may be visualized in blood smears, lymph node or chancre aspirates, and in CSF. These specimens may also be cultured with liquid culture medium; cultures may be positive in some patients with negative smears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sometimes, live, motile trypanosomes can be seen with dark field illumination in buffy coat preparations or blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Clinical specimens are potentially infective and must be handled with universal precautions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Blood smear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trypanosomes may be visualized on thick smears of peripheral blood stained with Giemsa or direct thin-smear preparations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85845\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85845 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86899 \">picture 4</a>). The sensitivity of blood smear varies with the stage of disease and the infecting species. Smears are most likely to be positive in early stages of infection when there are high numbers of circulating <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> parasites, since this species is associated with higher levels of parasitemia. Repeat smears should be performed on consecutive days if the initial test is negative, since levels of parasitemia fluctuate. Thick smears can detect parasites if there are at least <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/mL</span>. <em>T. b. gambiense</em> is less frequently diagnosed on blood smear since circulating numbers are often below the limits of detection.</p><p>Blood concentration techniques such as hematocrit centrifugation increase the sensitivity of microscopy to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/mL</span> but require technical expertise. A quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique (which uses centrifugation and a fluorescent stain to identify motile trypanosomes) can also be employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Another concentration technique involves a mini-anion exchange column (mAECT); blood is filtered through a resin that retains blood cells but allows trypanosomes to pass through; the eluate is then centrifuged and examined by microscopy. Red cell lysis combined with acridine orange staining of parasites visualized on a cheap light-emitting diode (LED) microscope increases sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Microscopy combined with buffy coat separation can detect parasitemia to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/mL</span> but is not widely available in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Tissue aspirate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of lymphadenopathy, a lymph node aspirate may demonstrate motile parasites on direct microscopy of wet mounts; trypanosomes may also be seen after fixation and staining with Giemsa. This method is the traditional diagnostic and screening method in <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection since lymphadenopathy is more common with this species. In the setting of chancre, aspiration of the lesion may demonstrate trypanosomes. Bone marrow aspirates may also demonstrate parasites in some cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Cerebrospinal fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the CSF is mandatory whenever the diagnosis of HAT is suspected, both to confirm the diagnosis and to stage the infection for planning treatment.</p><p>The earliest CSF abnormality is pleocytosis. A white blood cell count of &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> is considered evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the appropriate epidemiologic and clinical circumstances, even though this finding is not specific for trypanosomiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cell counts are usually below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphocytes/microL,</span> but levels as high as 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphocytes/microL</span> may be observed. There is often an associated elevation in protein concentration (autochthonous immunoglobulin [Ig]M production in the CSF). Elevated intracranial pressure may also develop. An uncommon but characteristic finding in the CSF is the presence of Mott cells; these are large eosinophilic plasma cells containing IgM that have failed to secrete their antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Trypanosomes are generally scanty but may be observed in the CSF, either on direct examination or following concentration via centrifugation.</p><p>CSF cytokine, chemokine, and inflammatory profiles in patients with both types of sleeping sickness have been examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The most discriminatory marker for stage II disease is CSF neopterin concentration &gt;14.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L,</span> which has a high accuracy for <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infections (sensitivity and specificity 98 and 88 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Sustained elevations in CSF neopterin (at six months after treatment) can also predict relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody testing for <em>T. b. gambiense</em> is available but is not definitive for diagnosis. Commercial antibody tests for <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> are not available, and antigen tests are still in development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Antibody detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several serologic tests available for the diagnosis of <em>T. b. gambiense</em>. The antibody tests cannot be used for a definitive diagnosis because of variable sensitivity and specificity, but they can help guide management in cases with a suspected diagnosis and are also useful in epidemiologic surveys.</p><p>The serologic test used most frequently in the field for screening is the card agglutination test for <em>T. b. gambiense</em> trypanosomes (CATT), which is based upon agglutination of freeze-dried trypanosomes in the presence of a variant-specific antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The sensitivity varies in different geographic areas but is generally 94 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Specificity depends in part upon whether whole blood or plasma dilutions are used; cross-reactions with antibodies against nonpathogenic animal trypanosomes also reduce the specificity of the test. A newer rapid diagnostic test has been developed in partnership with Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND); it uses lateral flow and compares favorably with CATT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Individuals found to be CATT positive should undergo lymph node aspiration and blood smear examination. A high CATT titer, taken together with CSF pleocytosis and the absence of other causes of CSF abnormalities, can provide strong presumptive evidence of HAT.</p><p>Tests to detect anti-trypanosomal antibodies in the CSF have been developed but lack sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Increased intrathecal synthesis of IgM has been identified as one of the most sensitive indicators of CNS involvement in HAT. Elevations in neopterin concentrations may provide some additional discrimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23,25,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Antigen detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques for detection of trypanosomal antigens have been developed but are not commercially available and have demonstrated inconsistent results.

There are two forms of HAT: a chronic form occurring mainly in West and Central Africa, caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em>, and an acute form occurring mainly in East Africa, caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</em>. <em>T. b. gambiense</em> generally causes endemic disease with chronic manifestations, while <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> is an acute epidemic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86456 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAT is characterized by an early stage, known as the hemolymphatic stage, during which trypanosomes circulate in the blood or lymphatics, and a late stage, in which there is involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). <em>T. b. gambiense</em> causes a slowly progressive infection, and the asymptomatic phase can last for months or years. In contrast, <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> causes a rapidly progressive infection, can cause early myocarditis and CNS involvement, and is often detectable within weeks of infection. Both infections are fatal without treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2333420\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of HAT requires the demonstration of the parasite in blood, lymph node aspirate, chancre aspirate, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). <em>T. b. rhodesiense </em>and <em>T. b. gambiense</em> have identical morphologic appearances; the likely etiology can usually be determined based upon geographic exposure and chronicity of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staging of disease by examination of the CSF is required whenever the diagnosis of HAT is suspected, even in the absence of neurologic symptoms; CSF findings are needed for planning therapy. A white blood cell count of &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> is considered evidence of CNS involvement in the appropriate epidemiologic and clinical circumstances, even though this finding is not specific for trypanosomiasis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatments for <em>T. b. gambiense</em> and <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> differ, and the regimen for each species depends upon the stage of infection. The treatment regimens and dosing for different stages of disease are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86457 \">table 4</a>). All drugs used for treatment of HAT are toxic, and there is pressing need for an effective, safe drug for both stages of disease. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment of early <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection, we recommend administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> (rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suramin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">suramin</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For treatment of late <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection, we recommend administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eflornithine-united-states-availability-of-intravenous-preparation-limited-to-cdc-and-who-distribution-programs-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eflornithine</a>, either alone or in combination with nifurtimox if available (rather than melarsoprol) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This approach to treatment is based upon the likelihood of adverse drug effects. Management of early <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection consists of suramin; management of late <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection consists of melarsoprol. There are no alternative agents for treatment of <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection; eflornithine has no sufficient activity against this species. (See <a href=\"#H2359284\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment, patients should be monitored with lumbar puncture every six months for two years. Relapse is present if there is a rise in CSF white count or demonstration of trypanosomes in CSF, blood, or lymph node aspirate. The optimal approach to treatment of relapse is uncertain; this is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2359291\" class=\"local\">'T. b. gambiense'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2359298\" class=\"local\">'T. b. rhodesiense'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769240\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Karin Leder and Dr. Peter Weller, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kennedy PG.
