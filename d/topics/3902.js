The American Psychiatric Association (APA) defines premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as a severe form of PMS in which symptoms of anger, irritability, and internal tension are prominent.

In this setting, symptoms may be more difficult to track because of cycle variability. Biochemical testing is not required in women with irregular cycles during the transition but should be performed in younger women to determine the etiology of the irregular menstrual cycles. We suggest measuring serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

In some instances, women with premenstrual disorders may have had an episode of a mood or anxiety disorder in the past that has resolved. Assigning a diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(PMS)/PMDD</span> is not difficult in this group but often requires that a patient keep a daily calendar that demonstrates luteal phase onset of symptoms with resolution of symptoms in the follicular phase of the cycle.</p><p>However, women who present with the complaint of PMS and experience significant symptoms in both the follicular and luteal phase are likely to have a mood disorder such as major, minor, or dysthymic disorder rather than PMDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. While symptoms may worsen during the luteal phase, treatment should be geared toward ameliorating symptoms of the ongoing mood or anxiety disorder, although in practice, both may be treated simultaneously.

As noted above, PMS symptoms typically start at a younger age, most often by the early 20s. (See <a href=\"#H371524835\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p>It is estimated that up to 20 percent of women develop mood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety disorders during the menopausal transition. But unlike PMS symptoms, which occur during ovulatory cycles, menopausal mood symptoms typically begin when menstrual cycles become <span class=\"nowrap\">irregular/anovulatory</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause#H952676297\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;, section on 'Depression'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of the menopausal transition is a clinical diagnosis, based upon the menstrual history (onset of irregular cycles) with or without menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, and mood symptoms. Documentation of an elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defines premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as a severe form of PMS in which symptoms of anger, irritability, and internal tension are prominent. (See <a href=\"#H84547200\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14174872\" class=\"local\">'DSM-5 criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common <strong>behavioral</strong> symptom of PMS is irritability. Other frequent behavioral complaints include labile mood, <span class=\"nowrap\">anxiety/tension,</span> sad or depressed mood, increased <span class=\"nowrap\">appetite/food</span> cravings, sensitivity to rejection, and diminished interest in activities. (See <a href=\"#H371524783\" class=\"local\">'Most common symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common <strong>physical</strong> manifestations of PMS are abdominal bloating and an extreme sense of fatigue.

(See <a href=\"#H371524783\" class=\"local\">'Most common symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment of patients with possible PMS or PMDD should begin with the menstrual cycle history, and the relationship between symptom expression and menstrual cycle phase. The possibility that the symptoms are due to medications or hormone treatment rather than PMS or PMDD should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H371524913\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both hyper- and hypothyroidism need to be ruled out. This can be done by looking for the typical features of thyroid disease on history and exam and by measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). (See <a href=\"#H774517316\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient's symptom history is consistent with <span class=\"nowrap\">PMS/PMDD</span> and there is no evidence for other medical disorders, the patient should then record her symptoms prospectively for two months. (See <a href=\"#H371524913\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptom recording, we use the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) form (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86743 \">table 2</a>). It is important to use prospective recording and strict diagnostic criteria to diagnosis PMS.
