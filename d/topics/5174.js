A pericardial effusion is considered to be present when accumulated fluid within the sac exceeds the small amount that is normally present. Pericardial effusion can develop in patients with virtually any condition that affects the pericardium, including acute pericarditis and a variety of systemic disorders. The development of a pericardial effusion may have important implications for prognosis (as in patients with intrathoracic neoplasm), diagnosis (as in myopericarditis or acute pericarditis), or both (as in dissection of the ascending aorta).</p><p>Pericardial effusions may develop rapidly (acute) or more gradually (subacute or chronic). The normal pericardium can stretch to accommodate increases in pericardial volume, with the amount of stretch related to how quickly the effusion develops. The ability to stretch is greater with slowly developing effusions. However, regardless of how quickly an effusion develops, with ongoing accumulation of pericardial fluid into a closed space, eventually the intrapericardial pressure begins to increase. When the intrapericardial pressure becomes high enough to impede cardiac filling, cardiac function becomes impaired, and cardiac tamponade can be considered to be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A general overview of the diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion will be presented here. The full spectrum of causes of pericardial disease, management of specific causes of pericardial disease, and the details of pericardial fluid drainage are discussed separately.

Patients with hemorrhagic pericardial effusions have a somewhat different distribution of causes, although the overlap with serous effusions is significant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-pericardial-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of pericardial disease&quot;, section on 'Spectrum of clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the cause of the effusion'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4462926\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of pericardial effusion may be suspected from the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest radiograph. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4462972\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless cardiac tamponade is present, physical signs are so insensitive and nonspecific that they are of historic rather than practical interest. As an example, the ability to percuss cardiac dullness beyond the apical point of maximal impulse is consistent with pericardial effusion, but it depends upon the absence of disease of the lower lobe of the left lung or left pleura and the expertise of the examiner. Ewart's sign (which includes a triangular area of dullness at the tip of the left scapula along with tubular breath sounds and egophony at the same location) suffers from similar limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most patients without a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion will have no symptoms specific to the effusion, but they may have symptoms related to the underlying cause (eg, fever in the setting of pericarditis, etc). Thus, pericardial effusions are often discovered incidentally during evaluation of other cardiopulmonary diseases. However, patients with a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade usually present with signs and symptoms related to impaired cardiac function (ie, fatigue, dyspnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, edema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4463173\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in patients with a pericardial effusion are sinus tachycardia, low QRS voltage, and electrical alternans.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low voltage &ndash; Low voltage of the QRS complexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74856\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74856 \">waveform 1</a>) is present when the total amplitude of the QRS complexes in each of the six limb leads is 5 mm (0.5 mV) or less. Low voltage in the limb leads may or may not be accompanied by low voltage in the chest leads (defined as a total QRS amplitude of 10 mm or less in V1 to V6).<br/><br/>The combination of low voltage and sinus tachycardia should raise concern about pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. In one prospective cohort study of 43 patients with a pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade was present in 23 patients, with low QRS voltage in 14 of those 23 (61 percent) but in none with an effusion without cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After treatment with either pericardiocentesis or anti-inflammatory medication, low voltage resolved within one week. However, the combination of low voltage and sinus tachycardia is not specific to patients with pericardial effusion, as this may also be seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pleural effusion, cardiomyopathy, and prior cardiac surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80629 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical alternans &ndash; Another ECG pattern that can occur with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade is electrical alternans, which is also usually present with sinus tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72525\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72525 \">waveform 2</a>). This abnormality is characterized by a cyclic beat-to-beat shift in the QRS axis (and more subtly in other waveforms) in the limb and precordial leads in association with mechanical swinging of the heart to-and-fro, usually in a large pericardial effusion. The pattern is usually most apparent in one or more of the precordial leads.<br/><br/>Electrical alternans with sinus tachycardia is a highly specific sign of pericardial effusion, usually with cardiac tamponade, but is only modestly sensitive. As a result, its absence does not exclude cardiac tamponade. QRS alternans with other tachycardias (eg, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias or ventricular tachycardia) is a nonspecific finding resulting from alternation in conduction on a beat-to-beat basis, not from mechanical movement of the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4463320\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings on chest radiograph are variable, depending on the etiology and size of the effusion and underlying comorbidities. Small to moderate effusions (less than 200 to 300 mL) may not result in significant findings on the chest radiograph, while larger pericardial effusions typically present with an enlarged cardiac silhouette with clear lung fields (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57640\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57640 \">image 1</a>). However, an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiograph is not specific and cannot be considered diagnostic for the presence of a pericardial effusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial effusion should be suspected in the following clinical settings, particularly in patients with any of the disorders known to involve the pericardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67851 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All cases of acute pericarditis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained new radiographic cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained persistent fever with or without an obvious source of infection, which also raises the possibility of purulent pericarditis.

We perform echocardiography in all patients with suspected pericardial disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76287\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76287 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This practice is consistent with the 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography &ndash; Echocardiography is both specific and sensitive for the detection of pericardial effusion and can also provide information regarding the hemodynamic significance of the effusion. Pericardial fluid appears on an echocardiogram as an echolucent space between the pericardium and the epicardium. Small collections of pericardial fluid, which can be physiologic (25 to 50 mL), may be visible during ventricular systole. Effusions exceeding 25 to 50 mL are seen as an echo-free space throughout the cardiac cycle. Typically, a small (50 to 100 mL) free-flowing pericardial effusion is seen posterior to the left ventricle; this space diminishes and finally disappears as the echo beam approaches the base of the left ventricle and the left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61763\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61763 \">image 2</a>). Accumulation of pericardial fluid above the right atrium in the apical four chamber view with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position is, perhaps, the single most sensitive and specific indication of a pericardial effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82562 \">image 3</a>). However, in the case of a free flowing effusion, the site of accumulation may be positional as there is gravity dependence. As the effusion increases in size, it is typically seen anterior to the right ventricle. (See <a href=\"#H23112237\" class=\"local\">'Quantification of the pericardial effusion'</a> below.)<br/><br/>Although M mode echocardiography can identify an effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61898\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61898 \">figure 1</a>), two-dimensional echocardiography permits a better estimate of the size of the effusion, its distribution, and its distance from potential puncture sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76287\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76287 \">movie 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the pericardium&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>In patients with non-diagnostic transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in whom the suspicion of a pericardial effusion remains high, and in effusions containing clots (eg, after cardiac surgery), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is helpful in making the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cross-sectional imaging &ndash; In cases with a high suspicion for pericardial effusion but non-diagnostic echocardiography, additional thoracic imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful in establishing the presence of an effusion. We do not routinely perform CT or MRI unless both TTE and TEE are non-diagnostic, or unless there is concern for other pericardial pathology (eg, pericardial thickening and constrictive pericarditis). CT and MRI may be useful when quantification and localization of pericardial fluid is important, when the effusion is complex, and when epicardial fat and pleural effusions need to be excluded. These imaging modalities (especially MRI) also are capable of characterizing the nature of the effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H274012956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac biomarkers &ndash; Among patients with pericardial effusion, cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, troponin) may be elevated in those in whom the effusion occurs in association with acute myopericarditis or myocardial infarction. Troponin elevations, typically modest, may occur in association with a variety of other acute illnesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H2298771\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cardiac biomarkers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23112237\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantification of the pericardial effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While echocardiography is an excellent method for detection and estimation of the size of pericardial effusions, it cannot precisely quantitate effusions because it is usually difficult to visualize and measure the entire pericardial sac in any one sector scan plane. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have advantages for fluid quantification. However, if quantitation is desirable or required, a reasonable echocardiographic approach is to grade effusions as small, medium, or large as determined by the size of the echo-free space surrounding the heart.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small effusions (50 to 100 mL) are only seen posteriorly, typically less than 10 mm in thickness, and only cause minimal separation between the epicardial (visceral) pericardium and the thicker parietal pericardial sac. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate effusions (100 to 500 mL) tend to be seen along the length of the posterior wall but not anteriorly; the echo-free space is 10 to 20 mm at its greatest width.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large effusions (&gt;500 mL) tend to be seen circumferentially (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56462\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56462 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57021\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57021 \">image 5</a>); the echo-free space is greater than 20 mm at its greatest width.</p><p/><p>Though size is relevant, as mentioned earlier, the hemodynamic consequence of a pericardial effusion is also related to the rate of fluid accumulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing hemodynamic impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once it is determined that a pericardial effusion is present, the next step is to determine its hemodynamic significance. The potential hemodynamic impact of an effusion ranges from none to mild compromise to the most extreme manifestation, cardiac tamponade (which, when severe enough, causes shock and circulatory collapse). Cardiac tamponade occurs when the intrapericardial pressure due to the accumulating pericardial effusion is elevated enough to impair filling of the cardiac chambers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Factors that determine the degree of hemodynamic compromise include the volume of pericardial fluid, the rate at which the effusion accumulates, and whether or not the pericardium is scarred or adherent. Localized pericardial adhesions or organization of the pericardial fluid can result in localized, and thus atypical, tamponade. Diffuse pericardial inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scarring with effusion can result in effusive constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Effusive constrictive pericarditis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute versus subacute cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac tamponade can occur acutely (eg, due to rupture of the heart or aorta, trauma, or as a complication of catheter or pacemaker procedures) or subacutely (eg, due to neoplasm, uremia, or idiopathic pericarditis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cardiac tamponade is by definition rapid in onset, may be associated with chest pain and dyspnea, and is life-threatening if not promptly treated. The jugular venous pressure is markedly elevated, while hypotension is common due to the decline in cardiac output. The heart sounds are often muted. In most acute cases, the effusion is relatively small because the pericardium cannot stretch rapidly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute cardiac tamponade is a less dramatic process. Patients may be asymptomatic or complain of dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, fatigability, or other symptoms referable to increased filling pressures and limited cardiac output. Peripheral edema may be seen with more chronic cardiac tamponade. The physical examination in subacute cardiac tamponade may reveal hypotension with a narrow pulse pressure, reflecting the limited stroke volume. However, patients with preexisting hypertension may remain hypertensive due to the increased sympathetic activity that is usually present in cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis of cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is based upon clinical and imaging evidence.

Frequently, the cause of a pericardial effusion is suspected by the clinical setting in which it occurs. Examples include patients with breast or lung cancer, a recent myocardial infarction, severe hypothyroidism, or end-stage renal disease. In other cases, the diagnosis may be less apparent. In cases where the cause is not apparent, confirming the precise etiology of a pericardial effusion generally requires sampling of the effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the pericardium for laboratory analysis. The frequency of different causes of pericardial effusion varies in published reports, depending in part upon geography and patient demographics, as well as the aggressiveness with which an underlying diagnosis is sought (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78847 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

The likelihood of establishing a specific cause appears to increase with larger effusions. In series of patients with acute pericarditis (including those with small or undetectable effusions), the underlying diagnosis was established in only about 15 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In contrast, studies evaluating moderate to large pericardial effusions have revealed diagnoses in up to 90 percent of cases when very aggressive diagnostic approaches are taken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Such aggressive approaches are often not warranted in clinical practice, however, given the benign natural history of many of these effusions.

However, pericardial fluid drainage and analysis should be considered for diagnostic purposes in patients without cardiac tamponade if there is significant uncertainty regarding the diagnosis or if knowledge of a particular diagnosis would change the management of the patient (ie, the presence of metastatic malignancy). In addition, pericardial biopsy can be an important part of the diagnostic approach.</p><p>The invasive nature of pericardiocentesis and pericardial biopsy must be weighed against two factors: a relatively low diagnostic yield from the procedure, and the clinical relevance of a specific diagnosis, as many low-risk patients can be managed empirically without making a specific diagnosis. The yield of diagnostic pericardiocentesis has varied in different series, but in most, a definitive diagnosis has been made following pericardiocentesis in less than 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/9,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12</a>].

This allows for invasive hemodynamics to be more readily and accurately monitored and recorded in this environment, along with continuous standard electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Additionally, this setting is preferred should a life-threatening complication arise.

Echocardiography offers several advantages over fluoroscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography permits identification of the configuration of the effusion, particularly where it is closest to the skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring the position of the needle during the initial puncture is easier and more convenient than with fluoroscopy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient and staff are not exposed to radiation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agitated saline with microbubbles, rather than radiopaque contrast, is used to verify that the needle is in the pericardial effusion.</p><p/><p>Echocardiographic guidance allows the operator to select the shortest route to the effusion, generally near the cardiac apex or along an edge of the sternum, as well as the utilization of a puncture site with the largest collection of fluid and shortest distance from the skin. In the largest published series (1127 therapeutic echocardiographically-guided pericardiocentesis cases), the para-apical location was the most frequently utilized location (68 percent), while the subcostal or subxiphoid was utilized as the ideal location in only 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When the apical route is chosen, the needle is directed parallel with the long axis of the left ventricle towards the aortic valve. For parasternal insertion, the puncture is made 1 cm lateral to the sternal edge in an effort to avoid both inadvertent puncture of the internal mammary artery when too medial as well as pneumothorax when too lateral.</p><p>Once the pericardial space has been accessed, a thin-walled pigtail catheter should be inserted for ongoing drainage. This catheter, with a three-way stopcock attached, may also be used for pericardial pressure measurement. Following catheter insertion and initial pericardial pressure measurement, fluid is then aspirated, and pressures are often remeasured every several minutes to ascertain the hemodynamic result. We also agree with the 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, which recommend drainage of fluid in &lt;1000 mL sequential steps to avoid acute right ventricular dilatation, although this is a rare complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/4,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31</a>].

When pressure measurement, fluid analysis, or contrast injection (using saline bubbles or radiopaque media) demonstrate that a cardiac chamber has been entered and this event is followed by pain or hemodynamic deterioration, the central venous pressure should be reassessed.

In most cases, pericardiocentesis does not completely evacuate the effusion, and active secretion of fluid or bleeding may result in reaccumulation of an effusion.

As in other cases of pericardial effusion, management in these settings is based upon the treatment of the underlying disorder, with percutaneous drainage of the effusion reserved for hemodynamically significant or persistently symptomatic effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Pericardial effusions that are present for weeks to months, or longer, are referred to as chronic effusions or chronic effusive pericarditis. In such cases, the diagnostic work-up often fails to reveal the cause, although an etiology may emerge over time. </p><p>The incidence and significance of chronic effusions were illustrated in a series of 1108 patients who initially presented with pericarditis, of whom a very small fraction (28 patients, 2.5 percent) had a large idiopathic effusion that persisted for a median duration of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forty-six percent of patients with a large effusion were asymptomatic at the initial evaluation, while 29 percent presented with tamponade and another 29 percent developed tamponade during the course of follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 86 percent of the patients with a large effusion who underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis, a persistent marked reduction in, or disappearance of, the effusion occurred in 29 percent, early pericardiectomy was required in 18 percent, and a large pericardial effusion reappeared in 39 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, 71 percent of patients presenting with large effusions underwent pericardiectomy because pericardiocentesis alone was inadequate.</p><p/><p>Thus, although chronic effusions are often asymptomatic and hemodynamically tolerated, tamponade can unexpectedly occur at any time. </p><p>In patients with large chronic effusions, we perform pericardiocentesis initially because the effusion may not reaccumulate. If pericardiocentesis is undertaken, careful follow-up over days to weeks is essential because of the significant and unpredictable incidence of future tamponade. If the effusion reaccumulates, we perform repeated pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy. The major indication for pericardiectomy is the reaccumulation of pericardial fluid despite repeated pericardiocenteses. For both chronic and recurrent effusions, the 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of pericardial disease suggested surgical pericardiectomy only in patients with symptomatic effusions in whom medical therapy and repeated pericardiocentesis were not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The frequency of different causes of pericardial effusion varies in published reports, depending in part upon geography and patient demographics, as well as the aggressiveness with which an underlying diagnosis is sought (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78847 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of pericardial effusion may be suspected from the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest radiograph. However, in the absence of cardiac tamponade, physical signs are not sensitive or specific for pericardial effusion. Therefore, the diagnosis in most patients is confirmed using echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected pericardial effusion consists of the following steps:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Establish the presence of an effusion &ndash; This is usually done with echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the presence of effusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess the hemodynamic impact of the effusion &ndash; Both clinical and echocardiographic findings can be helpful in assessing the hemodynamic impact of a pericardial effusion. The most important issue is the assessment for cardiac tamponade, which occurs when the intrapericardial pressure from an accumulating pericardial effusion impedes filling of one or usually both ventricles. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Assessing hemodynamic impact'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Establish the cause of the effusion &ndash; In some cases, the most likely cause of the pericardial effusion will be clear due to the presence of another illness or systemic disorder known to involve the pericardium. If the cause is not apparent, the routine use of a broad panel of screening laboratory tests is not usually helpful. In such cases, evaluation of the pericardial fluid and pericardium itself may suggest an etiology, particularly if the effusion is large. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the cause of the effusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of a pericardial effusion involves the management of the hemodynamic consequences (ie, cardiac tamponade) of the effusion, treatment of the underlying disease, and management of large asymptomatic effusions or recurrent effusions. The indications for urgent pericardial fluid drainage depend on the level of hemodynamic compromise associated with the effusion (see <a href=\"#H4464578\" class=\"local\">'Indications and objectives'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a pericardial effusion and evidence of hemodynamic compromise (ie, cardiac tamponade) should undergo urgent drainage of the pericardial effusion for therapeutic (and potentially diagnostic) purposes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a pericardial effusion who are hemodynamically stable with no evidence of cardiac tamponade do <strong>not</strong> require immediate drainage of the effusion for therapeutic purposes. However, sampling of the effusion may be indicated for diagnostic purposes in patients without a clear etiology for the effusion. Patients in whom the initial approach is observation should undergo serial echocardiographic studies (every five to seven days or sooner if clinically indicated), avoid volume depletion (including avoidance or judicious use of diuretics), and receive therapy aimed at the underlying cause (if known) of the pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"#H7646065\" class=\"local\">'Initial management of asymptomatic patients with large effusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of hemodynamically stable pericardial effusions should focus on treatment of the underlying condition rather than the effusion itself. This may result in clinical improvement and resolution of the effusion without the need for percutaneous or surgical drainage. Treatment of the illnesses associated with pericardial effusions is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H2067265\" class=\"local\">'Underlying disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the greatest experience has previously been with fluoroscopic guidance and a subcostal approach, pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance is now the preferred method in many institutions. Echocardiographic guidance allows the operator to select the shortest route to the effusion, generally near the cardiac apex or along an edge of the sternum, as well as utilizing a puncture site with the largest collection of fluid and shortest distance from the skin. We recommend using an echocardiographically-guided approach for pericardiocentesis whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H5106762\" class=\"local\">'Pericardiocentesis technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardiocentesis does not completely evacuate the effusion in most cases, and active secretion of fluid or bleeding may result in reaccumulation of an effusion. For these reasons, we recommend that the pericardial catheter be left in place for 24 to 48 hours or until the volume of drainage is less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span>. (See <a href=\"#H5107007\" class=\"local\">'Management following pericardiocentesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusions that are present for three months or more are referred to as chronic effusions or chronic effusive pericarditis. In patients with large chronic effusions, we perform pericardiocentesis initially because the effusion may not reaccumulate. If pericardiocentesis is undertaken, careful follow-up over days to weeks is essential because of the significant and unpredictable incidence of future tamponade. If the effusion reaccumulates, we perform repeated pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy.
