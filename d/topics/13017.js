Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed through peripheral veins in the arms, legs, or scalp. Central venous catheters are widely used to provide intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, and medications to term and preterm infants who require intensive care. In a series of 193 infants with central venous catheters, central venous or intracardiac thrombosis occurred in 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The presenting sign may be loss of patency of the catheter. Other signs may include swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> color changes in the affected extremity.</p><p>Symptomatic thrombosis in the inferior vena cava (IVC) typically presents as swelling of the lower limbs and lower body. Superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis typically presents as swelling of the arm, neck, and head. The severity of the swelling depends upon the size of the thrombus. Chylothorax may be the presenting sign of SVC thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The long-term outcome of venous thromboembolic disease in newborns depends upon the location.

Umbilical and peripheral (radial, posterior tibial) artery catheters are typically used for monitoring of blood pressure and blood gases; the femoral artery is often used for cardiac catheterization.</p><p>The incidence of arterial thrombosis is variable and depends in part upon the method of detection used.

This was illustrated in a large retrospective review that reported an overall estimated incidence of portal vein thrombosis detected by abdominal ultrasonography of 3.6 per 1000 admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of the 133 infants identified with portal vein thrombosis, an umbilical vein catheter was inserted in 97 (73 percent) and in half of these cases, catheter placement was placed in a site with low venous flow rate such as an intrahepatic location. Poor outcome was reported in 36 infants as either hepatic lobar atrophy (30 cases) or portal hypertension (6 cases). In a subsequent follow-up report of 70 neonates from the original cohort who were followed for an average of 5 years, five neonates (7 percent) with previously normal ultrasounds had progressive splenomegaly, and two neonates with portal hypertension required porta-caval shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this study, the overall incidence of 3.6 per 1000 admissions may be underestimated because not all admitted infants had abdominal ultrasounds. In another study, the incidence of portal vein thrombosis with appropriate placement of umbilical vein catheter was 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, patients with thrombosis that is not catheter-related and those with recurrence generally should be evaluated. Because it is difficult to interpret values of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors in the neonatal period and in the setting of acute thrombosis, we prefer to delay testing for prothrombotic disorders in most cases until the child is older, except when the thrombosis is severe or recurrent. The benefits of testing are uncertain. Inherited prothrombotic disorders are associated with recurrence (except factor V Leiden and lipoprotein(a)). However, among patients who present with thrombosis as a neonate, the recurrence risk is low (3 percent) and often a distant event, occurring at the earliest in the teenage years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/17,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,60</a>].

The risk is dramatically increased by the presence of an indwelling catheter, or by medical conditions predisposing to thrombosis, including prematurity and sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Coagulation in newborns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most venous thrombi are asymptomatic. Many are associated with an indwelling venous catheter, in which case a common presenting symptom is loss of catheter patency. When symptomatic, thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) or superior vena cava (SVC) may present with swelling of the affected extremities. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Venous thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right atrial thrombosis is associated with central venous catheter placement. It can present as a new murmur, heart failure, or persistent sepsis, as well as malfunction of the catheter. (See <a href=\"#H2423394033\" class=\"local\">'Right atrial thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial thrombosis is almost always associated with arterial catheters, such as umbilical and peripheral artery catheters are typically used for monitoring of blood pressure and blood gases or femoral artery is often used for cardiac catheterization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial thrombosis associated with umbilical artery catheters may be asymptomatic, or may present with ischemia or organ dysfunction, depending on the location of the thrombus. (See <a href=\"#H2423394140\" class=\"local\">'Umbilical artery catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial thrombosis associated with peripheral artery catheters may present with decreased or absent peripheral pulses, diminished perfusion with a prolonged capillary refill time, and a cool, pale extremity. If severe, thrombosis in an extremity can result in long-term arterial insufficiency and may impair growth of the affected limb. (See <a href=\"#H2423394211\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral artery occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal vein thrombosis is a complication of umbilical vein catheterization and develops in approximately 1 percent of infants with appropriately placed catheters; rates are higher if the catheter is placed in a zone of lower flow such as the liver. Portal vein thrombosis may lead to hepatic lobar atrophy or portal hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Portal vein thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) accounts for approximately 10 percent of venous thrombosis in newborns and is the most common form of thrombosis not associated with a vascular catheter. RVT typically presents with flank mass, hematuria, or thrombocytopenia. Risk factors for RVT include prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, dehydration, sepsis, polycythemia, cyanotic congenital heart disease, maternal diabetes, and inherited prothrombotic conditions. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Renal vein thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal purpura fulminans in newborns is a rare life-threatening condition characterized by disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhagic skin necrosis. It usually occurs on the first day of life and is characterized by ecchymoses, extensive venous and arterial thromboses, laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and extremely low levels of protein C or protein S antigen. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Purpura fulminans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia often accompanies thrombosis and should prompt an evaluation for thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H2423394278\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of thrombosis is suspected based on risk factors (eg, the presence of an indwelling catheter) and clinical symptoms, and confirmed by imaging. Ultrasound imaging is used in most cases, although its accuracy may be limited by the presence of an indwelling catheter. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions regarding evaluation for prothrombotic disorders in newborns with clinically significant thrombosis are made on a case by case basis. We pursue testing for those with thrombosis that is not related to an indwelling catheter or is recurrent.
