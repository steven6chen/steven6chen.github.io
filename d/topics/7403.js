Papillary and follicular cancers are considered differentiated cancers. Follicular thyroid cancer is less common than papillary thyroid cancer. In iodine-sufficient areas, up to 12 percent of all thyroid cancers are follicular cancers, whereas 85 percent are papillary. The molecular pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and prognostic features of follicular thyroid cancer will be provided here. Papillary thyroid cancer and the management of differentiated thyroid cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papillary-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Papillary thyroid cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1109400309\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular thyroid cancer tends to occur in an older population when compared with other differentiated thyroid cancers. Its peak incidence is between ages 40 and 60 years, as compared with papillary thyroid cancer incidence peaking earlier, between the ages of 30 to 50 years. In addition, follicular thyroid cancer is approximately three times more common in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Iodine may also play a role in the epidemiology of follicular thyroid cancer. In iodine-deficient regions of the world, there is a higher prevalence of follicular cancer compared with iodine-sufficient regions. With the introduction of iodine, some studies showed that the incidence of follicular thyroid cancer decreased, while papillary thyroid cancer increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In a report based upon the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1980 and 2009, there was an increase in follicular thyroid cancer rates among women and men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, in a report from Poland, rates of follicular thyroid cancer actually decreased between 1982 and 2012, a time during which rates of papillary thyroid cancer were increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Radiation exposure of the thyroid during childhood is the most clearly defined environmental factor associated with benign and malignant thyroid tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papillary-thyroid-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Papillary thyroid cancer&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most follicular thyroid cancers are probably of monoclonal origin. In addition, oncogene activation is common.

These mutations (<em>N-RAS</em>, <em>H-RAS,</em> and <em>K-RAS</em>, in order of decreasing frequency) occur more commonly in follicular thyroid cancers than in follicular adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. <em>RAS</em> mutations are not specific to follicular thyroid cancer; they also account for a small portion of papillary thyroid cancers, particularly the follicular-variant papillary thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><em>RAS</em> mutations in follicular thyroid cancer appear to be associated with more aggressive cancers and higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It is thought that PAX8-PPAR gamma 1 induces a negative effect on thiazolidinedione activation by PPAR gamma, leading to loss of growth inhibitory controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The fact that follicular thyroid cancer contains either <em>RAS</em> mutations or a PAX8-PPAR gamma 1 rearrangement, but not both, indicates that similar, yet distinct molecular events may originate with these two oncogenes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other factors, such as p53, c-myc, c-fos, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor mutations, have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

The majority of patients with functional thyroid cancer metastases have had high serum triiodothyronine (T3) but normal thyroxine (T4) concentrations (T3-thyrotoxicosis).

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

It is more common in iodine-deficient areas and tends to occur in an older population when compared with papillary thyroid cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1109400309\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most follicular thyroid cancers contain either <em>RAS</em> mutations or a PAX8-PPAR gamma 1 rearrangement but not both, indicating that similar yet distinct molecular events may originate with these two oncogenes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with follicular thyroid cancer typically present with a thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy alone cannot distinguish between follicular adenomas and cancers. These FNA specimens are often indeterminant lesions, categorized as follicular neoplasms or follicular lesions of undetermined significance (FLUS). The actual diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer requires histologic evaluation of the thyroid after surgery and the identification of tumor capsule <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular invasion. (See <a href=\"#H4102579329\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2714680978\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important prognostic features include stage, age, and tumor characteristics (tumor size, vascular invasion, capsular extension, histologic grade, H&uuml;rthle cell or insular variant, and distant metastases). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment options available for follicular thyroid cancer are the same as for all differentiated thyroid cancers. The management of differentiated thyroid cancer is discussed separately.
