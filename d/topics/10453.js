Therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent events in such patients is referred to as secondary prevention. Secondary prevention interventions are aimed at known modifiable risk factors for CVD events such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). LDL-C lowering has been shown in large clinical trials to reduce the risk of CVD events and, in some populations, to reduce all-cause mortality. </p><p>This topic will review the evidence for the benefit from lowering LDL-C in secondary prevention as well as our treatment approach. The approach to lipid lowering therapy for the subgroup of very high-risk patients with an acute coronary syndrome is discussed separately.

To the extent possible, we teach the patient about the nature of the disease, including the potential for early atherosclerotic CVD events. &#160;</p><p>After successful initiation of statin therapy, we remeasure LDL-C.

The potential reduction in risk must be balanced against the burden(s) of therapy, such as cost and inconvenience, as well as a few remaining questions about long-term safety, particularly with the PCSK9 antibodies. The higher the level of residual risk (after statin treatment) in patients with LDL-C &ge;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the more inclined we are to add a second agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3678676025\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with CVD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F91576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91576 \">table 1</a>) should be recommended lifestyle (modification) interventions associated with improved clinical outcomes and treated with a statin.

Among these three, statins are the best studied. They are more effective than ezetimibe and significantly less costly and easier to use than PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, they have been used with an excellent safety profile for over 30 years. Thus, statins are the first choice in virtually all patients with elevated LDL-C. </p><p>In stable patients (outpatients), we attempt to treat with high intensity statin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 40 to 80 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> 20 to 40 mg daily) and we prefer the highest approved dose in most cases. Some experts start at the lower dosage of high intensity statin, particularly in patients 75 years of age or older or when drug-drug interactions may increase the blood levels of the statin. In patients with very recent acute coronary syndrome, we start with atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg. </p><p>Specific comments regarding the administration of these drugs are found elsewhere.

This is particularly true for very high-risk individuals. (See <a href=\"#H3080856564\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.) In addition, there are patients who cannot take high-intensity statin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or whose LDL-C remains significantly above 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> on high intensity statin. Additional LDL-C lowering with non-statin therapy may be indicated for these patients. There are two therapies that have demonstrated improved cardiovascular outcomes when added (individually) to statin: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> and PCSK9 inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Pending the results of longer-term outcome studies, we typically prescribe this class of drug for patients at the highest risk of a CVD event (see <a href=\"#H1672372062\" class=\"local\">'Benefits associated with LDL-C lowering'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2404242206\" class=\"local\">'Risk groups'</a> above). If the patient is able to get access to the PCSK9 antibody (Ab) treatment, the clinician can then re-evaluate the value of using ezetimibe in a three-drug regimen versus discontinuing ezetimibe and employing the two-drug regimen of a statin plus Ab. Whether ezetimibe is needed for patients who require addition of PCSK9 Ab has not been well studied and can be individualized.</p><p>The use of these drugs in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia is discussed separately.

As discussed elsewhere, however, the beneficial effects of statins appear to occur sooner than can be explained by changes in LDL-C, and with discontinuation may reverse more quickly as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024822806\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR LDL-C LOWERING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach of aggressive low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at high risk is based on the following points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL-C plays a key role in the pathogenesis and perpetuation of atherosclerotic CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/10,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated levels of LDL-C are associated with an increased risk of CVD events and lowering of LDL-C is associated with a reduction in events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mendelian randomization analysis has shown that a lifelong very low LDL-C is associated with a much lower risk of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials of many classes of LDL-C lowering drugs, including statins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>, PCSK9 inhibitors, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have shown reductions in CVD events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

A mortality benefit has been more difficult to consistently demonstrate. Studies comparing statin with placebo have demonstrated an improvement in survival, whereas studies comparing moderate with high intensity statin (with the exception of acute coronary syndrome patients) or statin to statin plus a second lipid lowering drug have not. There are multiple reasonable explanations for this, including a smaller additional degree of LDL-C lowering in some trials, an insufficient duration of follow-up in others, or the fact that many lower-risk patients (eg, patients with stable disease and a relatively low baseline LDL-C) are enrolled in these trials, making it harder to demonstrate a significant absolute risk reduction. </p><p>Whatever the reason for the difficulty in consistently demonstrating a mortality benefit, we believe that most patients will accept a recommendation for LDL-C lowering in order to achieve a reduction in ischemic events (eg, MI or ischemic stroke), even in the absence of a demonstrated mortality benefit, since these events degrade quality of life in part through disability, drive up health care costs, and likely portend additional ischemic events. </p><p>Among therapies that lower LDL-C and thus CVD risk, the best evidence of benefit in the past 30 years comes from studies of statins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>, and PCSK9 inhibitors. </p><p>There have been several meta-analyses of clinical trials with <strong>statins</strong> in patients with CVD that have evaluated hard clinical end points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/2,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19-22</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1996 meta-analysis of 34 trials involving approximately 25,000 subjects found that four years of cholesterol-lowering therapy would prevent one death, one coronary heart disease death, and one cardiovascular death for every 110, 96, and 117 patients treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Some have argued that, in the aggregate, these trials support the concept that &ldquo;lower is better&rdquo; and that every reasonable attempt should be made to significantly lower LDL-C. Others have argued that LDL-C lowering therapies proven effective in randomized trials should only be prescribed as they were in the trials. Our approach (see <a href=\"#H1052886193\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above) incorporates both of these ideas, recommending proven therapies for patients whose LDL remains elevated. In addition, our recommendations acknowledge that not all patients with CVD are at equal risk of CVD events.</p><p>With regard to formulating recommendations for the goal of treatment, we broadly interpret the evidence as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher-risk patients derive a greater absolute risk reduction with therapy compared with lower-risk patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The more potent the lipid lowering therapy in reducing LDL-C, the greater the CVD relative risk reduction</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2131422424\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the evidence does not clearly identify a threshold below which further LDL-C lowering leads to little benefit, we believe that efforts to lower the LDL-C below 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> should be made in most patients with CVD. We also believe that in those at highest risk (see <a href=\"#H2404242206\" class=\"local\">'Risk groups'</a> above), a lower target may be considered. There is no single study that evaluated 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> as a target for therapy. This value has been adopted by a broad range of experts and consensus groups as a reasonable goal based on numerous well performed studies of LDL-C lowering. </p><p>All trials of LDL-C lowering therapy have demonstrated better outcomes in the group that has received more aggressive LDL-C lowering (whether the comparator is placebo or a lower intensity of statin therapy).

In a 2010 meta-analysis of 26 trials (nearly 170,000 patients) of statin therapy in a broad range of patients and baseline LDL-C levels, there was an approximate 22 percent reduction in the rate of major vascular events per 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> decrease in LDL-C. </p><p>There was no evidence of any threshold within the LDL-C range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL&ndash;C by 80-120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> would reduce risk by about 40 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Finally, the use of three classes of LDL-C lowering drugs in statin-treated patients has been shown to lead to an additional reduction in CVD events in study populations that achieved a mean LDL-C below 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL:</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the FOURIER trial (PCSK9): start LDL-C of 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> final LDL-C of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.
