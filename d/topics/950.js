However, some patients have persistent or recurrent bleeding. Persistent or recurrent bleeding occurs in 7 to 16 percent of patients with upper GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and in up to 25 percent of patients with lower GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Such patients may require angiographic intervention to locate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to treat the source of bleeding. Arterial GI bleeding can be controlled by selective embolization of the bleeding artery with coils or particulate matter, selective arterial infusion of vasoconstrictive drugs, or by a combination of these techniques.</p><p>This topic will review the angiographic methods available to control upper and lower GI bleeding. The diagnosis of upper and lower GI bleeding, as well as the endoscopic and surgical methods used to control GI bleeding, are discussed separately.

In patients with upper GI bleeding, angiographic control of bleeding is generally considered if endoscopic attempts at therapy have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In patients with lower GI bleeding, angiographic control of bleeding is used as an alternative to surgery in hemodynamically unstable patients with severe bleeding or for patients with ongoing or recurrent bleeding following attempts to control the bleeding endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers#H97407746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers&quot;, section on 'Interventional angiography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-diverticular-bleeding#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic diverticular bleeding&quot;, section on 'Angiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331530\"><span class=\"h1\">LESION LOCALIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, angiographic control of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requires that the site of bleeding first be identified. This can be done with endoscopy, nuclear scintigraphy (tagged red blood cell scan), computed tomographic angiography, or standard angiography. These diagnostic tests are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H25594094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H9942984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Upper endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to attempting angiographic bleeding control, the bleeding vessel(s) are identified angiographically. Optimally, prior to undergoing angiography, patients should have a serum creatinine less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> with an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, an international normalized ratio (INR) less than 1.5, and a platelet count greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/mm<sup>3</span> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If needed, fresh frozen plasma or platelets should be transfused prior to or during the procedure.</p><p>For lower GI bleeding, the evaluation typically begins with the superior mesenteric artery or the inferior mesenteric artery, based upon the suspected location of the bleeding source, whereas for upper GI bleeding, it begins with the celiac artery or the superior mesenteric artery. Contrast extravasation into the bowel lumen is considered definitive evidence of a bleeding site. Indirect evidence includes visualization of an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, filling of spaces outside the bowel lumen (diverticula), early draining vessels (angiodysplasia), neovascularity (tumors), arteriovenous fistulas, and hyperemia (colitis).</p><p>Once the site of bleeding is identified, angiographic therapy can be delivered. In addition, in patients with upper GI bleeding, treatment with empiric embolization (ie, embolization of a vessel thought to be supplying the bleeding source without bleeding having been demonstrated on angiography) can be performed provided the bleeding site was identified endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This can be aided by placement of clips at the bleeding site during endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331951\"><span class=\"h1\">ANGIOGRAPHIC THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiographic therapies include the delivery of agents to mechanically occlude the vascular supply of the bleeding lesion (embolization) or the infusion of vasoconstricting medications to decrease the blood flow to the bleeding site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29023641\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolization works by mechanically occluding the arterial blood supply to the bleeding site. The goal of embolization is to decrease the blood flow to the bleeding site enough to achieve hemostasis while maintaining collateral perfusion to adjacent tissues to prevent ischemia or infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Embolization should only be performed by interventional radiologists experienced with the technique because of the risk of causing bowel wall ischemia and infarction. In addition, the vessel must be accessible for selective catheterization of the bleeding site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29023697\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for embolization include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (transfusion requirement of 4 units of blood or more in 24 hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability (hypotension with systolic blood pressure lower than 100 mmHg and heart rate of &ge;100 beats per minute)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GI bleeding that fails to respond to conservative medical therapy or endoscopic control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active GI bleeding demonstrated by nuclear scintigraphy or computed tomographic angiography examinations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding into pancreatic pseudocysts or from visceral artery aneurysms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemobilia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29023703\"><span class=\"h3\">Agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Materials used for embolization are either temporary (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=absorbable-gelatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">absorbable gelatin sponge</a>) or permanent (coils, particles, glue, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer).</p><p>The biodegradable, long-acting gelatin sponge is commonly used for patients with nonvariceal GI bleeding. It causes hemostasis upon contact when injected into a vessel. The gelatin sponge comes as a powder or as small blocks that are cut to the desired size. The latter is preferred since the powdered form is more likely to lead to bowel infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The gelatin sponge is usually cut in small pieces and mixed with saline and iodinated contrast to produce slurry that helps with delivery of the agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Advantages of using slurry include widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and temporary occlusion of the targeted vessels when desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Microcoils are the preferred embolic agent option for treating GI bleeding by most interventionalists. Selective catheterization and embolization of distal arteries in the mesenteric circulation became possible with the introduction of microcatheters. Microcoils can be deployed selectively into the distal bleeding artery and can preserve the collateral blood supply to the area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Particles such as polyvinyl alcohol are another example of permanent embolic agents. Permanent occlusion is achieved through mechanical impaction. Particles should be used with caution in the mesenteric circulation, as they cause distal occlusion at the arteriolar level, increasing the risk of bowel infarction. Particles are used more commonly in combination with coils and gelatin sponge in the treatment of upper GI bleeding, especially when bleeding occurs from a lesion that is not expected to heal spontaneously, such as an ulcer or tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].</p><p>Liquid agents have also been used for embolization. These agents include N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>] and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. Once delivered, these agents solidify, leading to embolization. A potential advantage of NBCA is that the time required for embolization is shorter than that with other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, its use requires significant training and has been associated with bowel ischemia and non-targeted embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. Ethylene-vinyl alcohol is nonadhesive (so there is no risk of it polymerizing to the catheter tip), has high radiopacity, and has long solidification periods that allow for more controllable and predictable embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), can cause severe vasospasm if injected too rapidly, and it requires special DMSO-compatible catheters. Finally, available preparations of ethylene-vinyl alcohol are significantly more expensive than alternative embolic materials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29023891\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolic agents are best delivered via a catheter or microcatheter that is inserted coaxially through a vascular sheath. An initial angiogram must be performed to confirm the bleeding site and to identify anomalous or variant vascular anatomy. The catheter should be inserted into the selected artery in order to avoid deployment of embolic materials into undesired vessels. </p><p>Microcoils have become the preferred agent for embolizing bleeding vessels and are simply deployed via a microcatheter to the site of bleeding. Similarly, polyvinyl alcohol particles are delivered via a peripherally placed catheter.</p><p>In order to use a gelatin sponge, blocks of gelatin sponge are cut into small 2 to 3 mm strips, inserted into a syringe, mixed with saline and iodinated contrast material, and administered into the percutaneously placed catheter under direct fluoroscopic visualization. The effect upon blood flow is immediately evaluated fluoroscopically; the procedure can be repeated until arterial occlusion occurs and bleeding stops. Care should be used while placing the catheter selectively into peripheral arteries since reflux of the gelatin sponge can occur during diastole or if the material is injected too vigorously, leading to undesired occlusion of additional arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29023897\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications of embolization include those associated with arteriography itself (eg, hematomas, arterial thrombosis, dissection, embolism, and pseudoaneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]), and bowel infarction. In a systematic review that included 927 patients undergoing embolization for upper GI bleeding, complications occurred in 5 to 9 percent of patients, depending upon the type of bleeding (luminal or transpapillary), with ischemia and infarction accounting for the majority of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-arterial vasopressin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> causes generalized vasoconstriction via a direct action upon vessel walls, especially the arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Infusion of vasopressin produces a rapid reduction in local blood flow that gradually returns to normal several hours after the infusion has been terminated. The goal is for the decrease in perfusion pressure to permit stable clot formation at the bleeding site. However, rebleeding once the vasopressin has been stopped is common, and its use can be associated with significant ischemic events. As a result, the majority of patients are instead treated with angiographic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>].

While an intravenous infusion can control upper GI and left-sided colonic bleeding in some cases, it is seldom used clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72428395\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> causes peripheral vasoconstriction that can result in ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. As a result, it should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, congestive cardiomyopathy, severe hypertension, or severe peripheral vascular disease. It can also cause arrhythmias, especially bradycardia, and water retention leading to hyponatremia. </p><p>Fortunately, the luminal GI tract has a rich collateral blood supply, so bowel infarction is unlikely to occur in young patients who have not had previous bowel surgery. Age, vascular disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> use, and previous bowel surgery reduce this collateral supply, especially to the colon. Superselective catheter deployment decreases the risk of bowel infarction, but may not always be technically feasible. In addition, despite superselective catheter deployment, bowel wall necrosis may occur if vasopressin therapy is used following embolization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331712\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice between embolization and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> should be individualized for each patient, taking into account angiographer experience. Although the efficacies of vasopressin and embolization are fairly comparable, embolization should be considered a primary option for treating lower GI bleeding. Vasopressin infusion has significant disadvantages when compared with transcatheter embolization: more complex post-procedure monitoring, longer completion of therapy, and increased likelihood of systemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H72428395\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p>Of note, patients with bleeding duodenal ulcers are relatively unresponsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This is due in part to the dual blood supply of the duodenum, the inflammatory reaction produced by penetrating ulcers, and the frequent involvement of large vessels (such as the gastroduodenal artery), which do not constrict in response to vasopressin. Interventions, such as surgery or angiography, are indicated in patients who have active bleeding from a duodenal ulcer that is not stopped or slowed down significantly with endoscopic therapy. Repeat endoscopy and retreatment of the bleeding source can be performed for lesions that are initially controlled by endoscopic therapy. The patient is usually referred for surgery if the bleeding persists or if rebleeding occurs after two therapeutic endoscopies.

In patients with upper GI bleeding, angiographic control of bleeding is generally considered if endoscopic attempts at therapy have failed. In patients with lower GI bleeding, angiographic control of bleeding is used as an alternative to surgery in hemodynamically unstable patients with severe bleeding or for patients with ongoing or recurrent bleeding following attempts to control the bleeding endoscopically. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiographic therapies include the infusion of vasoconstricting medications or the delivery of agents to mechanically occlude the vascular supply of the bleeding lesion (embolization). (See <a href=\"#H331951\" class=\"local\">'Angiographic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agents used for embolization include biodegradable gelatin sponge, polyvinyl alcohol particles, liquid agents such as glue and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, and metallic coils. (See <a href=\"#H29023641\" class=\"local\">'Embolization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superselective transcatheter embolization with microcoils is the primary endovascular treatment option for lower GI bleeding. Endovascular treatment of upper GI bleeding is usually performed with a combination of coils, gelatin sponge, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> particles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> causes generalized vasoconstriction via a direct action upon vessel walls, especially the arterioles, capillaries, and venules. The goal is for the decrease in perfusion pressure to permit stable clot formation at the bleeding site. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intra-arterial vasopressin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> causes peripheral vasoconstriction, it should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, congestive cardiomyopathy, severe hypertension, or severe peripheral vascular disease. It can also cause arrhythmias and water retention leading to hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"#H72428395\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complications of embolization include those associated with arteriography itself (eg, hematomas, arterial thrombosis, dissection, embolism, and pseudoaneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]) and bowel infarction.
