In the United States, over $3.4 billion a year is spent on repairing ventral hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Ventral hernias occur in the anterior abdominal wall and include epigastric, umbilical, spigelian, parastomal, and most incisional hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Epigastric and umbilical are primary ventral hernias. Incisional hernias can develop anywhere an incision has been made but most commonly occur at the midline, given that midline incisions are most commonly used during laparotomies. Spigelian and parastomal hernias occur off the midline and are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The management of ventral hernias, both primary and incisional, will be reviewed here. The techniques of open ventral hernia repair are discussed in this topic; techniques of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of ventral hernias and the diagnosis and management of other abdominal wall hernias (eg, groin hernia) are reviewed separately.

Among the 2.3 million inpatient abdominal hernia repairs performed from 2001 to 2010 in the United States, an estimated 576,000 were performed emergently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rate of emergency hernia repairs has risen from 16.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2001 to 19.2 in 2010. Among those older than 65, the rate was as high as 71.3 (male) and 42.0 (female) per 100,000 person-years.</p><p>The objective of the emergency surgery is to alleviate any acute problems (eg, bowel infarction, bowel obstruction, abdominal pain) without jeopardizing the opportunity for a satisfactory hernia repair. The optimal technique of hernia repair in this situation varies depending on the anatomy, patient stability, patient comorbidities, and the degree of contamination of the operative field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Laparoscopy should be used <strong>cautiously</strong> in patients with acutely incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernias. Such hernias often have a small defect coupled with a large sac. Distended bowel can easily be injured with trocar placement or manipulation with laparoscopic instruments, which could further complicate the repair. If attempted by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, good surgical judgment is required to minimize the risk of visceral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Surgical options of repairing the hernia after controlling the source of the contamination include suture repair, mesh repair (with a biologic, synthetic, or bioabsorbable mesh), and staged repair (leaving the hernia to be repaired electively at a later date). There is no consensus due to the fact that clinical scenarios are heterogenous and management needs to be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

In several small nonrandomized studies of nonoperative management of ventral hernia, the mean annual incidence of acute presentation was 2.6 percent (range 0 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, patients electing nonoperative management should be counselled that the cumulative lifetime risk of acute presentation may be high, and a nonoperative strategy may fail after the initial one to two years for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1948272770\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic ventral hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ideally all patients with symptomatic ventral hernias should undergo surgical repair, anatomical or physiologic constraints may temporarily prohibit surgery because the risk of surgery for patients with multiple medical comorbidities may outweigh the risk of complications related to unrepaired hernia. Such constraints, however, are relative contraindications and may be mitigated with preoperative optimization. During that process, the hernia is managed nonoperatively unless the patient presents with an acute complication such as incarceration or strangulation, in which case emergency repair is mandatory.

The choice of techniques is determined first by surgeon expertise but also by whether the hernia is primary or incisional and the size of the hernia defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114345\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114345 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H774698\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary ventral hernia &lt;1 cm</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3187921577\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesh versus suture repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small (&lt;1 cm) primary ventral (eg, mostly umbilical, some epigastric) hernias can be repaired with sutures with or without mesh reinforcement. </p><p>Most studies show that mesh reinforcement reduces recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 350,000 ventral hernia repairs (75 percent umbilical or epigastric hernias without specifying sizes), the recurrence rates were 8.2 percent after suture repair and 2.7 percent after mesh repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 300 adults with primary umbilical hernias with diameters between 1 and 4 cm underwent either open suture repair or open mesh repair (polypropylene mesh placed preperitoneally with &gt;3 cm overlap) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. At a maximum follow-up of 30 months, the recurrence rate was higher in the suture group (12 versus 4 percent), and the differences were similar for both smaller (1 to 2 cm) and larger hernias (&gt;2 to 4 cm); hernias &lt;1 cm were excluded due to difficulty in preperitoneal mesh placement. There was no difference in postoperative pain between the two groups. Although not statistically significant, postoperative complications were more prevalent in the mesh group (3 versus 1 percent seroma; 2 versus 1 percent hematoma, 2 versus 1 percent wound infection). &#160;</p><p/><p>Other studies showed mesh repair to be associated with a similar recurrence rate but a higher complication rate compared with suture repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In spite of the strong evidence supporting mesh repair of primary ventral hernias, many surgeons believe simple suture repair to still be appropriate for the repair of small primary ventral hernias (&lt;1 cm), provided there is no residual tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52126790\"><span class=\"h3\">Open versus laparoscopic repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis of three randomized trials and seven retrospective cohort studies found open umbilical and paraumbilical hernia repair to be associated with higher risks of wound dehiscence (odds ratio [OR] 4.99, 95% CI 1.12-22.8), wound infection (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.23-4.48), recurrence (OR 4.06, 95% CI 1.54-10.71), and length of stay (95% CI 1.54-10.71), but a shorter operative time (mean difference -23.07, 95% CI -36.78 to -9.35) compared with laparoscopic repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. When only randomized trials were analyzed, open repair was still associated with higher risks of wound infection, wound dehiscence, hematoma, seroma, and longer length of stay, but not a higher recurrence rate (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.70-3.30). </p><p>Simple suture repair of small ventral hernias is a straightforward open operation. The incision is made over the palpable hernia defect, and the hernia sac is dissected sharply from the surrounding tissue of the abdominal wall until the fascia is identified circumferentially. The debrided fascial edges are sutured together using a mass closure technique. The choice of suture materials and closing techniques (eg, running or interrupted, simple, mattress, or figure-of-eight) is determined by surgeon preference. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;, section on 'Fascia'</a>.)</p><p>Techniques of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair are discussed in another topic.

We suggest mesh repair of all incisional ventral hernias, including those that are &lt;1 cm. An incisional hernia implies failed or poor healing at a previous incision. Suture repair of such hernias will likely result in a recurrent hernia in the near future. Thus, mesh reinforcement is mandatory for incisional ventral hernias, regardless of size. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779488\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventral hernias between 1 and 10 cm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesh repair is recommended for all ventral hernias with a defect &gt;1 cm, as the risk of recurrence is extremely high without mesh reinforcement. Mesh repairs offload tension from the abdominal wall to the mesh and are generally preferred to simple sutured (nonmesh) repair where there is no contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>]. The use of mesh in a contaminated field should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H765663067\" class=\"local\">'Contaminated field'</a> above.)</p><p>Simple suture repair approximates the fascial edges generating tension and is associated with recurrence rates over 50 percent, which is generally higher than that of mesh repair, although recurrence rates following mesh repair can still be 20 percent or higher. Several randomized trials suggest that open mesh repair was superior to simple suture repair with respect to hernia recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/24,36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,36-41</a>]. Mesh is a required element of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.</p><p>Hernia recurrence is likely related to the size of the hernia, which may make the use of mesh particularly important for moderate-to-large hernias (&gt;1 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. On the other hand, mesh repairs are associated with a higher rate of wound complications including infections than repairs without mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/25,36,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36,42,43</a>]. However, it is often possible to treat the superficial wound infection with aggressive antibiotic therapy and avoid mesh removal. Synthetic mesh also provokes an inflammatory response so that mesh placed in an underlay (intraperitoneal) position has the potential for complications such as abdominal adhesion formation and late mesh erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/24,25,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,42-45</a>]. </p><p>The benefits and detriments of using mesh in incisional hernia are best illustrated by a registry-based cohort study in Denmark in which over 3000 patients underwent elective incisional hernia repair and were followed for five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Of these patients, 1119 underwent open mesh repair, 366 had open nonmesh repair, and 1757 had laparoscopic mesh repair. Compared with nonmesh repair, mesh repair was associated with fewer reoperations for recurrences (open mesh 12.3, laparoscopic mesh 10.6, nonmesh 17.1 percent) but more reoperations for mesh-related complications (open mesh 6.1, laparoscopic mesh 4.2, nonmesh 0.8 percent). Given that 57 percent of nonmesh repairs in this study were performed for very small hernias (&lt;2 cm), there was a selection bias against mesh repair, which likely underestimated its benefit in reducing recurrences while exaggerating its harm in causing complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Despite that, the study was still able to affirm that mesh reduced recurrence in incisional hernia repairs. The mesh-related complications reported by this study echo our caution of only using mesh for moderate- or large-sized hernias (&gt;2 cm).</p><p>Similarly, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in ventral hernia repair concluded that mesh reinforcement in clean cases can decrease hernia recurrence (number needed to treat = 7.9) but increase risk of surgical site infection (number needed to harm = 27.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Mesh repairs of ventral hernias vary by mesh material, mesh location, and operative approach, which are dictated by clinical scenarios, surgeon expertise, and available resources. We typically reserve biologic mesh for hernias in contaminated fields or high-risk patients and use synthetic mesh in clean cases. When performing an open repair, we prefer sublay placement of the mesh to other methods. When performing a laparoscopic repair, we place the mesh in the underlay (intraperitoneal) position. However, other surgeons do not share our preference for biologic mesh in contaminated fields, evidence for or against which is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285170817\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesh material</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two general categories of meshes used in the repair of ventral hernias are synthetic mesh and biologic mesh.

Commercially available synthetic meshes are subclassified by density (colloquially termed &quot;weight&quot;). Comparative studies of synthetic meshes yielded conflicting results. As an example, although a lightweight mesh was associated with less postoperative pain than medium-weight mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], the lightweight mesh was also associated with a higher rate of hernia recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of biologic meshes derived from human or animal tissues (eg, porcine, bovine, equine) are also available for abdominal wall reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Biologic tissue is rendered nonimmunogenic by a washing process that is designed to remove cellular debris without damaging the connective tissue scaffold, which functions as an acellular biologic matrix into which the recipient's native tissue grows, eventually replacing it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p>The ideal mesh material should be easy to handle, impervious to infection, resistant to adhesion formation, and relatively inexpensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Current products balance some of these features, but none offers the perfect solution. The vigorous ingrowth of tissue and adherence of woven monofilament meshes make them desirable, but they have the disadvantage of causing significant adhesions to serosal surfaces and organs when placed intraperitoneally. In laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, the mesh will almost always be in contact with viscera. Some meshes have incorporated antiadhesive materials into the side of mesh in contact with abdominal viscera, which allows the surgeon to place mesh in an intraperitoneal position with less concern for dense scar tissue forming between the mesh and bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Although complications related to intra-abdominal adhesions are lower for ePTFE compared with woven monofilament mesh, ePTFE grafts may be susceptible to infection, and removing the mesh is usually needed to clear the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The primary setting for using biologic mesh materials is a contaminated or infected operative field. Long-term data with these grafts for hernia repair in humans are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The major problem with biologic mesh is its gradual resorption over time and risk for recurrent hernia. For this reason, we generally use biologic mesh only as a reinforcing layer, rather than as a fascial replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3234420596\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesh location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mesh can be placed above the fascia (onlay), between the rectus muscles and <span class=\"nowrap\">peritoneum/posterior</span> rectus sheath (sublay), below the peritoneum (underlay or intraperitoneal onlay [IPOM]), or in between fascial edges (inlay). The onlay and sublay techniques use an open surgical approach, whereas an underlay technique can be performed open or laparoscopically. The inlay technique, which bridges the fascial defect with mesh, is used only when the fascial defect is too large to primarily close with any other techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113100\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113100 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>For open hernia repair, we prefer sublay placement of the mesh to an onlay technique. For laparoscopic repairs, we place the mesh in an underlay position. A systematic review of 62 studies, which included two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/36,48,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,48,59</a>], showed that both the recurrence and complication rates were higher with onlay or inlay meshes than with sublay or underlay meshes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113079 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349381124\"><span class=\"h4\">Onlay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the onlay technique, the hernia sac is dissected and either inverted or resected. The fascial edges are approximated with sutures in a fashion similar to that of a simple suture repair. Thereafter, a piece of mesh is placed anterior to the fascia overlying the repair and affixed to the anterior abdominal wall fascia using sutures (our preference), tacks, or adhesives. </p><p>Although onlay mesh placement was historically associated with a high wound complication rate, it is technically easier to perform than the other techniques and is possible to perform without entering the peritoneum. In recent years, the onlay technique pioneered by Chevrel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] is again gaining popularity, especially in European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. In a contemporary case-matched study in low-risk patients, patients who underwent ventral hernia repair with onlay mesh affixed with bioadhesive did not have more wound complications than matched patients who had sublay mesh placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, onlay repair has been associated with increased risk of wound complications based on existing randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349381156\"><span class=\"h4\">Sublay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sublay mesh repair of ventral hernias can be performed with an open or laparoscopic approach. The open technique, first described by Rives and Stoppa and bearing their names, involves first isolating and excising the hernia sac. The plane between the posterior rectus sheath and rectus muscle is developed and carried to the lateralmost extent of the rectus muscle to completely mobilize the posterior sheath, which is then sutured to the opposing sheath, and a large sheet of mesh is placed anterior to the posterior rectus sheath and posterior to the rectus muscle. Sutures are passed through the lateral abdominal wall and tied above the anterior fascia with the knots buried in the subcutaneous tissue. Depending upon the amount of tension encountered, the anterior rectus sheaths can be reapproximated and sutured together in the midline or sutured to the mesh. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522674573\"><span class=\"h4\">Underlay or IPOM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common modification of the Rives-Stoppa method places the mesh in an underlay (intraperitoneal) location with fixation with transfascial sutures. The underlay method is also sometimes referred to as the intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) method. If an underlay mesh is placed via the open approach, most surgeons either suture the mesh to the posterior <span class=\"nowrap\">sheath/peritoneum</span> or use a suture passer to place transfascial sutures. The anterior fascial sheath is then closed over the mesh. </p><p>Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair typically involves placement of a mesh in an underlay position. The technique involves first gaining intra-abdominal access, then identifying, isolating, and excising the hernia sac. For small and medium hernias, the fascial defect can be closed by placing transabdominal sutures (usually no more than three or four). These are tied after pneumoperitoneum has been released. Closing the fascial defect has been shown to reduce postoperative seroma formation (2.5 versus 12.2 percent) and overall complication rates (4.9 versus 22.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Thereafter, the abdomen can be insufflated again to introduce the mesh. </p><p>The mesh should be large enough to overlap the defect (or closure) by 4 to 5 cm in all directions. Reducing the insufflation pressure should allow the mesh to flatten and conform to the natural contour of the abdomen wall, after which the mesh can be fixated with transfascial sutures placed laterally every three to four centimeters. In a systematic review and network meta-analysis of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with IPOM mesh placement, suture fixation was favored over other methods such as permanent or absorbable tacks because of a lower recurrence rate at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>In practice, transfascial sutures are most commonly used in conjunction with intra-abdominally placed tacks. Typically, an outer row of tacks is placed approximately 1 cm from the edge, followed by an inner row, placed approximately 1 cm inside the outer row (ie, double-crown technique). </p><p>For large defects, the fascial edges can be scored with electrocautery to promote adhesion to the mesh. Drains are not typically needed unless the defect is particularly large. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair#H4262544711\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair&quot;, section on 'Surgical techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1679615691\"><span class=\"h3\">Open versus laparoscopic repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open and laparoscopic techniques of ventral hernia repair have been compared in multiple randomized trials and observational studies. The preponderance of data favor laparoscopic repair for its short-term benefits of lower incidences of surgical site and mesh infection, less pain, faster recovery, and either superior or comparable long-term durability (free from recurrence) to that of open repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/46,67-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,67-86</a>]. Thus, for ventral hernias between 2 and 10 cm in a clean field, we recommend laparoscopic rather than open repair. Hernias larger than 10 cm are unlikely to be closed laparoscopically at the fascia; open repair with additional techniques (eg, component separation) may be required. (See <a href=\"#H349380045\" class=\"local\">'Large (width &gt;10 cm) or complex hernias'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, a 2014 systematic review involving 1003 patients from 11 trials found lower incidences of wound drainage (2.6 versus 67 percent) and wound infection (2.8 versus 16.2 percent) for laparoscopic incisional hernia repair compared with open hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The lower rate of infection may be related to the less extensive tissue dissection needed to place the mesh compared with the open procedure. However, the incidence of bowel injury was higher for the laparoscopic group (4.3 versus 0.81 percent). No differences were identified for postoperative seroma, hematoma, bleeding, bowel obstruction, reoperation, or hernia recurrence. A 2011 Cochrane database review and a 2015 meta-analysis of trials reached similar conclusions regarding wound complication and recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. </p><p>Laparoscopy may be a particularly appealing and more appropriate approach for most obese patients. In one study, laparoscopic ventral hernia repair was associated with a decreased risk of surgical site infections, a shorter length of stay, and a comparable operative time compared with open repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In general, we encourage weight loss to bring the patient's body mass index (BMI) under 30 before proceeding with ventral hernia repair in obese patients. (See <a href=\"#H1374962812\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above.)</p><p>However, most would agree that laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is contraindicated in patients who have very large abdominal defects or loss of domain, skin graft coverage of an open abdomen, active enterocutaneous fistula, a contaminated operative field, or need to remove previously placed prosthetic mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Otherwise, the choice between laparoscopic and open repair is largely determined by surgeon expertise and preference. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349380045\"><span class=\"h2\">Large (width &gt;10 cm) or complex hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventral hernias with a defect width &gt;10 cm are classified as large hernias by the European Hernia Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Large hernias and complex hernias in which greater than one-half of the abdominal viscera lies outside of the boundary of the abdomen (loss of domain) are difficult to repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Although these hernias can be repaired using laparoscopic sublay, open inlay, or component separation techniques, there are very little high-quality data on the efficacy or effectiveness of each repair. For patients with large (sometimes called giant) ventral hernias and patients with loss of domain, we prefer using advanced techniques, such as component separation, to achieve primary fascial closure before mesh reinforcement as opposed to using mesh to bridge a fascial defect (inlay mesh method). </p><p>Pioneered by Ramirez [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], component separation is used nearly exclusively for the repair of large or complex midline abdominal wall defects and has the advantage of restoring abdominal wall function. Component separation involves dividing portions of the anterior or posterior rectus sheaths <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a lateral oblique muscle in a manner that allows advancement of the rectus abdominis muscle by as much as 10 cm from each side to allow a fascial closure under physiologic tension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59694\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59694 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>]. Component separation can be performed using an open or laparoscopic-assisted approach. Not all patients are candidates for a component separation technique. The indications, contraindications, and technical aspects of component separation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component separation repair of large or complex abdominal wall defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although mesh reinforcement can reduce the risk of hernia recurrence, it cannot restore dynamic abdominal wall function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/25,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,42</a>]. The component separation technique is an effective method for reconstructing the abdominal wall in a manner that restores innervated muscle function with physiologic tension, and it potentially can avoid complications associated with the use of mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Systematic reviews have not found any significant differences in recurrence rates for component separation compared with mesh techniques (particularly laparoscopic approaches) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/36,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,94</a>]. However, most experts recommend performing a component separation with mesh reinforcement because the recurrence rate remain high with suture repair alone after component separation. </p><p>Standard laparoscopic repairs use underlay mesh, and, although there are advantages of less pain, a shorter recovery, and a lower infection rate, the subsequent repair still lacks the dynamic effects of abdominal wall muscle, and patients will still notice a bulge (called eventration) at the site of the defect with increases in intra-abdominal pressure. The repair of large defects with mesh may not reduce the discomfort, back pain, and respiratory problems when compared with component separation, which restores the dynamic muscle component to the abdominal wall. </p><p>When confronted with an abdominal wall defect that is too large to close with component separation (and many are), mesh reinforcement can be used. As with standard mesh repair, either onlay or sublay placement may be used. No prospective studies are available to guide this choice, and, based upon retrospective reviews, there does not appear to be any significant difference in hernia recurrence rates. Our preference is for the sublay technique to minimize the risk of mesh infection, which, following repair of large midline defects, can be a serious complication. There is no consensus whether or how the mesh should be covered in this setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7499724\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the hernia has been repaired, standard closure of the subcutaneous tissue and skin is performed.

In general, meshes should be used to reinforce, rather than bridge, primary fascial closures (eg, inlay mesh repair). A meta-analysis of 16 studies showed that for laparoscopic repair, closure of the fascial defect was associated with a lower rate of seroma formation (2.5 versus 12.2 percent), fewer adverse events (4.9 versus 22.3 percent), and a shorter hospital stay, compared with not closing the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7499744\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of drains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of a drain is largely dependent upon surgeon preference.

A 2013 Cochrane database systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether wound drains after incisional hernia repair are associated with better or worse outcomes than no drains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. </p><p>For repair of large or complex abdominal wall defects, closed suction drains are often used to prevent fluid collections that can accumulate beneath the skin flaps and adjacent mesh. Because closed suction drainage is associated with an increased risk of surgical site or mesh infection, which can be a serious complication often requiring mesh removal, we avoid placing drains directly in contact with mesh and remove them promptly once they are no longer needed.

For large or complex ventral hernia, a study using component separation to repair ventral hernia in morbidly obese patients reported that major perioperative morbidity was 8 percent and perioperative mortality was 1.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of wound infection is approximately 5 percent for open repairs and may be slightly lower for laparoscopic repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Between 1.4 and 6.9 percent of meshes had to be removed because of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>]. Risk factors associated with mesh explantation include enterotomy or another abdominal procedure concomitant with the hernia repair, surgical site infection, and onlay position of mesh placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. In a large administrative database study of over 600,000 patients who underwent at least one ventral hernia repair, 0.07 percent had mesh removed after a median of 346 days after initial surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. The median cumulative cost for patients who required mesh explantation was substantially higher than for those who did not require mesh removal ($21,889 versus $6983).

Epigastric and umbilical hernias are primary ventral hernias. Incisional hernias can develop anywhere an incision has been made but most commonly at the midline, given that midline incisions are most commonly used during laparotomies. Spigelian and parastomal hernias occur off the midline. (See <a href=\"#H775465\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an acutely incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernia require emergency repair. We suggest an open, rather than laparoscopic, approach to emergency ventral hernia repairs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The objectives of an emergency surgery should be to alleviate any acute problems (eg, bowel infarction, bowel obstruction, abdominal pain) without jeopardizing the opportunity for a satisfactory hernia repair. (See <a href=\"#H3919807576\" class=\"local\">'Acutely incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernias'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic ventral hernias can be safely watched if patients wish to avoid surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H713315308\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic ventral hernias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical repair is indicated for patients with a symptomatic ventral hernia. However, patients who are smokers, super obese (with a body mass index &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> or have poorly controlled diabetes (with an HbA1c &gt;8 percent) should undergo preoperative optimization before they are offered an elective surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1948272770\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic ventral hernias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventral hernias can be repaired with sutures, mesh, or other complex techniques such as component separation depending on hernia size and surgeon expertise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114345\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114345 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H776002\" class=\"local\">'Ventral hernia repair'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small (&lt;1 cm) primary ventral (eg, umbilical, epigastric) hernias can be repaired with sutures with or without mesh reinforcement at the surgeon's discretion. Small (&lt;1 cm) incisional ventral (eg, trocar site) hernias imply poor healing and should be repaired with mesh reinforcement. (See <a href=\"#H774698\" class=\"local\">'Primary ventral hernia &lt;1 cm'</a> above and <a href=\"#H870642511\" class=\"local\">'Incisional ventral hernia &lt;1 cm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For ventral hernias between 1 and 10 cm, we recommend a mesh, rather than suture repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Simple suture repair of incisional and large primary ventral hernias is associated with a very high recurrence rate. (See <a href=\"#H779488\" class=\"local\">'Ventral hernias between 1 and 10 cm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For large (width &gt;10 cm) or complex hernias with which primary fascial closure is not possible, we suggest using an advanced technique (eg, component separation) to achieve fascial closure, rather than bridging the defect with an inlay mesh (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H349380045\" class=\"local\">'Large (width &gt;10 cm) or complex hernias'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hernia meshes can be placed above the fascia (onlay), below the rectus muscles (sublay), below the peritoneum (underlay or intraperitoneal onlay [IPOM]), or in between fascial edges (inlay). We suggest sublay mesh placement for open repair, and underlay mesh placement for laparoscopic repair, rather than onlay or inlay meshes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Sublay or underlay mesh repair has been associated with lower rates of both hernia recurrence and complications compared with onlay or inlay mesh repair. (See <a href=\"#H3234420596\" class=\"local\">'Mesh location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventral hernia repair with mesh can be accomplished open or laparoscopically. For experienced surgeons repairing ventral hernias between 2 and 10 cm in a clean field, we recommend a laparoscopic, rather than open approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The preponderance of data favor laparoscopic repair for its short-term benefits of lower incidences of surgical site and mesh infection, less pain, and faster recovery. For larger or more complex hernias, open repair with advanced techniques may be required because primary fascial closure is unlikely to be achieved laparoscopically. (See <a href=\"#H1679615691\" class=\"local\">'Open versus laparoscopic repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whenever possible, we suggest primary fascial closure for both open and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). It has been associated with fewer complications compared with not closing the fascial primarily. (See <a href=\"#H2464764187\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morbidity and mortality following repair of ventral hernia are overall low in appropriately selected patients. Recurrent hernia rates depend upon the size of the hernia and type of repair, ranging from 12 to 45 percent, with the lowest rates associated with mesh repairs and highest rates with simple suture repairs. Recurrence can be due to improperly positioned mesh or mesh that pulls away from the fascial edge but may also be due to an unrecognized hernia near the site of the repair. (See <a href=\"#H774740\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ventral-hernias/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bedewi MA, El-Sharkawy MS, Al Boukai AA, Al-Nakshabandi N.
