Additional signs and symptoms that can occur include visual disturbances, headache, epigastric pain, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver function. These clinical manifestations result from mild to severe microangiopathy of target organs, including the brain, liver, kidney, and placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Potential maternal sequelae include pulmonary edema, cerebral hemorrhage, hepatic failure, renal failure, and death. The <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> burden of disease results from placental hypoperfusion and the frequent need for preterm delivery.</p><p>The pathophysiology of preeclampsia likely involves both maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/placental</span> factors. Abnormalities in the development of placental vasculature early in pregnancy may result in relative placental <span class=\"nowrap\">underperfusion/hypoxia/ischemia,</span> which then leads to release of antiangiogenic factors into the maternal circulation that alter maternal systemic endothelial function and cause hypertension and other manifestations of the disease (hematologic, neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic dysfunction). However, the trigger for abnormal placental development and the subsequent cascade of events remains unknown. </p><p>Our current understanding of mechanisms causing the pathologic changes observed in preeclampsia will be reviewed here. The clinical features and management of preeclampsia, and treatment of hypertension during pregnancy are discussed separately.

It is clear that defects in spiral artery remodeling and trophoblast invasion, two related but separate processes, are characteristic of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These processes result in impaired placentation and placental ischemia, which are thought to be the primary events leading to placental release of soluble factors that cause systemic endothelial dysfunction resulting in the preeclamptic phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Systemic endothelial dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal remodeling of spiral arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal pregnancies, the cytotrophoblast cells of the developing placenta migrate through the decidua and part of the myometrium to invade both the endothelium and highly muscular tunica media of the maternal spiral arteries, the terminal branches of the uterine artery that supply blood to the developing <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/placenta</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57301 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, these vessels undergo transformation from small muscular arterioles to large capacitance vessels of low resistance, thus greatly facilitating blood flow to the placenta compared with other areas of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Remodeling of the spiral arteries probably begins in the late first trimester and is completed by 18 to 20 weeks of gestation, although the exact gestational age at which trophoblast invasion of these arteries ceases is unclear.</p><p>By comparison, in preeclampsia, cytotrophoblast cells infiltrate the decidual portion of the spiral arteries, but fail to penetrate the myometrial segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The spiral arteries fail to develop into large, tortuous vascular channels created by replacement of the musculoelastic wall with fibrinoid material; instead, the vessels remain narrow, resulting in placental hypoperfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61445\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61445 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89125 \">figure 3</a>). This defect in deep placentation has been associated with development of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes, including second trimester fetal death, placental infarcts, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia with or without intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine growth restriction without maternal hypertension, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>It is not known why the normal sequence of events in development of the uteroplacental circulation does not occur in some pregnancies. Vascular, environmental, immunological, and genetic factors all appear to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These factors will be reviewed in the following discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Defective trophoblast differentiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defective differentiation of trophoblast is one possible mechanism responsible for defective trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Trophoblast differentiation during endothelial invasion involves alteration in expression of a number of different classes of molecules, including cytokines, adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix molecules, metalloproteinases, and the class Ib major histocompatibility complex molecule, HLA-G [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. During normal differentiation, invading trophoblasts alter their adhesion molecule expression from those that are characteristic of epithelial cells (integrin <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha6/beta1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">alphav/beta5,</span> and E-cadherin) to those of endothelial cells (integrin <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha1/beta1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">alphav/beta3,</span> and VE-cadherin), a process referred to as pseudo-vasculogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Trophoblasts obtained from women with preeclampsia do not show upregulated adhesion molecule expression or pseudo-vasculogenesis. </p><p>Transcriptomics and culture studies using human trophoblasts from women with severe preeclampsia have suggested that semaphorin 3B may be a candidate protein that contributes to the impaired trophoblast differentiation and invasion by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A laser microdissection approach enabled the identification of novel messenger RNAs and non-coding RNAs that were differentially expressed by various trophoblast subpopulations in severe preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Gene ontology analysis of the syncytiotrophoblast data highlighted the dysregulation of immune functions, morphogenesis, transport, and responses to vascular endothelial growth factor and progesterone. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the specific pathways that are disrupted. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoperfusion, hypoxia, ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoperfusion appears to be both a cause and a consequence of abnormal placental development. A causal relationship between poor placental perfusion, abnormal placental development, and preeclampsia is supported by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal models that have successfully reproduced at least some of the findings of preeclampsia have involved mechanically reducing uteroplacental blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical conditions associated with vascular insufficiency (eg, hypertension, diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, renal disease, acquired and inherited thrombophilias) increase the risk of abnormal placentation and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetrical conditions that increase placental mass without correspondingly increasing placental blood flow (eg, hydatidiform mole, hydrops fetalis, diabetes mellitus, twin gestation) result in relative ischemia and are associated with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia is more common in women who live at high altitudes (&gt;3100 meters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p>Hypoperfusion is also a result of abnormal placental development. Hypoperfusion becomes more pronounced as pregnancy progresses since the abnormal uterine vasculature is unable to accommodate the normal rise in blood flow to the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/placenta</span> with increasing gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Late placental changes consistent with ischemia include atherosis (lipid-laden cells in the wall of the arteriole), fibrinoid necrosis, thrombosis, sclerotic narrowing of arterioles, and placental infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/7,22,23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22,23,25,26</a>]. Although all of these lesions are not uniformly found in patients with preeclampsia, there appears to be a correlation between the severity of the disease and the extent of the lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and ischemia is a critical component in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia because the hypoperfused, ischemic placenta elaborates a variety of factors into the maternal bloodstream that alter maternal endothelial cell function and lead to the characteristic systemic signs and symptoms of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/19,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Systemic endothelial dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOLOGIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The focus on immunologic factors as a possible contributor to abnormal placental development was based, in part, upon the observation that prior exposure to <span class=\"nowrap\">paternal/fetal</span> antigens appears to protect against preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-41</a>]. Nulliparous women and women who change partners between pregnancies, have long interpregnancy intervals, use barrier contraception, and conceive via intracytoplasmic sperm injection have less exposure to paternal antigens and higher risks of developing preeclampsia. In addition, a meta-analysis found that women who conceive through oocyte donation have a more than two-fold higher rate of preeclampsia than women who conceive via other assisted reproductive technology methods and a four-fold higher rate of preeclampsia than women who have a natural conception, which also supports the hypothesis that immunologic intolerance between the mother and fetus may play a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Immunologic abnormalities, similar to those observed in organ rejection graft versus host disease, have been observed in preeclamptic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells express an unusual combination of HLA class I antigens: HLA-C, HLA-E, and HLA-G. Natural killer (NK) cells that express a variety of receptors (CD94, KIR, and ILT) known to recognize class I molecules infiltrate the maternal decidua in close contact with the EVT cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Interaction between NK cells and EVT cells has been hypothesized to control placental implantation. In preeclampsia, conflict between maternal and paternal genes is believed to induce abnormal placental implantation through increased NK cell activity.</p><p>Placental bed biopsies from women with preeclampsia have revealed increased dendritic cell infiltration in preeclamptic decidual tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The dendritic cells are an important initiator of antigen-specific T-cell responses to transplantation antigens. It is possible that increased number of dendritic cells may result in alteration in presentation of maternal and fetal antigens at the decidual level, leading to either abnormal implantation or altered maternal immunologic response to fetal antigens.</p><p>However, definitive evidence for this theory is lacking. Genetic studies looking at polymorphisms in the killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) on maternal NK cells and the fetal HLA-C haplotype suggest that women with KIR&ndash;AA genotype and fetal HLA-C2 genotype were at greatly increased risk of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A systematic review found no clear evidence that one or several specific HLA alleles were involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The authors suggested that interaction between maternal, paternal, and fetal HLA types, rather than any individual genotype alone, was probably an important factor to consider when studying immunogenetic determinants of preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunology of the maternal-fetal interface&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another interesting finding is that patients with preeclampsia have increased levels of agonistic antibodies to the angiotensin AT-1 receptor. This antibody can mobilize intracellular free calcium and may account for increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 production and shallow trophoblast invasion seen in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. In addition, angiotensin AT-1 receptor antibody stimulates sFlt-1 secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. It is unclear if these alterations are pathogenic or epiphenomena.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO ANGIOTENSIN II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased sensitivity to angiotensin II has been described in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], and may be related to increased bradykinin (B2) receptor upregulation in preeclamptic patients. Upregulation leads to heterodimerization of B2 receptors with angiotensin II type I receptors (AT1), and this <span class=\"nowrap\">AT1/B2</span> heterodimer increases responsiveness to angiotensin II in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>As discussed above, patients with preeclampsia have increased levels of agonistic antibodies to the angiotensin AT-1 receptor. Angiotensin II is the endogenous ligand for the AT-1 receptor, thus increased activation of this receptor by auto-antibodies could induce the hypertension and vascular injury observed in preeclampsia. Studies in mice support this theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. </p><p>Other studies in mice suggest that endothelial dysfunction induced by circulating anti-angiogenic factors are sufficient to induce angiotensin II sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These studies have provided a strong biological rationale for studying compounds that improve endothelial health for the treatment of preeclampsia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most cases of preeclampsia are sporadic, genetic factors are thought to play a role in disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/58-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-67</a>]. A genetic predisposition to preeclampsia is suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primigravid women with a family history of preeclampsia (eg, affected mother or sister) have a two- to five-fold higher risk of the disease than primigravid women with no such history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/59,60,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60,67,68</a>]. The maternal contribution to development of preeclampsia can be partially explained by imprinted genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In a study of sisters with preeclampsia, it was demonstrated that the mother developed preeclampsia only when the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/placenta</span> inherited a maternal STOX1 missense mutation on 10q22; when the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/placenta</span> carried the imprinted paternal homolog, the preeclampsia phenotype was not expressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1457606458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of preeclampsia is increased more than seven-fold in women who have had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spouses of men who were the product of a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia are more likely to develop preeclampsia than spouses of men without this history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/61,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman who becomes pregnant by a man whose previous partner had preeclampsia is at higher risk of developing the disorder than if the pregnancy with the previous partner was normotensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p>Although a study of preeclampsia in twins failed to find a genetic link [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], the bulk of data suggests that both maternal and paternal contributions to fetal genes may have a role in defective placentation and subsequent preeclampsia. </p><p>The genes for sFlt-1 and Flt-1 are carried on chromosome 13. Fetuses with an extra copy of this chromosome (eg, trisomy 13) should produce more of these gene products than their normal counterparts. In fact, the incidence of preeclampsia in mothers who carry fetuses with trisomy 13 is greatly increased compared to all other trisomies or to control pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In addition, the ratio of circulating sFlt-1 to PlGF is significantly increased in these women, thus accounting for their increased risk of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>A different locus at 12q may be linked to HELLP syndrome, but not preeclampsia without HELLP syndrome, suggesting that genetic factors important in HELLP syndrome (H = hemolysis, EL = elevated liver function tests, LP = low platelets) may be distinct from those in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Alterations in long non-coding RNA at 12q23 have been implicated as one potential mechanism that may lead to HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. This long non-coding RNA regulates a large set of genes&nbsp;that may be important for extravillous trophoblast migration.</p><p>Several other candidate genes, such as the angiotensinogen gene variant (T235), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and genes causing thrombophilia, have been linked with preeclampsia, but large studies have not shown them to be important for susceptibility to the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Genome wide scanning of 343 Icelandic women with preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension revealed a significant maternal susceptibility for preeclampsia locus at 2p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] and a large GWAS from Australia demonstrated a modest association (OR approximately 1.5) between two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the beta inhibin gene on 2q14.2 and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Other potentially significant loci have been identified at 2p12, 2p25, and 9p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/64,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,76,77</a>].</p><p>A large genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a genetic risk variant with genome-wide significance, and provided convincing replication in an independent cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. This GWAS finding provides compelling evidence that alterations in chromosome 13 near the <em>FLT1</em> locus in the human fetal genome are causal in the development of preeclampsia. It is striking that this first well-powered unbiased GWAS hones in on the <em>FLT1 </em>genomic region, given the body of literature devoted to the role of the FLT1 pathway in preeclampsia pathogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'sFlt-1, VEGF, PlGF'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3360602991\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601772835\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various dietary and lifestyle factors have been associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia; however, causality has been difficult to prove. A possible role for low dietary intake of calcium as a risk factor for preeclampsia is suggested by epidemiologic studies linking low calcium intake with increased rates of preeclampsia and prevention of preeclampsia with calcium supplementation in high-risk women. The mechanism of this association is not clear but may involve either immunologic or vascular effects of calcium regulatory hormones that are altered in preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-prevention#H3331389734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Calcium supplementation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2659407524\"><span class=\"h2\">Body mass index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective study demonstrated a linear relationship between increasing body mass index and increasing risk of developing preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

It is likely that obesity increases susceptibility to preeclampsia by inducing chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which may synergize with placental angiogenic factors to induce the microangiopathic features of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the clinical features of preeclampsia can be explained as clinical responses to generalized endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].

A variety of proangiogenic (VEGF, PlGF) and antiangiogenic factors (sFlt-1) are elaborated by the developing placenta, and the balance among these factors is important for normal placental development. Increased production of antiangiogenic factors disturbs this balance and results in the systemic endothelial dysfunction characteristic of preeclampsia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">sFlt-1, VEGF, PlGF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soluble fms&ndash;like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1 or sVEGFR-1) is a naturally occurring, circulating antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54562\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54562 \">figure 4</a>). VEGF is an endothelial specific mitogen that has a key role in promoting angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. Its activities are mediated primarily by interaction with two high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 (VEGF receptor-1 or fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [Flt-1]) and VEGFR-2 (kinase-insert domain region <span class=\"nowrap\">[KDR]/Flk-1),</span> which are selectively expressed on the vascular endothelial cell surface. VEGFR-1 has two isoforms: a transmembranous isoform and a soluble isoform (sFlt-1 or sVEGFR-1). Placental growth factor (PlGF) is another member of the VEGF family that is made predominantly in the placenta. It also binds to the VEGFR-1 receptor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of angiogenesis inhibitors&quot;, section on 'Vascular endothelial growth factor'</a>.)</p><p>sFlt-1 antagonizes the proangiogenic biologic activity of circulating VEGF and PlGF by binding to them and preventing their interaction with their endogenous receptors. Increased placental expression and secretion of sFlt-1 appear to play a central role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, based on the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/98-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-107</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>sFlt-1 administered to pregnant rats induces albuminuria, hypertension, and the unique renal pathologic changes of glomerular endotheliosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78879%7ENEPH%2F59970%7ENEPH%2F68634\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78879 graphicRef59970 graphicRef68634 \">picture 1A-C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro, removal of sFlt-1 from supernatants of preeclamptic tissue culture restores endothelial function and angiogenesis to normal levels.

Studies using banked sera showed that preeclamptic women had decreases in PlGF and VEGF levels well before the onset of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/105,108-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,108-113</a>]. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A nested case-control study using banked sera to measure serum sFlt-1, as well as PlGF and VEGF, across gestation found that changes in sFlt-1 were predictive of the subsequent development of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. sFlt-1 levels increased during pregnancy in all women; however, compared to normotensive controls, women who went on to develop preeclampsia began this increase earlier in gestation (at 21 to 24 weeks versus 33 to 36 weeks) and reached higher levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74345\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74345 \">figure 5</a>). A significant difference in the serum sFlt-1 concentration between the two groups was apparent five weeks before the onset of clinical disease. PlGF and VEGF levels fell concurrently with the rise in sFlt-1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58442\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58442 \">figure 6</a>), which may have been related, in part, to binding by sFlt-1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another study, the concentration of sVEGFR-1 correlated with increasing severity of disease: sVEGFR-1 concentrations were higher in women with severe or early (&lt;34 weeks) preeclampsia than in those with mild or late preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Furthermore, women with preeclampsia had higher sVEGFR-1 levels than women who remained normotensive two to five weeks before onset of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in both sFlt1 and PlGF correlate with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/114-116\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-116</a>].</p><p/><p>In the aggregate, these observations suggest a major role for sFlt-1 and related angiogenic factors in the pathogenesis of at least some features of preeclampsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73060\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73060 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. However, the trigger for increased sFlt-1 production by the placenta is unknown. The most likely trigger is placental ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. In vitro, placental cytotrophoblasts possess a unique property to enhance sFlt-1 production when oxygen availability is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. The increased expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) in preeclamptic placentas is consistent with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. It is not known whether increased sFlt-1 secretion is responsible for the early placental developmental abnormalities characteristic of preeclampsia or a secondary response to placental ischemia caused by some other factor. Genetic factors may also play a role in excess production of sFlt-1 and placental size (eg, multiple gestation) may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. </p><p>Experimental studies in animals suggest that sFlt-1 leads to vascular oxidative stress and increased sensitivity to vasopressors such as angiotensin II. These data suggest that endothelial dysfunction secondary to abnormal anti-angiogenic state may be the primary event leading to vasopressor sensitivity and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. It is likely that secondary, counter-regulatory systems may also play a role. For example, the renal disorder associated with preeclampsia, glomerular endotheliosis, leads to modest reductions in GFR and renal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Alterations in the renin angiotensin system such as suppressed plasma renin activity in women with preeclampsia are consistent with sodium volume retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. This sequence of events, similar to that observed in nonpregnant patients with glomerulonephritis, may also contribute to maternal hypertension.</p><p>Clinical applications for these observations have not been established. Measurement of serum sFlt-1 is still investigational and its ability to predict development of preeclampsia needs to be determined in prospective, longitudinal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Measurement of sFlt-1:PlGF ratio in serum appears to be a useful test to rule out preeclampsia in women with suspected preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. A high plasma sFlt-1:PlGF may also identify women at risk of requiring delivery within two weeks because of severe preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. In the future, apheresis or drugs that reduce sFlt-1 levels or promote PlGF levels may be useful to prevent or treat preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/124-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">124-127</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Soluble endoglin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that synergistic factors elaborated by the placenta other than sFlt-1 also play a role in the pathogenesis of the generalized endothelial dysfunction noted in preeclampsia. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that the plasma concentration of sFlt-1 protein needed to produce the preeclampsia phenotype in rats was several fold higher than the levels typically seen in patients with preeclampsia, and no coagulation or liver function abnormalities were reported in the sFlt-1 treated animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Eng is a coreceptor for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and is highly expressed on cell membranes of vascular endothelium and syncytiotrophoblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. A novel placenta-derived soluble form of Eng, referred to as soluble endoglin (sEng), is an anti-angiogenic protein that appears to be another important mediator of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/54,128-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,128-130</a>].</p><p>Although the precise relationship of sEng to sFlt-1 is unknown, it appears that both sEng and sFlt-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of the maternal syndrome through separate mechanisms.

Placental DNA released into the maternal circulation could play a role in driving the systemic inflammatory response of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Placental hypoxia increases placental necrosis and apoptosis, which releases cell-free DNA into the maternal circulation. As early as 17 weeks of gestation, women who develop preeclampsia appear to have higher levels of trophoblast cell-free DNA compared with controls, with a sharp rise three weeks before clinical signs of preeclampsia become apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-pathogenesis/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].

In preeclampsia, the cytotrophoblast infiltrates the decidual portion of the spiral arteries, but fails to penetrate the myometrial portion. Thus, the large, tortuous vascular channels characteristic of the normal placenta do not develop; instead, the vessels remain narrow, resulting in hypoperfusion. Environmental, immunological, and genetic factors all appear to play a role in this process.
