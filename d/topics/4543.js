The cornea is the clear tissue that covers the colored part of your eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70420 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4976947\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a corneal abrasion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A corneal abrasion can happen when something scratches your eye or gets stuck under your eyelid. Common things that can scratch a person&rsquo;s eye include fingernails, animal paws, branches, or pieces of paper. Tiny pieces of rust, wood, glass, plastic, or other objects that get stuck under your eyelid can also cause a corneal abrasion.</p><p>You can also get a corneal abrasion from wearing contact lenses. This is more likely if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear contacts that don't fit well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear contacts longer than you should, such as overnight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't clean your contacts well</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4976962\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a corneal abrasion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of a corneal abrasion are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you have a speck of sand in your eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye pain that is so bad you cannot work, drive, or sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teary, watery eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurred vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being very uncomfortable looking at bright lights</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4976977\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think you have something in your eye, you can try to remove it. But be careful not to irritate your eye. You can also pull your upper eyelid over your lower eyelid to try to brush away the object, such as an eye lash. Do not rub or press on it. Blink a few times to see if you can remove anything that might be in your eye.</p><p>If that doesn't work, rinse your eye with water once or twice. But rinsing more than a few times can make the problem worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4976992\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have the symptoms above and your eye still hurts a lot after you've tried rinsing it.</p><p>While waiting to see the doctor, you might feel better if you sit quietly in a darkened room with your eyes closed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4977007\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a corneal abrasion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will do an eye exam. As part of the exam, the doctor will put a small drop of a special yellow dye in your eye. The dye will help the doctor see whether the cornea has been scratched. He or she will also flip up your upper eyelid to check if anything is stuck there.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4977022\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a corneal abrasion treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor can treat your corneal abrasion with eye ointments or drops. Some ointments and drops help prevent infections. Others help ease pain. The doctor might also give you pills to help with your pain.</p><p>If the scratch on your cornea is large, the doctor might tape a gauze patch over your eye. This helps keep your eye closed, which helps it feel better. You should not use a fabric patch (&quot;pirate's patch&quot;) in place of gauze because it will not keep your eye closed. Most corneal abrasions heal in a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4977037\"><span class=\"h1\">Can corneal abrasions be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To lower your chances of getting a corneal abrasion, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear safety goggles when you work with machines that cut wood, metal, or other materials</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid wearing your contact lenses longer than directed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your contact lenses fit well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your contact lenses clean</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4977052\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=black-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Black eye (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-eye-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chemical eye injury (The Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
