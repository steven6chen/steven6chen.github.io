Clinical symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea after ingestion of milk or milk-containing products. These symptoms have been attributed to lactose malabsorption, which results from low levels of small intestinal lactase, which may be due to mucosal injury or, much more commonly, reduced genetic expression of the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of lactose intolerance. Other causes of malabsorption are discussed in detail, separately.

However, the prevalence of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance is unclear due to methodological limitations of existing studies that have used varying definitions of lactose malabsorption and intolerance. Evaluation of epidemiological trends suggests that the prevalence of lactose intolerance varies across racial and ethnic groups, with the lowest prevalence in Europeans and European Americans and higher prevalence in African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Asian Americans, and Native Americans. In Africa, some ethnic groups have high rates of lactose intolerance (South Nigerian, Hausa, Bantu), while others have low rates (Hima, Tutsi, nomadic Fulani). The prevalence of lactose malabsorption and intolerance are low in children younger than six years and increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8136933\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactose intake varies with age. Among infants, carbohydrates (primarily lactose) account for 35 to 55 percent of daily calories ingested. Lactose intake falls as weaning foods are introduced and eventually approaches the level ingested by adults. Lactose digestion is the rate-limiting step in the overall process of its absorption. Lactose is hydrolyzed by intestinal lactase to glucose and galactose on the microvillus membrane of the intestinal adsorptive cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Uptake of these monosaccharides is accomplished by the sodium-dependent glucose carrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H118042888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Glucose-galactose malabsorption'</a>.)</p><p>Lactose that is not absorbed by the small bowel is passed rapidly into the colon. In individuals with low lactase activity, up to 75 percent of lactose passes unabsorbed through the small intestine toward the cecum and colon, depending on the ingested amount of lactose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the colon, lactose is converted to short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen gas by the intestinal bacteria, producing acetate, butyrate, and propionate. If sufficient lactose is malabsorbed, these fermentation products and unfermented lactose cause symptoms of lactose intolerance. Newborn colons and adults with low small intestinal lactase activity can adapt to persistent lactose ingestion through bacterial conversion of lactose to short-chain fatty acids that can be absorbed in the colon. This salvages approximately 50 g of malabsorbed lactose per day for energy utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fecal microbiota adapts to dietary lactose over time and contributes to a reduction in the incidence and severity of symptoms following a lactose load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF LACTOSE MALABSORPTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8136967\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary lactose malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of primary lactose malabsorption is acquired primary lactase deficiency (adult-type hypolactasia, lactase nonpersistence). Less common causes include congenital lactase deficiency and developmental lactase deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Acquired primary lactase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetically regulated reduction of lactase enzyme activity or lactase nonpersistence is determined by racial or ethnic factors and is the underlying mechanism of lactose malabsorption in healthy individuals. The majority of the world's populations develop low intestinal lactase levels at preschool age. This characteristic is most frequent in Asian and African populations; in contrast, the majority of Caucasians, particularly of northern European background, maintain elevated lactase activity into adulthood. Such persistent lactase activity has also been observed in multiple small populations throughout the world that historically domesticated cows or other milk providers and consumed milk products into adulthood. In some of these groups, there is evidence for convergent evolution of lactase persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Genetic analysis has established that lactase persistence in adulthood is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, but the molecular basis is incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DNA sequence of the coding region and the regulatory region of the lactase gene on 2q21 have been identified. However, it remains unclear whether these polymorphisms have a causal role in lactase gene expression or provide markers for an as yet unidentified regulatory element. Several haplotypes defined by such polymorphisms have been associated with persistence of elevated lactase expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In particular, presence of the T allele of the SNP located at -13.9 kb upstream of the lactase gene has been strongly correlated with lactase persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Several in vitro studies have suggested that this allele regulates levels of lactase mRNA and thus lactase persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. A CC genotype at -13910 <span class=\"nowrap\">C/T</span> polymorphism is associated with acquired primary lactase deficiency (adult-type hypolactasia), whereas TC and TT genotypes are linked with lactase persistence. The correlation of this SNP to lactase persistence seems to vary between different ethnic groups. In cohorts from northern and southern Europe, Canada, and India, the correlation to lactase <span class=\"nowrap\">persistence/nonpersistence</span> is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In ethnic heterogeneous populations, like in the United States or Israel, the correlation of the -13910 <span class=\"nowrap\">C/T</span> polymorphism to lactase persistence or nonpersistence is less evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In other populations, such as some African and sub-Saharan African populations, the -13910 <span class=\"nowrap\">C/T</span> polymorphism is not associated with lactase persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25,26</a>]. While assessment of the presence of the T allele at -13.9 kb is of diagnostic value for lactase persistence or nonpersistence in homogeneous genetic groups such as those of Northern European origin, it is not of value in African populations and is of limited value in the heterogeneous United States populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H346642689\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> below.)</p><p>Expression patterns in transgenic mice indicate that most of the regulatory elements required for cell-specific regulation of lactase are within the first two kb of 5' flanking sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The transcription factors Cdx2, HNF-1a, and GATA are critical regulators of lactase expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. All lactase genes examined so far, including the human gene, contain binding sites for these factors in the proximal promoter. In addition, human genetic analysis indicates that the developmental decline may be regulated by more distant elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Molecular studies have generally found a positive correlation between lactase levels and lactase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, whether lactase activity is high or low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. This indicates that molecular regulation of this enzyme is at the level of gene transcription. In some subjects, however, there is a dissociation between lactase mRNA and lactase activity, suggesting that posttranscriptional factors also contribute to the decline in lactase biosynthesis, perhaps due to a partial block in transport of the enzyme from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital lactase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital lactase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.

The largest number of reported cases worldwide has been described in the Finnish population. The disorder is characterized by the absence of lactase activity in the small intestine, with normal histologic findings and normal levels of other disaccharidases. Genetic analysis has demonstrated mutations in the coding region of the LCT gene in affected patients from Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415113837\"><span class=\"h3\">Developmental lactase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental lactose malabsorption results from low lactase levels and is a consequence of prematurity. Lactase activity in the fetus increases late in gestation; thus, premature infants born at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation have reduced lactase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. If these infants are otherwise healthy, their colons can salvage the unabsorbed carbohydrates, preventing malnutrition and diarrhea.

In addition, adolescents may have symptoms of vomiting. The abdominal pain may be cramping in nature and is often localized to the periumbilical area or lower quadrants. In children, the stools may be bulky, frothy, and watery. In adults, diarrhea is not a predominant symptom. Borborygmi may be audible on physical examination and to the patient. </p><p>However, there is considerable variability in symptoms among patients with lactose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Meals with higher osmolality and fat content slow gastric emptying and reduce the severity of lactose-induced symptoms. Individuals with more rapid transit of lactose to the cecum are generally more symptomatic. In addition, individuals vary in their sensitivity to the abdominal distension caused by gas or the influx of water into the lumen of the small intestine due to the presence of undigested lactose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. These interindividual differences in sensitivity are related to intestinal hypersensitivity to distension and are not related to the amount of malabsorbed lactose or the volume of gas produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, these findings are not specific for lactose malabsorption and also occur in other etiologies of carbohydrate induced diarrhea, like the short bowel syndrome, villous atrophy, or pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

In adults, diarrhea is a rare symptom. A presumptive diagnosis of lactose intolerance can be made in patients with mild symptoms that occur within a few hours after significant lactose ingestion (eg, &gt;2 servings of <span class=\"nowrap\">dairy/day</span> or &gt;1 serving in a single dose that is not associated with a meal) and resolve after five to seven days of avoidance of lactose-containing foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In clinical practice, a provocative test, which is an oral lactose load (50 grams in a glass of water), and monitoring of symptoms over four hours, may also hint to this diagnosis. A lactose hydrogen breath test with simultaneous symptom assessment confirms the diagnosis of lactose malabsorption (if the breath test is abnormal) and of intolerance (if symptoms develop) in patients who do not want to be on a lactose-restricted diet, especially if they have a low probability of being lactase nonpersistent based on ethnicity (eg, Caucasian). Patients with severe symptoms or symptoms that persist despite a lactose-restricted diet should also undergo an evaluation to rule out other causes. The evaluation of chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactose breath hydrogen test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The breath hydrogen test measures lactose malabsorption. It is simple to perform, noninvasive, and has a sensitivity and specificity that are superior to the absorption test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. The lactose breath hydrogen test has a sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The sensitivity is limited by the fact that a proportion of patients have a colonic bacterial flora that uses hydrogen to produce methane. Various prevalences of these &quot;hydrogen nonexcretors&quot; have been reported, with the highest numbers approximating 20 percent of the studied population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This gap can be partially closed by simultaneous measurement of serum glucose (ie, lactose tolerance test) or by simultaneous measurement of breath methane concentrations.</p><p>In children, oral lactose in the fasting state at a dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (maximum dose 25 g), and in adults 50 g of lactose are commonly used. Breath hydrogen is sampled at baseline and at 30-minute intervals after the ingestion of lactose for three hours. We assess symptoms simultaneously on a scale from 0 (no symptoms of bloating and abdominal pain) to 5 (most severe symptoms) and, in addition, ask for the presence of diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">(yes/no)</span>. The post-lactose and baseline values are compared. A rise in hydrogen concentration of 20 ppm over baseline is considered diagnostic of lactose malabsorption. An increase of symptoms of 2 over baseline is considered diagnostic for lactose intolerance. In most patients, the hydrogen and the symptom peak occurs at 90 to 120 minutes, and the test may be stopped if a diagnostic increase has been achieved. Cigarette smoking or physical exercise sufficient to produce hyperventilation can affect the accuracy of the test and should be avoided for two hours prior to testing. On the evening before testing, dietary fibers have to be avoided.</p><p>As mentioned above, if hydrogen measurement is not available, simple symptom assessment after an oral lactose load may be sufficient to detect lactose intolerance, which is the therapeutically relevant clinical entity.</p><p>False negative results can be seen after the recent use of antibiotics, in patients with lung disease, or in up to 20 percent of subjects who are nonhydrogen producers. False positive results may be seen with small bowel bacterial overgrowth; these patients usually have an early rise in breath hydrogen concentration (earlier than 60 minutes after ingestion of lactose).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346642747\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactose tolerance test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a test indicating lactose absorption through serum glucose measurements. This test requires repeated measurements of glucose in blood, and has largely been replaced by the lactose breath hydrogen test. Following oral administration of a 50 g test dose in adults (or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> in children), blood glucose levels are monitored at 0, 60, and 120 minutes. An increase in blood glucose by less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> plus the development of symptoms is diagnostic. False negative results may occur in patients with diabetes or bacterial overgrowth. Abnormal gastric emptying also can lead to spurious results; the blood glucose may be relatively higher with rapid emptying and depressed with delayed gastric emptying. In adults, the sensitivity of the lactose tolerance test is less than the hydrogen breath test; however, it fills part of the gap in the sensitivity of the breath test, which is due to hydrogen nonexcretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346642689\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests, aimed at the detection of lactase deficiency, while available, have limitations and are rarely performed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small bowel biopsy</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>A jejunal biopsy allows for an assessment of lactase enzyme activity.

In patients with secondary lactose malabsorption, successful treatment of the primary disorder can lead to restoration of lactase activity. However, lactose intolerance may persist for months after healing starts and lags behind the return of normal intestinal morphology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary lactose restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since intolerance is a dose-dependent phenomenon, patients usually respond to restriction of lactose without having to avoid lactose-containing products altogether. Some milk products have naturally occurring low lactose content, and there is an increasing availability of dairy products with reduced lactose content. Individuals with lactose intolerance may start with more severe dietary restriction and then work up to their individually tolerated limit of ingestion of lactose-containing food. Routine daily consumption of lactose-containing products may be better tolerated than intermittent consumption. By far the highest concentration of lactose per serving is present in milk and ice cream (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54826\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54826 \">table 2</a>), but the high fat content and attendant decrease in gastric emptying rate may allow ice cream ingestion without symptoms. Cheeses generally contain much lower quantities of lactose. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Enzyme replacement'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals with lactose malabsorption can tolerate dairy products in limited quantities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,45,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,45,56-58</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial included 30 subjects who reported severe lactose intolerance after ingestion of less than 240 mL (8 oz) of milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Participants were assigned to 240 mL of lactose-hydrolyzed milk containing 2 percent fat or 240 mL of milk containing 2 percent fat and sweetener aspartame (because lactose-hydrolyzed milk tastes sweeter than normal milk). In this study, there was no difference in symptoms between the two groups, suggesting that symptoms in some subjects with severe intolerance may mistakenly be attributed to lactose, and symptoms are likely to be negligible if lactose intake is limited to the equivalent of 240 mL of milk per day. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent report from the same group found that 240 mL of milk could be tolerated twice daily if given in widely divided doses with food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, one quart (946 mL) of milk (equivalent to 50 grams of lactose) usually induced symptoms in adults with malabsorption when administered as a single dose without meals. </p><p/><p>Lactose has also been historically used as an additive for pharmaceutical products. However, the content of lactose in tablets is so small that there is no reason to assume that this would result in symptoms. Lactose-containing medications should not be avoided. In a randomized, crossover, double-blind study that evaluated breath hydrogen production and symptoms in 77 lactose intolerant subjects after the ingestion of 400 mg of lactose or placebo, neither breath hydrogen levels nor symptoms were different when subjects ingested low-dose lactose or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Advertisements promoting &quot;lactose-free drugs&quot; therefore lack a scientific basis and may serve to promote misunderstanding about the relationship between lactose dose and generation of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzyme replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercially available lactase enzyme preparations are bacterial or yeast beta-galactosidases and are available as preparations that can be taken orally with lactose-containing food. Liquid lactase preparations can be added to milk (14 <span class=\"nowrap\">drops/quart),</span> which is then refrigerated overnight before use. The resulting hydrolysis of lactose produces a sweeter taste than milk containing lactose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Commercially available predigested dairy products are also available. Patients who have lactose intolerance should follow the instructions on the label and adjust both the dose and the lactose load to tolerance. </p><p>Lactase enzyme preparations can reduce symptoms and breath hydrogen values in many lactose intolerant subjects. However, these products are not capable of completely hydrolyzing all dietary lactose, and the results achieved in individual patients are variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy of three lactase preparations: Lactaid, Lactrase, and DairyEase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Only Lactaid reduced breath hydrogen after a lactose load; however, Lactaid did not improve symptoms. On the other hand, Lactrase, which did not reduce breath hydrogen, diminished pain, bloating, and total symptom scores, while Dairy Ease only improved pain. </p><p>Live culture yogurt, which contains endogenous beta-galactosidase, is an alternative source of calories and calcium and may be well tolerated by many lactose intolerant patients. However, yogurts that contain milk or milk products added back after fermentation may produce symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium and vitamin D intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary calcium intake should be evaluated, and patients with inadequate intake should be encouraged to increase their consumption of calcium-rich foods or consider using calcium supplementation. In infants and young children, liquid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> is readily tolerated and available. The recommended daily calcium intake for adolescents and young adults is 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

Dietary lactose is hydrolyzed by small intestinal lactase to glucose and galactose on the microvillus membrane of the intestinal adsorptive cells. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of lactase deficiency varies across racial and ethnic groups, with the lowest prevalence in Europeans and European Americans and higher prevalence in African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Asian Americans, and Native Americans. In Africans, the rate of lactase deficiency varies depending on the ethnic group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactose that is not absorbed by the small bowel is passed rapidly into the colon. In individuals with low lactase activity, lactose passes unabsorbed through the small intestine toward the cecum and colon. In the colon, lactose is converted by bacteria to hydrogen gas and short-chain fatty acids (acetate, butyrate, and propionate). If sufficient lactose is malabsorbed, these fermentation products and unfermented lactose cause symptoms of lactose intolerance. (See <a href=\"#H8136933\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of primary lactose malabsorption is lactase enzyme nonpersistence. Lactose malabsorption may be secondary to underlying intestinal diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71595 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of lactose malabsorption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactose malabsorption rates are low in children younger than six years and increase with age. (See <a href=\"#H8136927\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactose intolerance is a clinical syndrome in which lactose ingestion causes symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea) due to lactose malabsorption. (See <a href=\"#H8136961\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and in children, also diarrhea. In addition, adolescents may have symptoms of vomiting. Patients with diarrhea have a stool osmotic gap of &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> due to the presence of unabsorbed carbohydrates within the intestinal lumen and a stool pH &lt;6 due to bacterial fermentation of lactose in the colon. However, these findings are not specific for lactose malabsorption. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of lactose intolerance should be considered in patients with bloating, flatulence, and abdominal pain. A presumptive diagnosis of lactose intolerance can be made in otherwise healthy patients with mild symptoms that occur with significant lactose ingestion (&gt;2 servings of <span class=\"nowrap\">dairy/day</span> or &gt;1 serving in a single dose that is not associated with a meal) and resolve after five to seven days of avoidance of lactose-containing foods. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lactose hydrogen breath test with simultaneous assessment of symptoms can be used to confirm lactose malabsorption and intolerance in patients who have a low probability of being lactase nonpersistent based on ethnicity (eg, Caucasian). Patients with severe symptoms or symptoms that persist despite a lactose-restricted diet should also undergo an evaluation to rule out other causes. In patients with lactose intolerance, a secondary cause for lactose malabsorption should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H502431217\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to rule out a secondary cause'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be advised that complete elimination of dietary lactose is not required and that restriction of their intake of lactose to two cups of milk (or its lactose equivalent) daily, taken in divided doses with two meals, is often sufficient to treat symptoms of intolerance. Patients may use lactose-reduced products or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactase supplements</a>. Patients with inadequate dietary intake may require calcium supplementation. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in patients who avoid dairy intake.
