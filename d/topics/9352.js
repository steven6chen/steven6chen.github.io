It is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, especially in the developing world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Early use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is a way of limiting ongoing uterine blood loss while initiating other measures, and can be readily implemented by providers with minimal training. It can be a life-saving intervention, especially in low-resource settings where blood transfusion and surgical facilities may not be available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Multiple types of balloons catheters are available for uterine tamponade. It is prudent to include one of these devices in postpartum hemorrhage kits.</p><p>This topic will discuss the use of intrauterine balloon catheters in the management of postpartum hemorrhage. Detailed information on medical and surgical treatments for postpartum hemorrhage, as well as the causes, can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Management approaches requiring laparotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of balloon tamponade and other interventions for management of acute severe menorrhagia are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing an episode of severe or prolonged uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BALLOON CATHETERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following balloon catheters were specifically designed for placement in the uterus for control of postpartum hemorrhage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bakri tamponade balloon catheter </strong>&ndash; The Bakri tamponade balloon catheter is the first uterine tamponade balloon system designed specifically for the treatment of obstetric hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It consists of a silicone balloon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94340 \">picture 1</a>) (maximum recommended fill volume 500 mL, but volumes up to 1300 mL have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]) connected to a 24 French silicone catheter 54 cm in length. The collapsed balloon is inserted into the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60864 \">figure 1</a>); when filled with fluid, the balloon adapts to the configuration of the uterine cavity to tamponade uterine bleeding. The central lumen of the catheter allows drainage and is designed to monitor ongoing bleeding above the level of the balloon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52635 \">figure 2</a>). The device is intended for one-time use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>BT-Cath</strong> &ndash; The BT-Cath is a silicone balloon (maximum recommended fill volume 500 mL) with an inverted pear shape to conform to the shape of the uterine cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95201\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95201 \">picture 2</a>). In contrast to the Bakri tamponade balloon catheter, the balloon end of the catheter is flush with the end of the balloon. One lumen of the dual lumen catheter is used to infuse saline and expand the balloon, while the other lumen allows drainage of blood from the fundus. It is intended for one-time use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ebb Complete Tamponade system </strong>&ndash; The ebb Complete Tamponade System is a dual polyurethane balloon system containing an upper uterine balloon (maximum recommended fill volume 750 mL) and a lower vaginal balloon (maximum recommended fill volume 300 mL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94342 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94343 \">figure 3</a>). Each balloon is filled by attaching an intravenous fluid bag to the infusion port and manually filling the balloon by squeezing the intravenous bag that contains isotonic solution. Fluid is instilled in increments beginning at 250 mL, and the volume is increased gradually until tamponade is achieved. A central drain allows for monitoring of possible ongoing or recurrent hemorrhage from above the uterine balloon. The device is intended for one-time use. The manufacturer recalled this product because of a potential for a balloon leak in all lots of CTS-1000 manufactured since August 2014. It has been reintroduced for use after correction of the problem from January 2017.</p><p/><p>Other devices that have been used for uterine tamponade, but are not intended for this purpose, include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (used for treatment of bleeding esophageal varices)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single or multiple Foley catheters (used for bladder drainage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rusch urologic balloon (used for stretching the bladder)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condom catheter (a condom is placed over the end of a Foley-type catheter, the base of the condom is ligated to the catheter to prevent leakage, and then the condom is filled with up to 500 mL fluid via the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/2,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-10</a>])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size 8 surgical glove tied to an intravenous infusion or other catheter, and then filled with up to 500 mL fluid</p><p/><p>Rusch balloons, surgical glove, and condom catheters are made of latex rubber; the other devices are made of silicone or polyurethane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presumed mechanism of action of intrauterine balloon catheters is application of inward to outward hydrostatic pressure against the uterine wall; this pressure may or may not be in excess of systemic arterial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Compression of proximate blood vessels reduces blood flow and facilitates clotting. The net result is reduction in persistent capillary and venous bleeding from the endometrium, placental remnants, and myometrium.</p><p>In addition, an intrauterine balloon can be used in combination with a B-Lynch uterine compression suture to create a &quot;uterine sandwich,&quot; whereby the uterus is compressed between the balloon internally and the compression suture externally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'External compression plus internal tamponade'</a> below).</p><p>Other mechanisms may also be involved, and may vary according to the type of balloon catheter. As an example, decreased uterine artery blood flow after insertion of the balloon catheter has been observed on ultrasound and Doppler examination in patients with an ebb Complete Tamponade System balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine balloon tamponade is indicated when uterotonic drugs and bimanual compression of the uterus fail to control bleeding. Its use is indicated before resorting to more invasive surgical approaches requiring laparotomy. If bleeding persists, arrangements should be made for definitive treatment, which may include transferring the patient to another facility. Balloon tamponade is often successful, obviating the need for arterial embolization or an open surgical intervention.</p><p>Most cases where intrauterine balloon tamponade has been used successfully involved acute postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. Intrauterine balloon catheters have also been used with variable success to control or reduce bleeding after cesarean delivery with placenta previa, low lying placenta, or a focally invasive or adherent placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. A small number of cases of delayed (secondary) postpartum hemorrhage have been successfully managed with balloon catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-late-postpartum-hemorrhage#H1030069322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary (late) postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Definition/diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Intrauterine balloon catheters have also been successful in management of acute, recurrent uterine inversion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=puerperal-uterine-inversion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Puerperal uterine inversion&quot;</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] and prophylactically or as an adjuvant therapy to control bleeding in women with cesarean scar pregnancy or cervical pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-pregnancy-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-and-heterotopic-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal pregnancy, cesarean scar pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical pregnancy&quot;</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].&nbsp;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine balloon tamponade is contraindicated in postpartum patients allergic to any component of the device and in clinical settings where tamponade is unlikely to be effective (eg, bleeding from pelvic vessels or cervical or vaginal trauma; uterine abnormalities that prevent effective balloon tamponade; suspected uterine rupture; cervical cancer; and purulent infection of the vagina, cervix or uterus).</p><p>As with any emergent clinical situation, one must assess the risks and benefits to placement of the intrauterine balloon and proceed accordingly. These devices should not be used when a large amount of placenta is adherent to the uterus and immediate hysterectomy may be life-saving. They should not replace evacuation of retained products of conception or antibiotic treatment of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation for balloon placement should begin when postpartum hemorrhage is anticipated or encountered. The balloon should be inserted before coagulopathy develops since tamponade is less likely to be successful if clotting is impaired. However, it may be possible to correct coagulopathy concurrently with balloon insertion. Tranexamic is generally administered as an early intervention in management of postpartum hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management#H2022038691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;, section on 'Administer tranexamic acid'</a>.)</p><p>The insertion procedure involves the following general steps, which vary slightly depending on the specific device that is being used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">After vaginal delivery</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure that the bladder is empty by placing a bladder catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fill a sterile basin with the maximum volume of sterile fluid that can be instilled, but at least 500 mL. Alternatively, a 1 L crystalloid infusion system can be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleanse the cervix and vagina with an antiseptic solution, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a second visual inspection of the vagina and cervix to ensure the absence of bleeding lacerations as the source of the hemorrhage. Bleeding lacerations should be repaired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the placenta to ensure that it is complete. Perform a gentle digital examination of the uterine cavity to make sure it is empty. Ultrasound can also be used to evaluate for retained placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grasp the anterior lip of the cervix with ring forceps and apply gentle traction to align the direction of the cervical canal to that of the uterine cavity. Use long dressing forceps to insert the balloon catheter into the uterine cavity, above the level of the internal cervical os, as high in the uterine cavity as possible without exerting any force. Alternatively, the catheter can be inserted manually, similar to insertion of an intrauterine pressure catheter. At times, resistance is felt within the proximal part of the uterine cavity after negotiating the cervical canal. This is due to non-alignment of the direction of the cervical canal to that of the uterine cavity and can be managed by gentle pressure antero-posteriorly over the uterine fundus by a hand on the abdomen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrasound, if available, is useful to confirm correct placement in the uterine cavity (ie, exclude extrauterine placement as might occur with uterine rupture). On post-insertion ultrasound examination, the balloon may be in the lower segment and the upper segment may be well contracted with a thin endometrial shadow. Ultrasound examination is also useful to evaluate for significant residual placental tissue, which should be removed if present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Avoid excessive force when placing the device, as perforation of the uterus is theoretically possible. If resistance is encountered, catheter placement should be readjusted or the procedure abandoned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If an assistant is available, the assistant can perform real-time imaging to guide balloon placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once correct position is confirmed, inflate the balloon with warm sterile fluid (warmth promotes the clotting cascade) until slight resistance is encountered to further instillation (this usually occurs between 250 and 300 mL) and bleeding slows down or stops. The maximum recommended volume to be instilled depends on the specific device (eg, 500 mL for the Bakri tamponade balloon catheter and BT-Cath, 750 mL for the ebb Complete Tamponade System); however, larger volumes can be infused if needed to control hemorrhage (eg, Bakri tamponade balloon can hold 1300 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an assistant is available, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> can inflate the balloon while the operator holds the vaginal portion in position, which helps to keep the intrauterine portion from popping out. If the balloon herniates into or prolapses through the cervix, instilling an extra 50 to 100 mL of fluid helps retain it or a vaginal pack can be used to retain the balloon (if bleeding has stopped). The ebb Complete Tamponade System uses two balloons to reduce the risk of expulsion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94342 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94343 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">After cesarean delivery</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the end of the catheter through the open uterine incision, place the balloon in the uterine cavity, and pass the stem of the catheter through the cervix and then into the vagina. Ask an assistant to pull the end of the catheter out of the introitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the uterine incision, taking care not to puncture the balloon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the assistant to inflate the balloon with sterile fluid while the surgeon inspects the uterus from above.</p><p/><p>Alternatively, the uterus can be closed and an assistant can then insert the balloon catheter from below and inflate it while the surgeon watches from above. This eliminates the risk of accidental needle perforation during uterine closure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIPROCEDURE MONITORING AND CARE</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of the intrauterine balloon is assessed by the &quot;tamponade test,&quot; which rapidly identifies patients who will require a laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>]. After insertion and inflation of the intrauterine balloon, if bleeding promptly stops or is minimal then the test is positive (successful), the inflated balloon is left in place, and laparotomy can be avoided. Further management is as described below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A negative (unsuccessful) test is defined as bleeding not controlled with inflation of the balloon. Patients with a negative test should proceed to laparotomy and, possibly, compression sutures, vascular ligation, or hysterectomy depending on the extent of blood loss, continuation of bleeding, and general condition of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Arterial embolization by an interventional radiologist is an option in patients who are hemodynamically stable and when personnel and facilities are readily available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management#H1301497499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;, section on 'Consider uterine or hypogastric artery embolization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest administering broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis while the balloon is in place. Although the effectiveness of antibiotics in this setting has not been studied, cervicovaginal bacteria can enter the uterus with introduction of the balloon catheter, the surface of the catheter is a potential site for microbial adherence and retention, and the endometrium is a good target for infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most clinicians continue use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> infusion for six to eight hours to prevent uterine atony [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other uterotonics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylergonovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylergonovine</a>, prostaglandins) may be used instead of, or in addition to, oxytocin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management#H1819760813\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;, section on 'Administer additional uterotonic drugs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In initial trials, a weight was placed at the end of the catheter and a sterile gauze pack soaked in iodine was placed in the vagina to provide additional compression of the lower uterine segment, although these approaches have been abandoned by some clinicians without loss of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Alternatively, the end of the catheter can be taped to the patient's thigh with or without slight tension, which is our practice. The relatively small number of cases in the literature precludes making any strong recommendations for or against any of these measures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the device has a drainage port, periodically flush the drainage port with sterile saline to ensure that it has not become occluded by blood and to remove clots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pen mark is placed on the abdomen at the level of the uterine fundus. Any increase in uterine size above this mark along with changes in pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and urine output despite no overt vaginal bleeding suggests that blood is accumulating within the uterine cavity above the balloon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the balloon becomes partially or completely dislodged, it can be deflated, repositioned, and reinflated. In patients with a positive tamponade test (ie, no bleeding), a vaginal pack can be used to keep the balloon from sliding out because of uterine contractions and the dilated postpartum cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor for signs and symptoms of ongoing blood loss, such as pallor, dizziness, hypotension, tachycardia, confusion, uterine enlargement, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and oliguria. Blood transfusion(s) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood products should be given, as needed, to correct prior deficits. Obstetrical providers should be prepared to intervene surgically if the patient's hemodynamic status worsens or does not immediately improve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The balloon catheter can be removed after two hours if hemostasis has been achieved, the patient&rsquo;s vital signs are normal and stable, and any coagulopathy is corrected. We leave the balloon in the uterus for up to 24 hours, but balloons have been left in place for as long as 82 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Manufacturers' package inserts state that the in-dwelling time should be 24 hours or less due to concerns about infection and tissue necrosis, but this time interval was not based on any data. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To remove the balloon, it is deflated, either all at once (our usual practice) or gradually over several hours, while monitoring the patient for recurrent bleeding. Emergency surgical services and experienced staff should be readily available when the balloon is deflated in case of recurrent hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The deflated balloon can be left in situ for 30 minutes to observe for any bleeding and withdrawn once the absence of bleeding is confirmed. We do not reinflate or reinsert a balloon if bleeding recurs during deflation or after removal. We consider persistent or recurrent bleeding as an indication to proceed with other treatment options. However the balloon can be re-inflated as a temporary measure until the time of the more definitive procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine balloon tamponade may be painful; it is important to provide adequate analgesia. Although partially deflating the balloon might alleviate pain, it would also reduce tamponade, possibly resulting in hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUCCESS RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical trials evaluating the use of these devices or comparing their effectiveness in an adequate manner. In case series, success rates of uterine balloon catheters for controlling hemorrhage range from 20 to 65 percent after cesarean delivery and 90 to 100 percent after vaginal delivery, and may depend on the type of device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/17-19,24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19,24-30</a>]. Even if balloon tamponade fails, it may reduce bleeding and provide time to prepare for other interventions or transportation from a local hospital to a tertiary center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the high success rate has resulted in less need for more invasive procedures. As an example, a study that compared rates of arterial embolization in the authors&rsquo; hospital in the periods before and after introduction of a balloon tamponade protocol observed a 75 percent reduction in use of embolization after initiating this protocol as the second-line approach to treatment for severe postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A post-marketing surveillance study on the use of the ebb Complete Tamponade System reported that in 98 percent of cases vaginal bleeding either decreased (43 percent) or stopped (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Few studies have evaluated success according to etiology of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/19,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31</a>].

A systematic review of observational studies of uterine balloon tamponade, uterine compression sutures, pelvic devascularization, and arterial embolization concluded there was no high quality evidence that any one method of management of severe postpartum hemorrhage was better than another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The cumulative success rates were 90.7 percent for arterial embolization, 84.0 percent for balloon tamponade, 91.7 percent for uterine compression sutures, and 84.6 percent for internal iliac artery ligation or uterine devascularization.&nbsp;As balloon tamponade is the most rapid, least invasive, and least costly of these approaches, we suggest performing this procedure if uterotonic therapy fails and before resorting to more invasive approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among methods for uterine tamponade, packing the uterus with gauze or other material has long been employed to control postpartum hemorrhage and has met with variable levels of success.

The overall success rate was 90 percent, and was 100 percent in patients with atony. There was no difference in success rates between the two devices, but use of an obstetrical balloon catheter is still preferable to the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetrical balloon catheters are made of silicone or polyurethane, which is advantageous in patients with latex allergy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their shape more naturally conforms to the uterine cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of uterine perforation may be less</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They come presterilized and ready to use, whereas the tip of the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube needs to be cut</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube has extra ports and is more complicated to use</p><p/><p>Foley balloon catheters are typically too small to significantly compress the inner uterus after delivery of a term or near term baby so multiple balloon catheters may need to be used.</p><p>The Rusch balloon catheter has sufficient volume to adequately compress the inner uterus, but does not have a drainage channel to monitor ongoing bleeding after placement. A study including 22 patients with ongoing severe postpartum hemorrhage despite medical management reported placement of the Rusch balloon catheter controlled bleeding in 13 patients (59 percent), but was unsuccessful and hysterectomy was required in 7 patients (32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The condom catheter is similarly limited by the absence of a channel for drainage and the need for some preparation (tying the condom around the catheter) prior to insertion. Having stated these, there is no evidence to suggest that a drainage port is essential for drainage of blood and in a review of the use of balloons 90 percent success has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications include perforation of the uterus during placement or inflation and cervical trauma due to inflation at an incorrect location; however, these complications have not been reported in the postpartum uterus.

One small study employed the sandwich technique post cesarean delivery in patients with persistent bleeding from uterine atony refractory to both medical therapy and a B-lynch suture. In this series of 24 cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage, 12 patients were successfully treated with the balloon catheter alone and 6 were successfully treated with the balloon catheter and the B-lynch suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The uterine compression suture will make it difficult to insert the balloon catheter but does not prevent inflation of the balloon. Using a simple vertical compression suture such as the Hayman suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59142 \">figure 5</a>) on either side of the uterus rather than a B-Lynch suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71907 \">figure 4</a>) facilitates subsequent insertion of a balloon catheter.</p><p>After placement of the deflated balloon catheter and careful closure of the hysterotomy (to avoid needling the catheter), the balloon is inflated with fluid (median 100 mL, range 60 to 250 mL). It is important to observe the myometrium and stop instilling fluid before undue blanching occurs at the compression suture sites, which might lead to rupture or uterine necrosis. It is also important to observe the vagina to determine when excessive bleeding has ceased. Procedure-related complications of uterine compression sutures, such as ischemic necrosis, erosion, pyometra, adhesions, and peritonitis, have been reported, but are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/39-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-46</a>].</p><p>If a balloon catheter is in utero before performing the uterine compression stitch, it should be removed or deflated while the compression stitch is carefully placed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Looped uterine sutures plus balloon tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One author (YB) has developed a technique using both an intrauterine balloon catheter and bilateral looped uterine vessel sutures (B-LUVS) for managing cases of bleeding from uterine atony. Initial results have been promising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of this technique is ongoing. </p><p>A curved, blunt edge 65 mm needle and a looped #1 monofilament absorbable or chromic gut suture is used to perform a continuous whip stitch through the full thickness of the lateral uterine wall (ie, serosa, myometrium, endometrium) on each side of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64192 \">figure 6</a>). Use of a looped suture adds strength and avoids the need for a knot where the stitch is begun. The stepwise stitches begin at the lowest possible location of the lower uterine segment and continue up to the cornual end if needed, while avoiding important adjacent structures: bladder, ureter, and fallopian tube. At the cornua, the loop is cut at one end, another stitch is taken, and the two ends of the suture are used to tie a knot.</p><p>After completing these sutures, the balloon catheter is inserted into the uterine cavity either transcervically or through the hysterotomy incision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum hemorrhage is an obstetrical emergency that is managed in a step-wise approach. After exclusion of retained products of conception and genital tract trauma, treatment of uterine atony is initiated, progressing from less invasive therapies (uterine massage, uterotonic drugs) to more invasive therapies (intrauterine balloon tamponade, arterial embolization, uterine compression sutures, uterine artery ligation) and ultimately hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After bleeding from vaginal and cervical lacerations and retained products of conception have been excluded, we recommend intrauterine balloon tamponade for management of acute postpartum hemorrhage refractory to medical and other conservative interventions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The balloon should be inserted before coagulopathy develops since tamponade is less likely to be successful if clotting is impaired. Balloon tamponade is as effective, but more rapid, less invasive, and less costly than arterial embolization and open surgical approaches for control of hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Success rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In case series, success rates of uterine balloon catheters for controlling hemorrhage range from 57 percent after cesarean delivery to 100 percent after vaginal delivery, and may depend on the type of device. It is most successful for management of uterine atony, but can also stop or reduce bleeding from other causes. If bleeding does not stop, intrauterine balloon tamponade often reduces bleeding and can be used as a temporizing measure while the patient is waiting for arterial embolization or open surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Success rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of balloon tamponade is assessed by the &quot;tamponade test,&quot; which rapidly identifies patients who will require a laparotomy. Patients with a negative test (ie, bleeding is not controlled with inflation of the balloon) should proceed to laparotomy and, possibly, hysterectomy. Arterial embolization by an interventional radiologist is an option for patients who are hemodynamically stable and when personnel and facilities are readily available. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Periprocedure monitoring and care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, the balloon is kept in the uterus for 2 to 24 hours. This period varies depending on individual case assessment (total blood loss and need for blood, blood product or fluid replacement, vital signs, threat of continued bleeding, availability of blood and personnel if rebleeding occurs). The balloon is then deflated, either all at once or gradually over several hours, while monitoring the patient for recurrent bleeding. Emergency surgical services and experienced staff should be readily available when the balloon is deflated in case of recurrent hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Periprocedure monitoring and care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balloon tamponade has been combined with other measures, such as the B-Lynch suture, but data on safety and efficacy are limited.
