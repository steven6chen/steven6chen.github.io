These limits are chosen to be 2 to 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean age of onset of puberty. In most populations, attainment of pubertal milestones approximates a normal distribution, with a mean age of onset of puberty of about 10.5 years in girls and 11.5 years in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047%7EPEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 graphicRef72046 \">figure 1A-B</a>) and an SD of approximately one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is biologically active in utero and briefly during the first week of life. It then becomes more active again during infancy, with peak activity between one and three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This state yields sex steroid levels comparable with those seen in early-to-mid puberty, but without peripheral effects. In boys, gonadotropin concentrations then decrease to prepubertal levels by six to nine months of age. In girls, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels decrease at approximately the same time as in boys, but the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations can remain elevated into the second year of life. This hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal activity during infancy is known as the &quot;mini puberty of infancy&quot;; its biological relevance is unknown.</p><p>The neonatal stage is followed by a long period of pre-puberty, which is a state of active suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Puberty occurs when there is reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The physiologic and genetic mechanisms that affect timing of pubertal maturation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Sequence of pubertal maturation'</a>.)</p><p>In 1969 and 1970, Marshall and Tanner defined the standards of normal pubertal development in children and adolescents, known as sexual maturity ratings or &quot;Tanner stages&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038%7EPEDS%2F80005%7EPEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 graphicRef80005 graphicRef79782 \">picture 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These studies reported that the first sign of puberty in English girls was breast development at an average age of 11 years (thelarche), followed by pubic hair growth (pubarche), and then menarche. In English boys, the first sign was testicular enlargement at an average age of 11.5 years followed by penile growth and pubic hair growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since these reports by Marshall and Tanner, several studies in the United States and other countries suggest that children, especially overweight children, are entering puberty at a younger age than previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/4-9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9,11</a>]. In addition, there are racial differences, with puberty occurring earlier in African-American children compared with non-Hispanic Caucasian and Hispanic children. These data and the proposed explanations for the trends are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H334357397\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Trends in pubertal timing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266911454\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using the traditional definition of precocious puberty as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before age eight in girls and nine in boys (2 to 2.5 standard deviations [SD] below the average age of pubertal onset in healthy children), one would expect that the prevalence rate should be around 2 percent, or 2 in every 100 children. However, population studies looking at the prevalence rates of precocious puberty yield markedly different rates depending on the population studied:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based United States study, breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pubic hair development was present at age eight in 48 percent of African-American girls and 15 percent of White girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At seven years of age, the proportions were 27 percent and 7 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study of data from Danish national registries from 1993 to 2001, the incidence of precocious puberty was 20 per 10,000 girls and less than 5 per 10,000 boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The diagnostic age limit utilized in this study was eight years for girls and nine for boys. About half the patients had central precocious puberty (CPP) and the remainder were isolated premature thelarche or adrenarche, or early normal pubertal development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=premature-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Premature adrenarche&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These observations suggest that the definition of precocious puberty is problematic, at least in girls, and that selection of children for evaluation should not only depend on age but also clinical features, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H266911694\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Threshold for evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is a strong female predominance of children with precocious puberty. In a retrospective review of 104 consecutive children referred for evaluation of precocious puberty, 87 percent were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THRESHOLD FOR EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest careful evaluation of children presenting with signs of secondary sexual development younger than the age of eight years in girls or nine years in boys. The level of concern and extent of evaluation should increase with younger age at presentation. Given the trend towards earlier pubertal development, in girls who are between the ages of seven and eight, a comprehensive history and physical examination and clinical follow-up may be sufficient if the clinical evaluation does not raise any additional concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H266911454\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.) &#160; </p><p>A more controversial approach was suggested in 1999 by the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (LWPES), which recommended that evaluation for a pathologic cause of precocious puberty be reserved for Caucasian girls who have breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pubic hair development before seven years of age and for African-American girls who have these findings before six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This recommendation was based on a study describing the first signs of pubertal development among approximately 18,000 girls in the United States and Puerto Rico, among whom development occurred at a younger age than had been previously reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72226 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The study did not distinguish between girls with isolated thelarche or adrenarche from those with true precocious puberty. This same study reported an average age at menarche of approximately 12.5 years, which was not substantially earlier than had been reported in the 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>This LWPES recommendation is controversial because of concerns that lowering the age threshold for evaluation of precocious puberty will result in failure to identify some children with pathologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As an example, a retrospective review of 223 girls referred to a tertiary center for evaluation of pubertal development before eight years of age found that utilization of the LWPES guidelines would have resulted in failure to identify a substantial number of patients with treatable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

CPP is characterized by sequential maturation of breasts and pubic hair in girls, and of testicular and penile enlargement and pubic hair in boys. In these patients, the sexual characteristics are appropriate for the child's gender (isosexual). CPP is pathologic in up to 40 to 75 percent of cases in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], compared with 10 to 20 percent in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52565 \">table 1</a>) &#160; (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Causes of central precocious puberty (CPP)'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral precocity</strong> &ndash; Peripheral precocity (also known as peripheral precocious puberty, gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty) is caused by excess secretion of sex hormones (estrogens or androgens) from the gonads or adrenal glands, exogenous sources of sex steroids, or ectopic production of gonadotropin from a germ cell tumor (eg, human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59268 \">table 2</a>). The term precocity is used instead of puberty here because true puberty requires activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, as occurs in CPP. Peripheral precocity may be appropriate for the child's gender (isosexual) or inappropriate, with virilization of girls and feminization of boys (contrasexual).

In children with non-progressive precocious puberty, treatment with a GnRHa is not needed because their adult height is not affected (ie, their final height untreated is concordant with their midparental height) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Guiding principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation for precocious puberty focuses on answering the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Who should be evaluated?</strong> &ndash; Evaluation is warranted in children presenting with signs of secondary sexual development younger than the age of eight (girls) or nine (boys) years.

In girls who are between the ages of seven and eight, a comprehensive history and physical examination may be sufficient if this examination does not raise any additional concerns. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is the cause of precocity central or peripheral?</strong> &ndash; The sequence of pubertal development in children with central precocious puberty (CPP) recapitulates normal pubertal development but at an earlier age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047%7EPEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 graphicRef72046 \">figure 1A-B</a>). By contrast, individuals with peripheral precocity have a peripheral source of gonadal hormones and are more likely to display deviations from the normal sequence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pace of puberty.

The possibility of exposure to exogenous sex steroids (medicinal or cosmetic sources) or compounds with sex-steroid-like properties should always be explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> &ndash; This includes height, weight, and height velocity <span class=\"nowrap\">(cm/year)</span>.

This means staging breast development in girls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 1A</a>), genital development in boys, and pubic hair development in both sexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005%7EPEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 graphicRef79782 \">picture 1B-C</a>). In girls, the diameter of glandular breast tissue (by direct palpation including compression to differentiate from adipose tissue when warranted) and the nipple-areolar complex should be assessed.

Penile size (stretched length of the non-erect penis, measuring from the pubic bone to tip of glans, excluding the foreskin) is rarely used for monitoring of pubertal progress because penile growth is not an early event in puberty, accurate measurement is difficult and may be awkward for the adolescent boy, and the &quot;pubertal threshold&quot; for penile-stretched length is not as clear as it is for testicular volume. Accurate measurements of testicular volume are critical to determine whether further radiologic or laboratory testing is necessary.

However, in patients presenting with typical features indicative of either isolated premature thelarche or adrenarche, a bone age may not be necessary, as initial close clinical observation for pubertal progression is likely sufficient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A significant advance in the bone age (greater than approximately 2 standard deviations [SD] beyond chronological age) is more likely to be indicative of either CPP or peripheral precocity, rather than a benign pubertal variant. A significantly advanced bone age does not, however, exclude a diagnosis of a benign pubertal variant. As an example, up to 30 percent of children with benign premature adrenarche have bone ages more than two years in advance of their chronological age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

Additional clinical characteristics such as lack of progression in secondary sexual characteristics or low <span class=\"nowrap\">LH/FSH</span> ratio post-gonadotropin stimulation test can help to differentiate these children from those with progressive CPP.

(See <a href=\"#H266911694\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the trend of earlier pubertal development, there is controversy about the lower age limit for normal pubertal development. Nonetheless, we recommend evaluation in children presenting with secondary sexual development younger than eight years in girls or nine years in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72226 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H266911694\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of precocious puberty is classified by the underlying pathogenesis into three categories (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central precocious puberty (CPP) is caused by an early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. CPP is pathologic in up to 40 to 75 percent of boys and 10 to 20 percent of girls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52565 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Causes of central precocious puberty (CPP)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peripheral precocity is caused by secretion of sex hormones either from the gonads or adrenal glands, ectopic human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production by a germ cell tumor, or by exogenous sources of sex steroids, and is independent from the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59268 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Causes of peripheral precocity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Benign pubertal variants include isolated breast development (premature thelarche), isolated pubic hair development (premature <span class=\"nowrap\">pubarche/adrenarche),</span> benign pre-pubertal vaginal bleeding, and non-progressive precocious puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72054 \">table 3</a>). These patterns are usually a variant of normal puberty and require no intervention. If the finding is isolated breast development or isolated pubarche, and there is no evidence of pubertal progression or accelerated growth, laboratory evaluation may not be necessary. However, close follow-up is recommended because some of these patients will turn out to have progressive precocity. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Types of benign or non-progressive pubertal variants'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in the laboratory evaluation of progressive development of precocious secondary sexual characteristics is to measure basal luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and either estradiol or testosterone concentrations. The results are used to differentiate between CPP and peripheral precocity, which then guides additional testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104041\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104041 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72017 \">table 4</a>). A good initial screening test to distinguish CPP from benign pubertal variants is measurement of a basal LH concentration (see <a href=\"#H323253704\" class=\"local\">'Basal serum LH'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In CPP, basal LH levels are often elevated into the pubertal range (greater than 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/L,</span> depending on the assay).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>LH concentrations in the prepubertal range (ie, &lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/L)</span> are consistent with either peripheral precocity or a benign pubertal variant such as premature thelarche. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the clinical picture is discordant with the initial baseline investigations (ie, ongoing pubertal progression with basal LH level &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/L),</span> a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test can be performed to help distinguish CPP from a benign pubertal variant. Children with CPP have a pubertal (heightened) LH response to GnRH stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72017 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H59458426\" class=\"local\">'Serum LH concentrations after GnRH agonist stimulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations for imaging depends on the type of precocious puberty (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All boys with CPP should have brain imaging because of the high prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) lesions in this group. While all girls with onset of CPP below the age of six years should also have a contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is ongoing controversy about the need for more routine imaging of girls between the ages of six and eight years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Boys with peripheral precocity may warrant an ultrasound examination of the testes to evaluate for the possibility of a Leydig-cell tumor. Girls with peripheral precocity may warrant a pelvic ultrasound performed to help identify the presence of an ovarian cyst or tumor. In both sexes, ultrasound of the adrenal glands may be indicated if adrenal pathology is suspected, and should be performed if there is suspicion for an adrenal tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other than a bone age, no further imaging is usually required for children with benign or non-progressive pubertal variants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323258369\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Paul Saenger, MD, MACE, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Boepple PA, Crowley WF Jr. Precocious puberty.
