GCA is also a classic systemic rheumatic disease of older adults; it virtually never occurs in individuals younger than 50 years of age and peaks in incidence in the seventh decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although all ethnic groups can be affected, most patients with GCA are white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many of the symptoms and signs of GCA result from involvement of the cranial branches of arteries that originate from the aortic arch, but, as the disease is systemic, vascular involvement can be widespread.</p><p>The diagnosis of GCA will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SUSPICION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) should be considered in a patient over the age of 50 years who complains of or is found to have one of the following symptoms or signs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abrupt onset of visual disturbances, especially transient monocular visual loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw claudication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained fever, anemia, or other constitutional symptoms and signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high serum C-reactive protein (CRP)</p><p/><p>A current or prior diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) heightens the potential diagnostic significance of any of these findings.</p><p>The manifestations of GCA are protean, are variable from patient to patient, and can be transient or fluctuating. Accordingly, if the disease is suspected, both current and recent symptoms compatible with GCA should be sought. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the association between the two diseases, a diagnosis of GCA should be considered in all patients with PMR. In patients who manifest only symptoms of PMR without symptoms and signs of cranial or large vessel disease, temporal artery biopsy and large vessel imaging are not required. Nevertheless, such patients should be questioned carefully about headache, jaw or arm claudication, visual symptoms, and unusual pain in the face, throat, or tongue, any of which could suggest the possibility of GCA. A careful clinical evaluation of large vessels for the presence of bruits and stenosis with bilateral blood pressure measurements is an essential part of the assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica#H690915865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;, section on 'Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell (temporal) arteritis'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of clinical manifestations unusual in GCA should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses (eg, lymphoma or other malignancy; other vasculitides, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis; atherosclerosis).

The treatment of GCA with high-dose glucocorticoids can be associated with considerable potential toxicities. The commitment of an older adult to this therapy should be founded, whenever possible, on unequivocal confirmation of the diagnosis.</p><p>The diagnosis of GCA is based on histopathology or imaging exams. Histopathologic evidence of GCA is most often acquired by temporal artery biopsy. It may be possible for color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS), as performed by experienced operators, to substitute for temporal artery biopsy as a diagnostic procedure in the appropriate clinical setting. (See <a href=\"#H1093208711\" class=\"local\">'Temporal artery biopsy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3542218838\" class=\"local\">'Color Doppler ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Though the most common presentation of GCA involves the cranial arteries, in some patients a different disease phenotype predominates in which the arteritis targets the large vessels. In these cases, imaging is essential for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1756318360\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a nondiagnostic initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3052802518\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory data can aid in the evaluation of GCA and its differential diagnosis but are not specific and cannot be relied on as definitive evidence for or against a possible diagnosis of GCA.</p><p>Although traditionally the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein (CRP) are high in GCA, the range of values for both tests is broad and nonspecific. The ESR can be increased by hyperglobulinemia and paraproteinemia, and both ESR and CRP can be markedly elevated in the face of malignancy and infection. Conversely, lower values do not exclude a possible diagnosis of GCA. In a study of 167 patients of biopsy-proved GCA, the ESR was less than 50 in 11 percent and less than 40 in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;, section on 'ESR and C-reactive protein'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1835490438\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of the temporal artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A temporal artery biopsy should be performed in all patients suspected of GCA. A potential exception to this diagnostic axiom has emerged from the use of CDUS as a surrogate diagnostic tool. (See <a href=\"#H3542218838\" class=\"local\">'Color Doppler ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1093208711\"><span class=\"h3\">Temporal artery biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, we recommend an initial unilateral temporal artery biopsy with an in vivo length of at least 1 to 2 cm. The diagnostic sensitivity of a unilateral temporal artery of adequate length that has been subjected to careful histologic evaluation is high. If, however, the biopsy is negative, the decision to proceed with a contralateral biopsy will depend on the clinical situation, which includes the magnitude of clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of GCA and the availability of ancillary diagnostic vascular imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1499543255\"><span class=\"h4\">Temporal artery biopsy procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporal artery biopsies are obtained on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia in a surgical procedure suite or operating room. The procedure is brief and of low risk. The technique of temporal artery biopsy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporal-artery-biopsy-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporal artery biopsy technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287613563\"><span class=\"h4\">Diagnostic accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temporal artery biopsy is not a perfect test. False negative results occur, which are customarily ascribed to the segmental nature of the arteritic involvement by GCA, so-called &quot;skip areas.&quot; Because there is no definitive diagnostic test for GCA, the sensitivity of the temporal artery biopsy cannot be formally calculated. Reported rates of negative temporal artery biopsies in patients with diagnosed GCA as high as 30 to 44 percent are likely based on broad clinical definitions of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>One study of the diagnostic sensitivity of the temporal artery biopsy analyzed 17 reports of 2986 patients in whom temporal artery biopsies were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The gold standard was either the clinical diagnosis of GCA or the results from bilateral temporal artery biopsies. The mean sensitivity for a unilateral temporal artery biopsy was found to be 86.9 percent (95% CI 83.1-90.6).</p><p>The extent to which the sensitivity of the temporal artery biopsy is improved by the performance of bilateral biopsies remains a matter of debate. The range of reported discordance rates of bilateral temporal artery biopsies (positive on one side, negative on the other) has varied widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. A study of 1935 bilateral temporal artery biopsies, performed either sequentially or simultaneously, collected from 11 older reports, found a mean discordance rate (calculated from the total numbers of positive and negative biopsies) of 5.5 percent (95% CI 3.2-7.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In two studies of simultaneously performed biopsies of 132 and 250 patients, discordance rates of 9.8 and 4.4 percent, respectively, were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The increased yield of contralateral biopsy for the diagnosis is thus in the range of 5 percent.</p><p>The effect of biopsy length on the diagnostic yield of temporal artery biopsy has also been debated. Because of the issue of skip areas, longer biopsy specimens have traditionally been recommended, taking into account that there is an at least 10 percent shrinkage rate in the length of the temporal artery after formalin fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One retrospective study of 966 biopsies found that positive biopsies had a median post-fixation length that was statistically longer than negative biopsies (1.2 versus 1.0 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Another study of 1520 temporal artery biopsies concluded that specimens of shorter lengths were also of diagnostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In that study, statistical analysis suggested that the change point in the odds ratio for finding a positive temporal artery biopsy occurred at a biopsy length of 0.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In clinical practice, temporal artery biopsies performed for the diagnosis of suspected GCA are positive in 25 to 30 percent of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287613588\"><span class=\"h4\">Interpretation of histopathologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic histopathologic findings of GCA include a panarteritis, often most pronounced in the media, composed of CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F83910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83910 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F83908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83908 \">picture 2</a>). Giant cells are common but not requisite for the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F83907\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83907 \">picture 3</a>). The internal elastic lamina is often fragmented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109705 \">picture 4</a>). Whether inflammation confined to the adventitia carries the same diagnostic and prognostic importance as the typical transmural findings is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The significance of such a finding must be carefully assessed in the context of the overall clinical situation.</p><p>The finding of fibrinoid necrosis should suggest the possibility of an alternative diagnosis (ie, one of the systemic necrotizing vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109378\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109378 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. &quot;Healed arteritis,&quot; which refers to an eccentric disruption of the internal elastic lamina without a cellular infiltrate, is a histopathologic finding of uncertain significance without a standardized definition and should not be construed as a marker for active arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Rarely, temporal artery biopsy will disclose pathology other than GCA, such as systemic necrotizing vasculitis, including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, amyloidosis, or lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287610463\"><span class=\"h4\">Effects of glucocorticoid therapy on biopsy results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of a high diagnostic suspicion for GCA and the concern for possible catastrophic sight loss, scheduling of the biopsy should not interfere with initiation of glucocorticoid therapy. Resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate of GCA occurs slowly, and histopathologic evidence will be evident for at least a month after glucocorticoid therapy has been instituted. In one series, the rates of positive biopsies were similar in patients who were treated with glucocorticoid therapy for less than two weeks compared with those treated for more than two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Another study observed a drop-off in the yield of a positive temporal artery with continued treatment: a positive biopsy was found in 78 percent of patients with suspected GCA and who had less than two weeks of treatment, in 65 percent with treatment of two to four weeks' duration, and in 40 percent treated for more than four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another large series, however, reported that characteristic histopathologic changes of GCA were seen as frequently in biopsies obtained after four weeks of glucocorticoid therapy as after one to three days of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In some patients, the temporal artery biopsy can remain diagnostic for weeks and months after the start of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis#H179055075\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287610540\"><span class=\"h4\">Biopsy of other arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although GCA is also referred to as &quot;temporal&quot; arteritis, the temporal arteries are biopsied in this disease not because they are the focus of GCA, but because they are the blood vessels most easily accessible for diagnosis. Arteritic involvement tends to be widespread and can affect multiple extracranial vessels and other branches of the external carotid arteries. On rare occasions, other arteries (eg, the occipital artery) can also be biopsied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporal-artery-biopsy-technique#H17025549\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporal artery biopsy technique&quot;, section on 'Alternative biopsy sites'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287610573\"><span class=\"h4\">Predicting results of temporal artery biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical findings are often poorly predictive of temporal artery biopsy results. A meta-analysis assembled from 21 reports of 2680 temporal artery biopsies, positive and negative, found that the only symptoms associated with an increased likelihood of a positive biopsy were jaw claudication (likelihood ratio [LR] 4.2, 95% CI 2.8-6.2) and diplopia (LR 3.4, 95% CI, 1.3-8.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. None of the more prevalent clinical features of GCA, such as headache, constitutional symptoms, or polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), increased the likelihood of a positive biopsy. However, the sensitivities of jaw claudication and diplopia were low: In patients with positive biopsies, the former was found in only 34 percent and the latter in 9 percent.</p><p>Mathematical models, based on clinical and laboratory data that suggest a clinical diagnosis of GCA, have been unsuccessful in predicting a positive temporal artery biopsy. In one report of 535 patients undergoing temporal artery biopsy for suspected GCA, the combination of the following four findings correlated with a 95 percent probability of a negative temporal artery biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal or mildly elevated ESR (less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of jaw claudication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of temporal artery tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of synovitis, which suggests an alternative diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3542218838\"><span class=\"h3\">Color Doppler ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CDUS of the head, neck, and upper extremities has been proposed as a diagnostic surrogate for temporal artery biopsy. In the absence of extensive experience with this technology in routine clinical practice, however, temporal artery biopsy remains an essential diagnostic measure for the evaluation of suspected GCA.</p><p>CDUS has a resolution of 0.1 mm and thus can visualize the temporal arteries and other small extracranial arteries. In GCA, the temporal arteries show a circumferential dark area about the vascular lumen, thought to represent mural edema, dubbed the &quot;halo sign&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The halo, which measures 0.3 to 2.0 mm, is hypoechogenic, not anechogenic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109703\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109703 \">image 1</a>). The presence of bilateral halo signs of the temporal arteries is highly specific for GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The &quot;compression sign&quot; also has high specificity for the diagnosis; it refers to the persisting visibility of the halo during compression of the vessel lumen by the ultrasound probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Stenoses and occlusions can also be seen but are of lesser diagnostic value.</p><p>CDUS has several advantages: It is noninvasive, provides simultaneous image acquisition and interpretation, and involves no exposure to radiation. Other cranial arteries (eg, the facial, occipital, and vertebral arteries) can also be visualized. Scanning of the axillary and subclavian arteries can show evidence of large vessel vasculitis, which is missed with diagnostic studies limited to the cranial arteries, thereby augmenting the potential yield of CDUS as a diagnostic test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109704\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109704 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1756318360\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a nondiagnostic initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Published results on the sensitivity and specificity of CDUS for the diagnosis of GCA, however, are mixed. A 2010 meta-analysis of 285 patients studied with both CDUS and temporal artery biopsy found a weighted sensitivity of the halo sign compared with the gold standard of a positive temporal artery (an imperfect standard itself, as discussed above) of 75 percent (95% CI, 0.67-0.82) and a specificity of 83 percent (95% CI, 0.78-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similar results were obtained in a 2005 meta-analysis of earlier data, in which the weighted sensitivity and specificity of the halo sign compared with biopsy were 69 percent (95% CI, 0.57-0.79) and 82 percent (95% CI, 0.75-0.87), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A 2016 review of 10 studies, comprising 696 patients, found specificity to range from 78 to 100 percent but a wider extent of sensitivity from 55 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other reports have consistently described higher figures for sensitivity and specificity; in these centers, CDUS has superseded temporal artery biopsy as the initial diagnostic procedure of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>The heterogeneous conclusions about the utility of CDUS likely reflect the operator-dependent nature of the procedure and may also result from variability of equipment, probe settings, technique, and clinical context. Standardization of these factors may lead to more widespread use of CDUS for the diagnosis of GCA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287613773\"><span class=\"h3\">Limited role for other temporal artery imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), CT with angiography (CTA), and conventional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) lack sufficient spatial resolution to permit visualization of the temporal artery. PET scanning of the cranial arteries is also limited by high fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the brain.</p><p>Higher-resolution MRA can visualize the cranial arteries and, combined with contrast, demonstrate mural edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In a multicenter trial, using a reference standard of the final clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced MRA were 78.4 and 90.4 percent, respectively, in patients treated with glucocorticoids for five days or less; the sensitivity was decreased after treatment of 6 to 14 days' duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

These clinical features, however, are relatively uncommon, and more often the diagnosis becomes suspect in the presence of constitutional symptoms and signs, especially if occurring in the context of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The first evidence for large vessel GCA can also arise from advanced imaging exams performed in the course of evaluation for infection or malignancy or, on occasion, from histopathologic review of an aorta resected during aneurysm repair.

Conventional angiography is largely of historic interest.</p><p>Both CTA and MRA involve contrast administration and are tailored to evaluate vessels with high-resolution multiplanar image. In the absence of controlled, prospective studies, it is not possible to recommend MRA over CTA or vice versa. The clinician's selection of a given procedure will depend on the availability of local resources (technologic, professional, and fiscal).</p><p>Numerous case reports and series, especially those using CT and PET, demonstrate the value of these modalities for identifying large vessel GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/44,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,48-50</a>].</p><p>CDUS can visualize the axillary and subclavian arteries, but because of overlying bony structures, it cannot image the intrathoracic aorta. CT and CTA can demonstrate concentric mural thickening, continuous over long segments, a characteristic of large vessel inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F112613\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112613 \">image 3</a>). In addition, CTA can show vascular stenoses and dilations.

Like CTA, MRA can also identify stenoses and aneurysms. PET detects increased uptake of FDG by metabolically active cells, either malignant or inflammatory, and as such, can reveal sites of large vessel vasculitis. The combination of PET with CT enhances the delineation of vascular anatomy. With or without CT, PET can be useful for the detection of large vessel GCA presenting with fever of unknown origin or with nonlocalizing systemic symptoms and signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F112575\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112575 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>There are caveats for all the imaging techniques.

The interpretation of findings on PET scanning remains largely qualitative, as standards for quantitative analysis have not been codified. Exposure to ionizing radiation, the need for intravenous contrast, and the economic costs of the various modalities, apart from CDUS, are also considerations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2804868471\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of screening for large vessel GCA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced imaging is essential in the diagnosis of large vessel GCA. Although we do not routinely screen for large vessel involvement, in some centers such imaging is performed in all patients with diagnosed GCA to survey for large vessel involvement, especially aortic disease. There are, however, no long-term large cohort studies that have examined the utility of advanced imaging in predicting outcomes of large vessel disease or assessing response to treatment.</p><p>Aortitis is a feature of large vessel involvement in GCA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F83912\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83912 \">picture 6</a>). Prospective imaging studies have demonstrated aortitis at the time of initial diagnosis of biopsy-proved GCA in 45 percent of patients evaluated by CT and 65 percent of patients evaluated by CTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/44,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,52</a>].

Reports on the incidence of such aneurysms are mixed, in large part because of heterogeneity in methods of data collection and ascertainment. A meta-analysis of nine studies found that thoracic aortic aneurysms were detected in 2 to 8 percent of GCA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Data on the frequency of aortic aneurysm in GCA patients compared with the general population are also mixed. A previous population study found patients with GCA to be 17.3 times more likely to develop thoracic aortic aneurysm than an unmatched control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A large cohort study from the United Kingdom of 6999 GCA patients, as defined by ICD-10 codes, and 41,994 controls, matched for age and sex, found a twofold increased relative risk of aortic aneurysm in GCA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In both studies, smoking and male sex were independent predictors for aortic aneurysm.</p><p>The rate of actual complications of aortic aneurysms in GCA (ie, dissection and rupture) is also not easily quantified, again owing to methodological heterogeneity and small numbers of patients, but based on reported series it lies between 2 and 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Finally, whether treatment impacts aortitis, the development of aneurysms and their outcomes is unknown.</p><p>All these considerations &ndash; the frequency of aneurysms in GCA, the rate of their complications, and the effects of treatment &ndash; bear on the question as to whether screening for aortic aneurysm is warranted. Screening must also take into account cost-benefit factors: A chest radiograph is inexpensive but insensitive for the detection of aneurysm of the thoracic aorta; cross-sectional imaging (CT and MRI) are sensitive but expensive.</p><p>At this time, in view of the limitations of data, routine screening for aortic involvement at the time of diagnosis is not recommended, and the clinician must make decisions in this regard on a case-by-case basis. Risk factors for aortic aneurysm in GCA, particularly male sex and smoking, and for aortic aneurysm in general, especially hypertension, should be taken into consideration. As the incidence of aortic aneurysms in GCA increases over time, ongoing clinical vigilance is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326473138\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2019119433\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with a positive biopsy or imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) should not be based on clinical presentation alone but should be premised on histopathologic proof or evidence from imaging exams.

The typical histopathologic finding is a non-necrotizing panarteritis.</p><p>Skilled operators can use color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) of the head, neck and upper extremities as a substitute for the temporal artery biopsy as an initial diagnostic procedure. In active arteritis, a hypoechoic area about the lumen of affected vessels, called the halo sign, can be demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H1093208711\" class=\"local\">'Temporal artery biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3542218838\" class=\"local\">'Color Doppler ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p>While the typical presentation of GCA involves the cranial arteries, in other patients symptoms and signs arise from large vessel involvement, referred to as large vessel GCA. The diagnosis of large vessel GCA is established on the basis of imaging of the aorta and large arteries. (See <a href=\"#H3823138431\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for large vessel GCA'</a> above.)</p><p>Although the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) formulated classification criteria for GCA in 1990, they should not be used as diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. They were intended for differentiating GCA from other forms of vasculitis in research studies, but lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used in diagnosing individual patients.

Glucocorticoids can ameliorate a variety of symptoms, including malaise, headache, and fevers, as well as lower or even normalize the acute phase reactants. But in some patients with classic clinical presentations for GCA, temporal artery biopsies and other diagnostic procedures are negative, and no alternative diagnoses are plausible.
