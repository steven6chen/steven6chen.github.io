It can result from congenital defects in the membrane transport systems of the small intestinal epithelium (primary malabsorption) or from acquired defects in the epithelial absorptive surface (secondary malabsorption). Another factor that can interfere with nutrient absorption is maldigestion, which is due to impaired digestion of nutrients within the intestinal lumen or at the terminal digestive site of the brush border membrane of mucosal epithelial cells.</p><p>Although malabsorption and maldigestion are pathophysiologically different, the processes underlying digestion and absorption are interdependent, so that in clinical practice, the term malabsorption has come to denote derangements in either process.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the treatment of malabsorption. Issues that are relevant to specific diseases (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, and short bowel syndrome) are discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of malabsorption are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of nutrient absorption and malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRIENT PROCESSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three steps are required for normal nutrient absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luminal events (referred to as the &quot;Luminal&quot; phase)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Processing at the brush border and absorption into the intestinal mucosa (referred to as the &quot;Absorptive&quot; or &quot;Mucosal&quot; phase)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Processing within the enterocyte and transport into the circulation (referred to as the &quot;Postabsorptive&quot; or &quot;Processing&quot; phase)</p><p/><p>Malabsorption can result from defects in any of these three phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Furthermore, one or more mechanisms may exist concurrently. Thus, while the clinical sequelae may be the same, the underlying pathophysiology and treatment may be different.</p><p>Malabsorption either may be global or partial (isolated). Global malabsorption results from diseases associated with either diffuse mucosal involvement or a reduced absorptive surface. An example is celiac sprue in which diffuse mucosal disease can lead to impaired absorption of almost all nutrients. Partial or isolated malabsorption results from diseases that interfere with the absorption of specific nutrients. An example is pernicious anemia, a disease that leads to defective cobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major principles underlying the management of patients with malabsorption and maldigestion, and appropriate care of such patients in the majority of cases necessitates that each of these three are addressed: (1) identification and treatment of the underlying disease, (2) treatment of the diarrhea that often accompanies these disorders, and (3) identification and correction of nutritional deficits.</p><p>The first principle is critical because many diseases may lead to malabsorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743 \">table 1</a>). As a result, an exact diagnosis is essential in the design of a successful therapeutic regimen.</p><p>It is also critical to firmly establish the presence of malabsorption before proceeding with treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>). This may seem obvious but it is a principle that is all too frequently ignored. As an example, chronic diarrhea that follows a sizeable small intestinal resection is not invariably due to malabsorption; in many cases it is instead due to cholorrhea (a secretory diarrhea that arises from excess bile acids entering the colon) and which requires a very different form of therapy than is required for malabsorption.</p><p>Management of diarrhea becomes an important aspect of the therapeutic plan in circumstances in which the underlying pathophysiology cannot be entirely corrected. Nonspecific antidiarrheal agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a>, diphenoxylate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, and deodorized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tincture-of-opium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tincture of opium</a>, are useful in this regard. Loperamide should be tried first because it is largely metabolized on first pass through the liver and does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier, minimizing any central nervous system (CNS) side-effects. It is also generally less expensive than diphenoxylate with atropine. Deodorized tincture of opium is useful because of its high potency, which can be particularly useful in severe cases of malabsorption. Because it carries with it a small risk of addiction, patients should be asked about past drug addictions before it is prescribed. In patients with very rapid intestinal transit, the rate of pill dissolution may be a limiting factor: both loperamide and diphenoxylate with atropine also come as liquids, and these forms can be useful in this setting.</p><p>In many cases dietary maneuvers are helpful adjuncts in the effective management of diarrhea due to malabsorption. Patients should generally avoid more than one serving a day of caffeine-containing beverages since such drinks may promote diarrhea. Highly-sugared beverages such as soft drinks and fruit juices can also markedly increase the volume of diarrhea. This is particularly true in patients with short gut syndrome, where insufficient intestinal absorptive surface remains to compensate for the hyperosmolar effects of such drinks. Diluting soft drinks and fruit juices with water in a 1:1 ratio can be helpful for patients who enjoy such drinks. Patients whose diarrhea causes problems with dehydration and electrolyte disorders should use an oral rehydration solution daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Fluid repletion'</a>.)</p><p>In patients in whom bile acid depletion has an important role in fat malabsorption (eg, chronic cholestasis, major ileal resection), therapy with exogenous conjugated bile acids can decrease steatorrhea. Although such preparations are no longer available by prescription, there are some reliable companies that sell desiccated ox and cattle bile over the internet. However, natural bile acid preparations often increase the volume of diarrhea due to colonic secretion occurring after bacteria in the colon deconjugate the bile acids. This can occur even though they are decreasing the magnitude of steatorrhea. This is generally not of concern in patients who have undergone a colectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For patients who have a colon in continuity with the fecal stream, however, a synthetic conjugated bile acid that does not undergo bacterial deconjugation (cholylsarcosine) may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Apart from reducing diarrhea, cholylsarcosine reduces urinary oxalate excretion in patients with short bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cholylsarcosine is presently not available in the United States. In the setting of diarrhea due to ileal dysfunction, it is important to distinguish between diarrhea caused by steatorrhea versus cholorrheic diarrhea. The latter almost always responds promptly to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>, whereas bile acid supplementation is generally ineffective and in fact often exacerbates the diarrhea. Conversely, cholestyramine should not be used for steatorrhea, since it will exacerbate the malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble nutrients. By history, the length of diseased or resected ileum is highly predictive; &lt;100 cm generally produces cholorrhea, and &gt;100 cm produces steatorrhea. Tests that determine whether excessive fat excretion is present can also distinguish between the two conditions.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=teduglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Teduglutide</a> is a long-acting homolog of the naturally-occurring hormone, GLP-2. It is administered by daily subcutaneous injection at a dose of 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. It has trophic effects upon the intestine, anatomically and functionally increasing its absorptive surface area. In a 24-week randomized placebo-controlled trial in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN)-dependent patients with short gut syndrome, teduglutide was associated with an improvement in intestinal absorption and nitrogen balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An extension of that trial demonstrated the safety of the medication over 52 weeks, and led to &gt;20 percent reduction in nightly TPN requirements in the majority of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Teduglutide may prove to be an important agent in the treatment of short bowel syndrome.</p><p>Consultation with a dietitian is frequently useful, but in complicated cases assistance from a physician who specializes in nutrition support is preferred since complex nutritional issues are frequently encountered in this setting. It is generally accepted that unintentional weight loss associated with illness that exceeds 10 percent of usual body weight is associated with excess morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition. This degree of weight loss should lead to an aggressive plan for nutritional restitution in the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTATION AND RESTRICTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with malabsorption have only mild or moderate weight loss. If the disease leading to malabsorption can be specifically treated, most patients can continue with normal dietary intake. Oral supplementation with vitamins and minerals is usually sufficient to correct existing deficiencies, although over the few weeks immediately following the identification of a vitamin or mineral deficiency more rapid recovery can be achieved by supplementation with 5 to 10 times the Recommended Dietary Allowance or RDA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51385 \">table 2</a>). In patients in whom the malabsorption cannot be corrected, the amount of a particular micronutrient necessary to maintain normal status may continue to be 5 to 10 times the RDA.</p><p>Patients with substantial steatorrhea may require supplementation with more polar forms of fat-soluble vitamins. An example is using the 25-hydroxylated form of vitamin D (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcifediol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcifediol</a>), which is more polar than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D2</a> or D3 and is therefore more easily absorbed in patients with fat malabsorption. The serum calcium should be monitored for the first few weeks of therapy with this naturally occurring analogue since it is more potent than vitamin D2 or D3, and can more easily produce hypercalcemia. More recently, 1-hydroxyvitamin D (Hectorol), which is also more polar than vitamin D2 or D3, has become available. In assessing blood levels of vitamin D in patients taking this compound, it is necessary to check 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels rather than the more conventional 25-hydroxyvitamin D, since the 1-hydroxyvitamin D will be converted directly into the dihydroxy form.</p><p>Similarly, a polar form of vitamin E, d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) has proven to be well absorbed in situations where conventional vitamin E is poorly absorbed due to fat malabsorption.</p><p>Some fat-soluble vitamins can also be obtained in capsules containing an emulsifying solution (eg, Aquasol A, Aquasol E). However, it remains unproven if these preparations actually enhance absorption of the vitamins.</p><p>A variety of other nutrients are often required in specific situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation are usually required in celiac disease; in some cases, deficiencies of these nutrients are the presenting manifestation of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium and magnesium supplementation are required after extensive small intestinal resection, or in any setting where there is severe fat malabsorption. Both vitamin D malabsorption as well as excessive fecal loss of calcium and magnesium (because of binding to malabsorbed fatty acids in the intestinal lumen) contribute to these deficiencies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>). Vitamin D deficiency worsens calcium deficiency. Optimal maintenance of bone mass is best achieved when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are maintained in the upper end of the normative range, or slightly above (ie, 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> among those using vitamins D2, D3 or 25-hydroxy vitamin D as a supplement. Among those taking the 1-hydroxylated form of the vitamin, the optimal blood concentrations of vitamin D metabolites are less clear. It would probably best in the latter situation to aim for a blood level within the normative range for 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. In patients who have fat malabsorption and a colon in continuity with the fecal stream, calcium supplementation also assists in the prevention of nephrolithiasis due to oxalate stones. When calcium supplementation is administered for this purpose, it should be taken with meals, thereby enabling the calcium to bind up the oxalate contained in the meal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnesium is also unique among the minerals since it is primarily absorbed in the distal small intestine and colon. In patients who have lost substantial amounts of distal small gut and colon, magnesium depletion may arise even in the absence of fat malabsorption. Magnesium salts, when taken orally, often induce an osmotic diarrhea so parenteral repletion may be necessary.</p><p/><p>It is important to recall that serum concentrations of calcium and magnesium may be poor indicators of homeostasis of these cations. The possibility of normomagnesemic magnesium depletion (in which there is isolated intracellular magnesium depletion) should be considered as a possible cause of refractory hypokalemia or unexplained hypocalcemia in patients at high risk for magnesium loss since magnesium is necessary for both parathyroid hormone (PTH) release and for its actions in the target tissues. Measuring the response to an oral magnesium load has been suggested as a clinically meaningful method to detect normomagnesemic magnesium depletion. The utility is uncertain; it may be simpler to administer magnesium if there are reasons to suspect magnesium depletion. As an example, magnesium depletion should be suspected in any patient with the otherwise unexplained combination of hypocalcemia and hypokalemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypomagnesemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypomagnesemia&quot;, section on 'Normomagnesemic magnesium depletion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;</a>). Magnesium salts are poorly absorbed and may exacerbate underlying diarrhea so intermittent parenteral administration is sometimes necessary.</p><p>In the setting of persistent malabsorption, occasional monitoring of bone mass with dual photon absorptiometry (&quot;DEXA&quot;) is indicated since the incidence of metabolic bone disease is quite high in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional dietary principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary restrictions in some diseases leading to malabsorption can result in full restoration of mucosal function and nutritional status. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination of a particular carbohydrate in patients with isolated disaccharidase deficiencies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of nutrient absorption and malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in dietary long-chain fatty acids below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in patients with steatorrhea can reduce stool volume and stool fat content to acceptable levels. However, this may unduly restrict the patient's ability to consume sufficient calories, in which case supplementation with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil or MCT-based liquid supplements is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The use of pure MCT as a cooking oil, spread on toast, or salad dressing can be a double-edged sword since it occasionally induces nausea or an osmotic diarrhea. MCT-based liquid nutritional supplements are no longer readily available in the United States. However, a substitute can be made by adding 10 mL of MCT oil to 8 ounces of nonfat milk, to which is added one packet of a powdered instant breakfast meal and briefly emulsified in a blender. Nonfat lactase-treated milk should be used in patients who are lactose intolerant. Among those with short bowel syndrome, carefully performed energy balance studies suggest that MCT is most effective in patients whose colons remain in the fecal stream, since a major site of MCT absorption appears to be the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low-fat diet is an important component of the treatment regimen for patients with fat malabsorption due to short bowel syndrome if the colon is in continuity. Some authorities suggest that a high fat diet can also be used with an intact colon to increase energy absorption. Such an approach can be considered in individual patients, but the tradeoff will probably be increased diarrhea (due to a secretory diarrhea produced by free fatty acids stimulating the colonic mucosa) and divalent cation loss (due to calcium and magnesium bound to malabsorbed free fatty acids).</p><p/><p>Fat restriction does not present an advantage with respect to net fluid, energy, nitrogen, or electrolyte absorption if a jejunostomy or ileostomy is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the latter situations, a patient may more easily achieve caloric goals, and thereby a stable weight, if no fat restriction is imposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactose intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elimination of milk and milk products from the diet leads to improvement in primary lactase deficiency. In acquired forms of lactose intolerance due to small intestinal disease, treatment of the underlying disease or its complications may improve lactose tolerance without requiring dietary modification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence and underlying cause of lactose intolerance in patients with small intestinal disease should be established prior to suggesting a lactose-free diet. As an example, the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly higher in patients with Crohn disease with extensive small bowel involvement than in those with colonic disease alone. However, lactose malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may result from factors other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diminished small bowel transit time, each of which can improve during treatment.</p><p>Recommending a lactose-free diet in such patients imposes an added inconvenience and deprives them of a valuable source of nutrition (especially calcium and vitamin D). When symptoms of lactose intolerance arise during a flare of the disease, restricting dietary lactose temporarily may be sufficient. Commercially available lactose-free milk products can help to minimize symptoms, allowing for more generous ingestion of dairy foods.</p><p>Finally, intolerance to dairy products is not necessarily due to lactose intolerance. Allergy to milk proteins, as well as psychologic factors, may also have a role. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fructose intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to one-half of the population cannot completely absorb a load of 25 g of fructose while daily intake varies from about 11 to 54 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. In a study of healthy volunteers, 10 percent had positive breath test results after consuming 25 g of fructose while 80 percent had positive results with a 50 g load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Concern over fructose malabsorption has grown with the increasingly widespread use of high fructose corn syrups that are used to sweeten a wide variety of commercial food products. However, the degree to which fructose malabsorption contributes to gastrointestinal symptoms is not clearly established. Gastrointestinal symptoms related to fructose malabsorption appear to be more common in individuals who have an underlying functional bowel disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/16,18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,22</a>]. Unabsorbed fructose provides a substrate for rapid bacterial fermentation (causing gas), and may have other physiological consequences including an increased osmotic load and alteration of gastrointestinal motility (which may cause diarrhea), and a change in the profile of the bacterial flora.</p><p>Dietary fructose is consumed in two forms: as a monosaccharide, and as a disaccharide, since it is contained in sucrose (glucose-fructose). For reasons that are incompletely understood, fructose absorption from sucrose is greater than the absorption of fructose as a monosaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].</p><p>The ability to absorb fructose (even in those with malabsorption) depends not only upon the amount of fructose consumed, but the presence of other sugars ingested with it. Concomitant ingestion of glucose, galactose, and some amino acids increases fructose absorption, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> decreases it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>]. These observations have implications for dietary recommendations in patients in whom fructose malabsorption is suspected since foods that contain fructose may be well tolerated if they also contain glucose but may be less well tolerated if they also contain sorbitol (although sorbitol itself can cause diarrhea). Thus, it is the net amount of fructose that is important.</p><p>There are two commercially used forms of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), one that contains approximately 42 percent and the other approximately 55 percent fructose (HFCS-55). The other main ingredient is glucose. For example, a 12-ounce soda containing HFCS-55 has about 22 g of fructose and 17 g of glucose providing an excess of only 5 g of fructose per can, an amount that can be absorbed completely in most healthy individuals. Thus, despite an abundance of fructose, HFCS may not be a major culprit in causing symptoms in individuals with fructose malabsorption (provided that its ingestion is modest) since it also contains similar amounts of glucose.</p><p>Patients in whom a trial of dietary avoidance of fructose is desired should be advised to avoid foods that contain a high net amount of fructose (ie, more fructose than glucose, or more fructose and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> than glucose). In particular, they should reduce or temporarily eliminate their intake of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods sweetened with &quot;fructose&quot; or &quot;crystalline fructose.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juices and fruits containing high net amounts of fructose (eg, apples, pears, sweet cherries, prunes, dates), and beverages sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. If consumed, these foods should be eaten with meals, and beverages sweetened with high fructose corn syrup limited to 12 ounces. Because long-term elimination of these healthful fruits is not generally advisable, it should only be entertained if objective evidence of fructose malabsorption is obtained (see below) or if unequivocal benefits are obtained with their elimination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Honey, which contains 35 g of fructose and 29 g of glucose per 100 g (3 tablespoons).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sorbitol-containing candies and gums, which, as noted above, may decrease fructose absorption but may cause diarrhea because of the osmotic effects and breakdown products of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> and sugar alcohol. Many foods are labeled &quot;sugarless,&quot; which is a misnomer because the products contain poorly absorbed sugar moieties.</p><p/><p>A fructose breath test has been suggested as an objective means of identifying fructose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Further validation of the predictive value of this test is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment in severe maldigestion and steatorrhea due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a low fat diet and administration of exogenous pancreatic enzymes. To optimize the efficacy of treatment, the management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency must be individually tailored to account for both the underlying cause and any associated disturbance in gastrointestinal physiology. In addition, the properties of the pancreatic enzyme preparations and adjuvant drugs need to be taken into consideration.</p><p>Several commercial preparations are microencapsulated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51385 \">table 2</a>), and are thereby designed to be acid-resistant to avoid enzyme inactivation by gastric juice. As a general rule, 30,000 international units (IU) (90,000 United States Pharmacopeia [USP]) of pancreatic lipase, swallowed during each full meal, should suffice in reducing steatorrhea and preventing weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 3</a>). One-half of that dose should be administered with snacks. Determining the adequate amount of lipase can be confusing since the amount of lipase in pancreatic supplements is typically expressed in USP units. One IU is equivalent to approximately 2 to 3 USP units. </p><p>If symptoms persist, supplemental therapy with H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors is often effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nonencapsulated formulations may be more successful in patients who are achlorhydric or who have dyssynchronous gastric emptying (eg, Billroth II anatomy), since there is no need to protect the enzymes from acid. Microencapsulated formulations will only delay the release of the enzymes in the proximal small intestine, and are therefore intended more for patients who have retained the ability to secrete gastric acid.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

If the underlying disease leading to malabsorption can be specifically treated, most patients can continue with normal dietary intake. Dietary principles for patients with more severe, intractable, or specific forms of malabsorption are summarized above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nutrient supplementation and restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary restrictions in some diseases leading to malabsorption can result in full restoration of mucosal function and nutritional status.
