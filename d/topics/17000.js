The MIP reflects the strength of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, while the MEP reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles. A well validated alternative or additional test of inspiratory muscle strength is maximal sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP). Common indications for measurement of the MIP, SNIP, and MEP include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory muscle weakness is suspected, such as in a patient with known neuromuscular disease, a weak cough, or unexplained dyspnea (particularly orthopnea) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung function tests show reduced vital capacity (VC) or an increased diffusion capacity of unknown etiology </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of whether known respiratory muscle weakness has improved, remained stable, or worsened</p><p/><p>Measurement, interpretation, quality assurance, and clinical applications of the MIP, SNIP, and MEP are discussed in this topic review.

The device should contain a small air leak to prevent the patient from generating pressure by using their cheek muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In specialist laboratories, often undertaking research, MIP and MEP will be measured using a flanged mouthpiece attached to a short rigid tube with a three-way tap or valve system to allow normal breathing followed by the MIP or MEP maneuver. The pressure in the tube is measured by a pressure transducer connected to it by a narrow gauge catheter, and the output from the strain gauge is displayed on a computer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To achieve a maximum value it is important to explain and demonstrate the maneuver to the patient. Place a rubber mouthpiece with flanges, on the device. Instruct the patient to seal his or her lips firmly around the mouthpiece, exhale slowly and completely, and then try to breath in as hard as possible. The patient should maintain inspiratory pressure for at least 1.5 seconds and the largest negative pressure sustained for at least one second (not a transient spike) should be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These durations are estimated by the individual supervising the test. Allow the patient to rest for about one minute and then repeat the maneuver five times. Provide verbal or visual feedback after each maneuver. The goal is for the variability among measurements to be less than 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Some patients with orofacial muscle weakness may not be able to obtain a good seal with the lips. It is helpful to allow such patients to use their hands to press their lips around the mouthpiece during each maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Alternatively, the technologist or physician can press the patient's lips against the mouthpiece to obtain a good seal or a face mask interface can be substituted.</p><p>Report the maximum value, the predicted value, and the lower limit of the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However some use a larger diameter stiff rubber tube, pressed against the face, around the mouth. The MEP, but not the MIP can be greater using such a tube because leaks are difficult to avoid with conventional mouthpieces, particularly when patients generate large pressures. Instruct the patient to take a maximal inspiration, hold the mouthpiece firmly in their mouth, and then blow as hard as possible, similar to inflating a very stiff balloon. The patient should maintain expiratory pressure for at least 1.5 seconds and the largest positive pressure sustained for at least one second (not a transient spike) should be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Allow the patient to rest for about one minute and then repeat the maneuver five times. Provide verbal or visual feedback after each maneuver. The goal is for the variability among measurements to be less than 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Report the maximum value, the predicted value, and the lower limit of the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patient cooperation and effort should also be noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83782348\"><span class=\"h2\">Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SNIP is a noninvasive test of inspiratory muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Advantages include the simplicity of the sniff maneuver for most patients and the absence of a mouthpiece, which is particularly helpful for patients who have facial weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure test is performed by wedging a bung into one nostril, through which a thin catheter connected to a pressure transducer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81704 \">figure 1</a>) has been passed (completely obstructs flow through that nostril). The patient is instructed to sniff as strongly as possible through the contralateral unobstructed nostril. The pressure measured in the obstructed nostril is an indicator of inspiratory muscle strength.</p><p>The SNIP is closely similar to sniff esophageal pressure in patients who do not have severe airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>]. With severe airways obstruction there is a significant pressure gradient between intrathoracic and nasal pressure. The SNIP is repeated until a maximal peak negative pressure is obtained (less than 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O variation) which may require up to 10 efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Report the maximum value and lower limit of the normal range. Patient cooperation and effort should be noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal respiratory muscle strength is identified by comparing the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) to a reference range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Reference range</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal values for MIP, MEP and SNIP are wide ranging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102592\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102592 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102591 \">table 2</a>). Note that pressures, particularly MEP, obtained using a conventional flanged rubber mouthpiece, are lower than those obtained with a rigid rubber tube applied to the face around the lips. MIP and MEP values are lower in females and fall with advancing age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70873 \">figure 2</a>). The large standard deviations of the data mean that the lower limits of normal are approximately 50 percent of predicted normal values. </p><p>Patients with lung hyperinflation due to severe airway obstruction may generate a low MIP despite normal inspiratory muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. This is due to shortening of diaphragmatic muscle fibers and the mechanical disadvantage conferred by lung hyperinflation. In such patients expectations of MIP should be adjusted downward as lung hyperinflation increases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70968 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In patients with airways obstruction (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) the transmission of intrathoracic pressure to the nose is impaired and the sniff esophageal pressure is more negative than nasal measurements; thus, SNIP in this population generally underestimates inspiratory muscle strength.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83782846\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the MIP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SNIP, or MEP are lower than the expected, respiratory muscle weakness should be suspected, but in some cases the low results may reflect poor effort or difficulties with performing the maneuvers. Diagnostic accuracy for inspiratory muscle weakness is improved when MIP and SNIP are both measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study of 182 patients referred to a specialist laboratory for assessment of possible respiratory muscle weakness, 40 percent were diagnosed as weak by MIP, 43 percent by SNIP, and 30 percent by MIP plus SNIP. The combination of MIP and SNIP therefore reduced the diagnosis of weakness by 20 percent compared to either test alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Test characteristics of the MIP, MEP, and SNIP have been extensively studied. Normal results reliably exclude clinically significant respiratory muscle weakness (ie, good negative predictive value), but low values do not reliably confirm inspiratory muscle weakness (ie, poor positive predictive value) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The poor positive predictive value reflects the high frequency of falsely low measurements due to poor effort or technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Given these test characteristics, clinicians must accept the uncertainty that exists when the MIP, SNIP, or MEP are close to the lower limit of normal or when the test quality is poor. In such cases, the tests can be repeated or more complex and invasive tests of respiratory muscle strength can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Additional tests (invasive)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Detecting change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detecting a change in respiratory muscle strength can be useful for identifying improvement or progression of the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, true change must be distinguished from normal variation.</p><p>Studies in healthy individuals demonstrate that 95 percent of normal test-to-test variation has a magnitude less than 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Ideally, such a study should be performed by each laboratory using patients with neuromuscular disease. However, in the absence of such data, it is reasonable to use a change of more than 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O as the threshold to identify true change of respiratory muscle strength.</p><p>A true change in respiratory muscle strength should be distinguished from a clinically important change, which has not been reported but is likely to be the same or greater. Supporting this view, several studies have demonstrated that improvement of the MIP as large as -13 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and the MEP as large as 24 cm H<sub>2</sub>O did not correlate with symptomatic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY ASSURANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The validity of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) are directly related to the quality of the test from which they were measured. Potential sources of error that should be considered include patient effort and technique, pressure measurement accuracy, and the patient-device interface.</p><p>Patient effort and technique are probably the most common causes of error. Several interventions can minimize their impact:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The technologist should act as an enthusiastic and encouraging coach, eliciting maximal effort from the patient for each maneuver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most clinical laboratories perform only five maneuvers because this is what was done in most studies. However, the best values during a test session are sometimes obtained after multiple maneuvers (up to 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>]. It is prudent that up to three additional maneuvers be performed if the last measurement was the highest for the test session, or if the second highest measurement is not at least 90 percent of the highest measurement.</p><p/><p>The prevalence of errors due to inaccurate pressure gauges or transducers is unknown. However, it is suggested that pressure gauges or transducers be verified approximately once a week by delivering 50 and 100 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of pressure via a manometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The difference between the pressure gauge measurement and the delivered pressure should be less than 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>Error can also be related to the patient-device interface, particularly when measuring the MEP. To overcome these potential sources of error, the patient-device interface should be assessed during each maneuver. Patients with severe weakness of the facial muscles who are unable to create a seal with a standard mouthpiece may benefit from a face mask interface, having the technologist press their lips against the mouthpiece to obtain a good seal, or an alternative test of respiratory muscle strength. In contrast, patients who do not have respiratory muscle weakness may require a tube interface (a wide diameter rubber tube pressed firmly against the face around the lips) if the standard mouthpiece or face mask seal is broken during the maneuver. The latter is based on several small observational studies that demonstrated that patients without respiratory muscle weakness frequently broke their seal with a standard mouthpiece or face mask, but not a tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], particularly during expiratory efforts.</p><p>We propose that the quality of each test be graded according to patient effort and repeatability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72052 \">table 3</a>). In this system, excellent effort and repeatability (&lt;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O difference among measurements) would receive the highest quality grade, while poor effort or poor repeatability (&gt;20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O difference among measurements) would receive the poorest grade. In general, 80 to 90 percent of healthy adults achieve less than 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O difference among measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once testing is complete and the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) have been determined, they can be applied to the patient. The MIP, MEP, and SNIP are rarely used alone; rather, they are considered in conjunction with other measures, most commonly the vital capacity (VC) or the forced vital capacity (FVC). Common settings in which the MIP, MEP, and SNIP are helpful include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the severity of respiratory muscle weakness, including prediction of clinical sequelae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the course of the respiratory muscle weakness</p><p/><p>The role of the MIP, MEP, and SNIP in each of these settings is discussed in detail in this section. Pulmonary function testing in the evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness is discussed separately.

Possible etiologies include neuromuscular diseases (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) or systemic conditions that affect skeletal muscle strength (eg, thyrotoxicosis, heart failure, malnutrition, post intensive care unit syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/10,22,23,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22,23,31-35</a>].

The low maximum pressures therefore relate to disease severity and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>MIP, SNIP, and MEP measurements can localize respiratory muscle weakness. A low MIP and SNIP but a normal MEP suggests isolated inspiratory muscle weakness (usually diaphragmatic), while a low MIP, SNIP, and MEP suggests generalized skeletal muscle weakness. Isolated expiratory muscle weakness (normal MIP and SNIP and low MEP) is rare. From a practical standpoint, this differentiation is seldom of diagnostic benefit because many of the causes of respiratory muscle weakness can cause either inspiratory muscle weakness or generalized skeletal muscle weakness.</p><p>A low-normal or slightly low MIP, SNIP, or MEP can also be associated with factors other than specific respiratory muscle weakness. Such factors include older age, weak handgrip strength, malnutrition, poor health, low physical activity, short stature, smoking, and suboptimal technician coaching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/3,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29,30</a>].

This is particularly true for sedentary patients without heart or lung disease. Such patients place minimal demand on their respiratory muscles and may not become symptomatic until they have severe respiratory muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial measurements of the MIP and MEP can be used to evaluate whether the respiratory muscle weakness has improved, remained stable, or worsened. This is particularly helpful for evaluating response to therapy (eg, immunosuppressive therapy for myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) and for planning an intervention (eg, mechanical ventilation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Assess need for ventilatory support'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparing measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vital capacity (VC) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) are widely used alternatives to the MIP and MEP that are used to follow the disease course. The difference between the VC and the FVC should be clearly understood. The VC is the maximum volume of gas that can be expelled from full inspiration. The FVC is also the maximum volume of gas that can be expelled from full inspiration, but it is measured when the patient is exhaling with maximal speed and effort. The VC is usually higher than the FVC, with the difference being directly related to the degree of obstruction.</p><p>Direct comparison of the MIP and FVC demonstrates the following differences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When measured in the upright position, a decreased FVC is less specific for respiratory muscle strength (it can also be decreased in interstitial lung disease, chest wall disease, and other conditions) and less sensitive for changes in inspiratory muscle strength, compared to the MIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because relatively small pressures are required to fully inflate the normal lung the inspiratory muscle can be substantially weakened before the VC is much reduced.

In our practice, we make clinical decisions after measuring the MIP, SNIP, MEP, and FVC. We measure upright and supine FVC.

Non volitional abdominal (expiratory) muscle strength can be measured by recording gastric pressure following surface magnetic stimulation posteriorly in the mid line at the level of T10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Phrenic nerve stimulation, in combination with the recording of diaphragm EMG by an esophageal electrode, allows measurement of phrenic nerve latency and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Using these complex tests respiratory muscle function and strength can be accurately assessed in virtually all patients; for example, such tests accurately predict survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The most powerful biomarker for mortality stratification is Twitch Pdi, but the predictive power of Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure is also excellent. A vta; capacity (VC) within normal range suggests a good prognosis at three months but is of little other value. Sequential data show a linear decline for direct measures of respiratory muscle strength, whereas VC shows little or no decline until 12 months before death or ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory muscle strength can be assessed noninvasively by measuring the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP or PImax), maximal sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), and the maximal expiratory pressure (MEP or PEmax). The MIP and SNIP reflect the strength of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, while the MEP reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common indications for measurement of the MIP, SNIP, and MEP include clinically suspected respiratory muscle weakness, lung function consistent with respiratory muscle weakness (eg, restrictive pattern, low vital capacity, raised diffusion capacity), and evaluation of whether respiratory muscle weakness has improved, remained stable, or worsened. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal respiratory muscle strength is identified by comparing the MIP, SNIP, and MEP to a reference range. When lung hyperinflation exists, the MIP and SNIP are reduced independent of muscle strength. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Reference range'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal MIP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SNIP reliably excludes inspiratory muscle weakness (ie, good negative predictive value), but a low MIP does not reliably confirm inspiratory muscle weakness (ie, poor positive predictive value), since submaximal patient effort or poor technique are common. When a low MIP is recorded, the measurement of SNIP is helpful to confirm weakness; it is known that multiple tests increase diagnostic accuracy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential sources of error that should be considered include patient effort and technique, pressure gauge accuracy, and the patient-device interface. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Quality assurance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once testing is complete and the MIP, SNIP, and MEP have been determined, the measures can be applied to the patient. This may include diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness, determination of its severity, prediction of its clinical sequelae, or evaluation of its clinical course. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical application'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness is in doubt, some clinicians will perform more invasive testing including sniff esophageal pressure, sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure, and gastric pressure, all of which require the insertion of a pressure measuring catheters and phrenic nerve stimulation to measure twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (Twitch Pdi).
