Vital signs like pulse, blood pressure, and temperature are essential in assessing critically ill infants. Newborns on a therapeutic hypothermia protocol for perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy may be on a cooling blanket, with core body temperature being brought down to 34&deg;C. Skeletal muscle paralysis may be induced for ventilatory management and may influence the assessment of eye movements, motor function, or motor response to sensory stimuli. It is also important to assess whether the newborn is in pain by identifying clinical markers for pain (eg, changes in facial expression, including crying) and elevated heart rate and blood pressure.

Passage through the birth canal may result in moulding, a temporary asymmetry of the skull caused by overlapping or overriding of the sutures. However, an asymmetric skull that persists for longer than two to three weeks after birth, or a persistent palpable ridge along the suture line is abnormal, and might suggest craniosynostosis.

However, an asymmetric systolic-diastolic bruit that is heard over the eyeballs and anterior fontanel may indicate the presence of an arteriovenous malformation involving the vein of Galen. The bruit is best heard by using the bell of the stethoscope. Vein of Galen malformations may present with high-output cardiac failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Transillumination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transillumination of the head is performed by placing a bright light source with a dark rim on to the scalp surface in a darkened room. The normal zone of transillumination is generally 1 to 2 cm from the rim of light, and is somewhat larger over the frontal than the parieto-occipital regions. Increased transillumination suggests a fluid-filled, intracranial lesion such as hydrocephalus, hydranencephaly, or porencephalic cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spine is inspected and palpated to detect abnormalities, such as a neural tube defect. Myelomeningocele is a readily apparent neurulation defect that is most often localized to the lumbar region, and less frequently at the thoracic or cervical level.

Common normal findings during active sleep include fragmentary myoclonus that migrates from one limb to another, facial twitches, and irregular respiratory rate. Although jitteriness or tremulousness can occur in normal awake infants, sustained tremulousness beyond the fourth day of life may be a marker of cortical dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21424188\"><span class=\"h3\">Prechtl system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The quantity and quality of gross body movements in both preterm and term infants can be studied using the assessment system developed by Prechtl, based on postmenstrual age for the preterm infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].However, it requires one-hour video recordings each week, and subsequently 15 minutes every three to four weeks, which make it impractical for use in most clinical settings. At birth, infants normally demonstrate &quot;writhing&quot; movements that change to a &quot;fidgety&quot; pattern by six to nine weeks of age. These include small amplitude, circular movements of the neck, trunk, and extremities that are best observed when the baby is supine, awake, and quiet. Concurrent with neuromaturation, &quot;fidgety&quot; movements resolve by the age of 20 weeks. Absence of fidgety movements at a time when they should be normally present is predictive of major long-term neurologic sequelae. Ideally, it is recommended that there be integration of the Prechtl assessment and the traditional neurologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

When associated with weakness and absent tendon reflexes, it suggests the likelihood of a disorder of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord or the peripheral nerves or muscle (the motor unit). When hypotonia is associated with relative preservation of mobility and with tendon reflexes that are brisk or exaggerated, it is likely that hypotonia is of central nervous system (CNS) origin, such as is seen in an infant with Down syndrome. Of note, it is difficult to identify a motor abnormality in preterm infants with gestational ages (GA) below 28 to 30 weeks because of their physiologic low tone, immature posture, and motility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypotonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypotonic term infant lies supine in a frog-like position with the hips abducted and the limbs abnormally extended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

It is associated with dysfunction of the pyramidal or extrapyramidal systems. Spasticity is a form of hypertonia that accompanies pyramidal tract dysfunction. It is characterized by an abnormal lengthening-shortening reaction of the muscle that is most apparent in the distal portion of the extremities. On passive movement of the limb, a &quot;clasp knife&quot; type of resistance is felt. Rigidity is associated with increased resistance to movement throughout the range of motion at the joint. It may be proximal or distal, and has the feel of bending a &quot;lead pipe&quot; or a &quot;cog wheel&quot;. Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether the newborn hypertonia is due to spasticity or rigidity. Congenital brain anomalies and hypoxic-ischemic lesions are the most common etiologies of hypertonia.</p><p>Opisthotonus (ie, persistent arching of the neck and trunk) is caused by decreased cerebral cortical inhibition of the labyrinthine-brainstem-spinal cord motor projections that mediate extension of the trunk and proximal extremities. It is associated with moderate to severe acute bilirubin encephalopathy or a severe, diffuse disturbance of cortical function. In general hypotonia, with brisk tendon reflexes suggests CNS dysfunction, whereas hypotonia with diminished to absent tendon reflexes suggests a neuromuscular etiology.

The assessment is most useful when the reflexes are consistently absent, exaggerated, or asymmetric. As with all parts of the neurologic examination, the information should be interpreted in the context of other findings. As an example, the absence of a biceps reflex is likely not significant when the infant has a normal resting posture and symmetrical spontaneous movement.</p><p>The following tendon reflexes can be elicited in the newborn infant generally after 33 weeks gestation.

Altitudinal dissociation in the amplitude of the tendon reflexes is helpful in determining the level of a spinal cord lesion. For example, an intact jaw jerk combined with absent biceps, brachioradialis, knee, and ankle reflexes in a flaccid immobile infant suggests a cervical spinal cord lesion. Similarly, the combination of normal jaw, biceps, and supinator reflexes with an absent patellar response may indicate a thoracic or lumbar spinal cord lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following superficial reflexes can be elicited in the newborn:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal reflexes in each of the four quadrants of the abdomen are elicited by gentle stroking in an axial to peripheral direction, resulting in contraction of the abdominal wall.

This reflex is due to decreased cerebral cortical inhibition of the labyrinthine-brainstem-spinal cord pathway that subserves limb extension. ATNR that is seen as a resting posture rather than being elicited is never normal. ATNR appears at 35 weeks gestation, is well-established by one month postnatal age, and disappears by three to four months of age in a term infant, concurrent with maturation of descending inhibitory projections from the cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Galant reflex (trunk incurvation) is obtained by placing the baby in ventral suspension and then stroking the paravertebral region from the thorax to the lumbar area.

In a patient with a spinal cord lesion, there may be loss of pinprick sensation on the trunk or neck, below the level of the lesion. This is probably the one situation in the newborn where testing sensation with a pinprick provides useful information. Otherwise, testing in the newborn with pinpricks provides little useful information.</p><p>Assessment of pain is also difficult in the newborn and is discussed separately.

Several behavioral neonatal assessment tools have been developed, including the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). The NBAS includes 27 behavioral responses and 20 reflex items, and takes about 20 minutes to administer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The following two key elements from the NBAS are incorporated into the neurologic examination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolability &minus; Consolability is easiest to assess in a crying infant. A number of techniques are used to try to calm the infant within 15 seconds. They include infant sucking on a pacifier or the examiner's finger, holding, rocking, placing a hand on the infant's belly, restraining one or both arms of the infant, soothing by voice, or a combination of a soothing voice and the examiner's face approaching the infant. Infants with brain injury are more difficult to console than a normal infant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Habituation &minus; Habituation is a marker of cortical inhibitory function and measures the infant's ability to learn to diminish <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> response to repetitive stimuli. The use of repeating light or auditory stimuli are used to test for habituation. The shining of a soft light initially elicits a blinking response that diminishes in intensity over the first four to five trials, and afterwards ceases with subsequent trials. Similarly, auditory stimuli, such as hand claps, elicit a startle response to the first four or five stimuli, after which there is little to no response. The lack of habituation is compatible with cortical dysfunction, which is exemplified by the behavior of an infant with prenatal substance abuse exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The newborn neurologic examination has some limitations in its specificity and its ability to predict long-term outcome, in part due to a number of factors that can affect the results of the newborn neurologic examination.</p><p>Nevertheless, abnormal neurologic findings can be useful in guiding care and predicting outcome in the following manner:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can define the site and extent of injury, which guides the choice of further management decisions. As an example, the neurologic examination is an important component in making the diagnosis of encephalopathy and determining its severity. The severity of encephalopathy guides management decisions, including the use of therapeutic hypothermia.

The risk of cerebral palsy increases in infants with persistent hypotonia, weak cry, poor sucking, and decreased level of activity.

Hypotonia is the most commonly identified motor abnormality, and is due to a variety of neurologic and muscular disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61045 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Motor function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial nerve (CN) development varies with CA. In general, CNs I and XI are not tested in the neonates. The assessment of extraocular movements (CNs III, IV, VI) is based upon observation of spontaneous eye movements or the infant's response to the Doll's eyes test. Observation of the infant's sucking and swallowing assesses CNs V, VII, IX, X, and XII. Impaired gag reflex and decreased movement of the soft palate suggest dysfunction of CNs IX or X. Fasciculations over the tongue are seen with degeneration of the hypoglossal (CN XII) nucleus. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Cranial nerves'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflex examination provides information on the integrity of the central and peripheral nervous system, and includes evaluation of deep tendon, superficial, and developmental (also referred to as primitive) reflexes. Developmental reflexes (eg, Moro, stepping, grasp, and asymmetrical tonic neck reflex) require coordination of multiple muscles and nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68117 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66214 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74355\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74355 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75985 \">figure 9</a>). (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Reflexes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory &minus; Sensory assessment is not generally performed as part of neonatal neurologic examination because it is difficult to accurately determine an infant's response to sensory stimuli. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Sensory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral &minus; Evaluation of neonatal behavior, including consolability and habituation, assesses higher cortical functions.
