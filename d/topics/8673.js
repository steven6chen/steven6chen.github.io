The need for a multimodality imaging, team-based approach throughout the continuum of the care of TAVI patients makes this procedure unique for patients with aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Preprocedural planning, intraprocedural implantation guidance, and long-term follow-up of patients undergoing TAVI require the expert use of multiple imaging modalities, each with its own strengths and limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Multimodality imaging is an important aspect of each of these steps such that a team of skilled and knowledgeable cardiologists and radiologists able to perform and interpret a variety of imaging techniques are an important part of the care team for patients undergoing TAVI.</p><p>This topic will discuss how clinicians derive multimodality imaging information and integrate it into the decision-making process for patient care during the preprocedural, intraprocedural, and long-term follow-up assessments for TAVI using both balloon-expandable (eg, Sapien 3) and self-expanding (eg, Medtronic CoreValve) transcatheter heart valves (THVs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109286 \">figure 1</a>).

The sequence and timing of these steps will depend on whether any previous imaging is available, the likelihood of TAVI versus aortic valve surgery, and renal function.

The TTE will generally demonstrate severity and provide an initial assessment of aortic valve morphology, identify any concomitant valve lesions such as mitral regurgitation (MR), assess left and right ventricular function, and provide an estimate of pulmonary artery pressure. An approximation of aortic annular and sinus dimensions can also be obtained, although in current practice two-dimensional TTE plays a limited role in annular sizing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is performed as needed, with optional three-dimensional imaging to assess the aortic root as dictated by local practice. There is growing utilization of three-dimensional TEE for annular sizing, particularly in patients with contraindications to computed tomography (CT) such as renal dysfunction and known iodinated contrast allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic cardiac catheterization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coronary angiography is generally performed to assess for coronary artery disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Invasive transaortic pressure gradient measurement to assess severity of aortic stenosis is not generally required (and entails added risk) but is indicated if noninvasive data are nondiagnostic or if there is a discrepancy between the echocardiogram and clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Continuous quality improvement approaches to increase echocardiographic data accuracy and reliability have been shown to decrease the proportion of patients referred for invasive valvular hemodynamic assessment from 47 to 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At some institutions, aortography and peripheral angiography are performed at the time of cardiac catheterization since invasive angiography provides information complimentary to that from the CT angiogram.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography is considered essential for preprocedural planning to assess the aortic root (including aortic annulus and sinus dimensions), descending aorta, and iliofemoral vascular system. MDCT assessment of the annular dimensions has gained near universal acceptance as the standard of care as there is evidence suggesting that MDCT favorably influences clinical decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/4,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-12</a>] enabling clinical outcome optimization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659676\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining eligibility for peripheral vascular access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preprocedural assessment of the iliofemoral system and descending aorta, generally by MDCT with optional invasive angiography, enables detection of significant occlusive or aneurysmal disease of the proposed access site or catheter route. This assessment is undertaken to reduce the risk of complications related to vascular access with TAVI,<strong> </strong>with published rates ranging from 6.3 to 30.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In the operable high-risk (cohort A) and inoperable (cohort B) cohorts of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve (PARTNER) randomized controlled trial, major vascular complications occurred in 15.3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], with more contemporary data suggesting a lower rate of major vascular complications (7.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These rates are influenced by various clinical factors: sex (higher risk among women), screening protocols, and the diameter of the arterial sheaths used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

A standardized approach includes three-dimensional volume-rendered imaging, curved multiplanar reformats, and maximum intensity projection images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Incorporation of this approach into preprocedural screening, along with use of smaller sheaths and use of percutaneous vascular repair techniques, was associated with reduction in the risk of TAVI-associated vascular complications over time.</p><p>MDCT imaging identifies patients with unfavorable vasculature, which may impact the decision to use an alternative vascular approach (ie, transapical, transaxillary, or direct aortic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Multiple luminal measurements orthogonal to the vessel (rather than in a transverse axial plane) enable evaluation of vessel size, degree of calcification, minimal luminal diameter, plaque burden, and vessel tortuosity, and also identify high-risk features, including dissections and complex atheroma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98242\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98242 \">image 1</a>). In a prospective study of 130 patients undergoing TAVI, a sheath to femoral artery ratio (SFAR) of 1.05 or higher predicted vascular complications, as well as 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the SFAR has subsequently undergone reappraisal with the thinking being that the historical value of 1.05 was too conservative, yielding high sensitivity but poor specificity, and 1.12 may be more appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although minimal vessel diameters have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], the optimal vessel diameter is likely to be a moving target as sheath size diminishes. Protocols have been published that employ direct power injection of diluted contrast in the infrarenal aorta to help reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3958812534\"><span class=\"h3\">Conventional angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the preprocedural evaluation of patients for TAVI was traditionally begun with conventional angiography, many operators now rely solely on CT for evaluation of peripheral access.

The location and timing of measurement are important given variations in dimensions along the aortic root as well as fluctuations during the cardiac cycle.</p><p>The aortic root complex has been described as being composed of three elliptical rings and one crown-like ring: the virtual basal annulus, the anatomic annulus, the STJ, and a crown-like ring demarcated by the hinges of the leaflets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98243\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98243 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. From caudal to cranial, the virtual basal ring is what is measured routinely as the &quot;aortic annulus&quot; in all imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. This ring is defined by the basal attachment points (&quot;basal hinge points&quot;) of the aortic valve cusps within the LVOT. Next, the anatomic annulus is located where the muscular arterial aortic root joins the muscular interventricular septum anteriorly and the fibrous skeleton of the mitral valve apparatus posteriorly and leftward. The highest ring, the STJ, lies above the level of the sinuses of Valsalva and is the outlet of the aortic root into the ascending aorta. The crown-like ring structure is created by the shape of the aortic leaflets attached throughout the length of the aortic root. The leaflets and rings together form a three-dimensional, oval-shaped, three-pronged coronet, with three anchor points at the nadir of each aortic cusp.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659719\"><span class=\"h3\">Relevance of transcatheter heart valve characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) characteristics should also be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109286 \">figure 1</a>). The height of the valve prosthesis and the aspect of the prosthesis that is covered by fabric (the &quot;skirt&quot;) impact device selection and placement. Specific valve characteristics are important because incorrect valve placement may interfere with coronary flow and future coronary access as well as increase the likelihood of significant paravalvular regurgitation. In addition, longer devices that extend deeper into the LVOT are more likely to result in heart block and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659726\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic annulus measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate aortic annulus measurement is critical for the success of TAVI because this size determines the size of the THV that should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. Inaccurate sizing has been consistently shown to be the most common cause of paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. THV size choice based on aortic annulus perimeter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or cross-sectional area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] is superior to annulus diameter for reducing the likelihood of postimplantation PAR. CT measurements guiding size selection of the Medtronic CoreValve were felt to be an important factor in minimizing PAR rates in the United States Pivotal Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>]. Subsequently, CT was used in the intermediate risk PARTNER 3 trial, which had the lowest rate of greater than mild PAR of any large scale trial to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659740\"><span class=\"h3\">Multidetector computed tomography scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-procedural sizing of the annulus is now largely performed using MDCT-determined annular area and perimeter measures. These measurements of the annulus have been shown to be highly reproducible and allow for a deeper understanding of annular geometry over two-dimensional measurements of the annulus. The goals of current CT sizing algorithms aim for prespecified degrees of annular oversizing such that the THV is larger than native aortic annulus. The degree and extent of &quot;oversizing&quot; depends on the structural design of the THV and the measurement used. Self-expandable devices require greater oversizing to mitigate the risk of paravalvular regurgitation than balloon-expandable devices. In contrast, severe oversizing with balloon-expandable devices increases the risk of annular injury. In addition, 10 percent perimeter oversizing does not translate to the same percentage area oversizing but is in fact closer to 20 percent area oversizing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Current MDCT systems allow imaging of the aortic root with sufficiently minimal slice thickness (0.5 to 0.75 mm) to allow for oblique reconstruction without degradation of spatial resolution (0.5 mm in-plane and 0.5 mm through plane). Measurements are taken from systolic phase reconstructions of retrospective electrocardiographic gated images, using the phase with the maximum valve opening, as is performed in echocardiography. Typically, the annular size is largest in a late systolic phase with the best image quality. Identifying an accurate deployment coplanar fluoroscopic angulation (ie, the &quot;3-coronary-sinus-alignment&quot; plane) with MDCT a priori can help reduce the need for contrast dye injection during TAVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The general sizing principle for all valves is that a three-dimensional reconstruction of the annular plane is essential. For balloon-expandable valves that are circular after deployment, area-based measurements are most commonly used. The reasons for this are multiple fold. To start, area measurements have been shown to be highly reproducible across workstation platforms, unlike perimeter measurements, which rely on smoothing algorithms that are not available across all workstations. In addition, since aortic annuli are commonly elliptical, area-based measurements will yield more conservative sizing recommendations than perimeter measurements, which is prudent given the risk of annular injury with extreme annular oversizing with balloon-expandable valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For self-expanding valves where PAR is the greater risk and rupture is less of a concern, perimeter-based sizing is more commonly used. Either way, a principle of selecting a transcatheter valve that is somewhat larger than the native annulus is established, but the extent of &quot;oversizing,&quot; the so-called &quot;sizing ratio,&quot; will differ between specific technologies.</p><p>Oversizing the THV based on MDCT measurements reduces the risk of paravalvular regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. All transcatheter valves come in a range of sizes to account for a range of annular sizes, and these differ considerably between valves. Newer, MDCT-based approaches that employ three-dimensionally-derived, cross-sectional measurements of the aortic annulus affect device sizing and patient selection and reduce PAR for the SAPIEN THV and Medtronic CoreValve, compared with traditional, two-dimensional TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/3,9,13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,13,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2856531099\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiographic measurements of the aortic annulus for selecting THV size have traditionally used the maximal diameter from a two-dimensional, parasternal, long-axis image (ie, a sagittal plane image) on TTE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98244\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98244 \">image 2</a>) or a midesophageal long-axis TEE image between 120 and 140 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98246\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98246 \">image 3</a>). Care must be taken to measure in the correct plane (ie, at the virtual basal ring) and not to measure too cranial into the aortic root.</p><p>Biplane imaging or three-dimensional reconstruction can be used to obtain measurements in the sagittal and coronal planes simultaneously and has become the echocardiographic gold standard for pre-implantation assessment of the aortic root. An advantage of this approach is the ability to measure both the long and short dimensions of the elliptical annulus. Using zoomed, three-dimensional datasets, two orthogonal, long-axis views of the aortic root can be extracted using multiplanar reconstruction mode. A third plane perpendicular to both of these long-axis views can be manipulated to obtain the transverse two-dimensional plane of the aortic annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Three-dimensional TEE imaging allows for precise identification of the annular plane from orthogonal, long-axis views using adjacent anatomy to accurately identify the annular plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This approach minimizes the effect of acoustic shadowing on measurement of the annulus. TEE imaging of balloon aortic valvuloplasty may help define the annular dimension in difficult cases. The use of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in the preprocedural stage is nascent, but compares favorably with MDCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659747\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac magnetic resonance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to limited availability and clinical experience with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for assessment prior to TAVI, it has generally been considered an adjunctive imaging modality for preprocedural guidance, though it is a noninvasive imaging modality free of ionizing radiation that provides detailed visualization of cardiac structures and quantitative flow measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. CMR can also provide quantitative ventricular function and myocardial tissue characterization.

Visualizing the native aortic valve in the optimal planes is crucial for the success of TAVI. With angiography, this is best achieved by using a fluoroscopic view perpendicular to the native valve, sometimes called the &quot;coplanar&quot; view.

Fluoroscopic visualization of balloon inflation and injection of contrast at the time of placement can also be helpful.</p><p>Optimal positioning of the CoreValve THV is determined by fluoroscopy prior to and during deployment. Optimal deployment is assessed by measuring the depth of the left ventricular edge of the stent frame in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) relative to the annulus of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve. The optimal implant depth for CoreValve is 4 to 6 mm below the annular plane. A larger angle between the plane of the LVOT and the plane of the ascending aorta tends to result in more severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with the CoreValve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659938\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TEE provides continuous, real-time visualization of the aortic annulus, valve, and balloon, thus aiding device placement and both prediction and immediate detection of AR as well as other life-threatening complications.</p><p>Optimal positioning of the SAPIEN valve within the LVOT and aortic root (&quot;50-50&quot; positioning) depends on accurate identification of the hinge points of the native aortic valve leaflets and their relation to the extent of the THV above and below that point. Because the hinge points are not all at the same level within the oval-shaped annulus, single-plane imaging is not optimal. TEE can be used to assess whether the delivery system, including the THV, is coaxial to the LVOT. The tips of the native leaflets provide another echocardiographic landmark necessary to make sure that the distal end of the SAPIEN stent covers the tip of native aortic valve.</p><p>For CoreValve, optimal deployment can be assessed by echocardiography, but is more often done using fluoroscopy.

Minor leaks are not associated with hemolysis and do not worsen over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]; however, there may be an association between even mild paravalvular regurgitation and excess mortality in some cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. For both types of THVs, the most important determinants of post-TAVI AR may be assessed by multimodality imaging: undersizing of the prosthesis, the extent of calcification of the valve, and the THV position in relation to the annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Studies of the SAPIEN valve showed that a low cover index (calculated as the difference between the prosthesis diameter and annulus diameter, divided by the prosthesis diameter) is also an important predictor of post-TAVI AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/29,115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,115,116</a>].</p><p>Immediately after deployment, the presence of AR can rapidly be assessed with TEE imaging in a single-plane short-axis view or biplane mode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For paravalvular regurgitation, the short-axis plane of imaging is optimally positioned just below the THV stent and skirt and just within the LVOT to avoid mistaking flow within the sinuses of Valsalva for regurgitant jets into the LV. Confirmation of the severity of AR should always be performed from multiple echocardiographic views. Standard long-axis views (120 to 140 degrees) can show AR, while deep gastric views allow imaging of the LVOT without acoustic shadowing. Imaging the entire annulus is mandatory and requires rotating 180 degrees while centered on the valve. Small regurgitant jets are commonly seen and do not require intervention as these jets typically decrease over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/114,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,117</a>].

The differential diagnosis includes general anesthesia, arrhythmias, device deployment, hemorrhage, coronary artery obstruction, pericardial tamponade, severe mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic injury or dissection, left ventricular damage or perforation, and embolization of the THV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/106,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,118</a>]. Embolization of the THV is the most frequent reason (41 percent) for emergency surgery in TAVI patients, which is easily imaged during TAVI with TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].</p><p>Findings of importance, by either TEE or fluoroscopy, include a new wall motion abnormality, large pericardial effusion, color flow signal of severe regurgitation, dissection of the ascending aorta, rupture of the annulus, and the location of the THV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Heart block has also been reported with the self-expanding THV and is thought to be due to the relatively low ventricular positioning of the THV and its proximity to the conduction pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/77,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,120</a>]. In one series, 50 percent of patients undergoing TAVI with the self-expanding THV developed a new left bundle branch block, and 32 percent required implantation of a permanent pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. This complication is usually detected by cardiac rhythm monitoring, and corresponding imaging findings such as abnormal mitral inflow patterns, atrioventricular (AV) dyssynchrony, or diastolic MR may be noted.</p><p>Symptomatic or hemodynamically significant valve thrombosis is rare, occurring in &lt;1 percent of patients undergoing TAVI. Limited evidence is available on the frequency and clinical significance of subclinical valve leaflet thrombosis. Post-implant MDCT has serendipitously identified leaflet thickening that was occult on postimplant echocardiography owing to normal gradients. Early postimplant CT have shown both symmetric and asymmetric leaflet thickening with varying degrees of leaflet restriction.

Because PAR jets travel along the natural curvature of the prosthesis-annular interface, it is often difficult to differentiate these jets from transvalvular AR, and imaging in multiple planes is necessary. The transthoracic short-axis view is usually the best view to demonstrate the true regurgitant orifice and helps to prevent the overestimation of PAR severity, which can occur when relying solely on apical views. The circumferential extent of PAR is used for grading severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98251\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98251 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The care team for patients undergoing TAVI should include cardiologists and radiologists skilled in various imaging modalities for each phase of care (ie, preprocedural, intraprocedural, and long-term follow-up). The goals and strategies of imaging combine to increase the likelihood of a successful procedure and decrease the risk of complications. (See <a href=\"#H29659662\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H241140914\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedural imaging goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals of preprocedural multimodality imaging for TAVI include ensuring patient suitability, ensuring suitability of the proposed access site, ensuring appropriate device type and size, and developing a procedural plan. (See <a href=\"#H241140914\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedural imaging goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key steps in TAVI preprocedural imaging include echocardiography for valve and aortic root assessment, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) of the aorta and iliofemoral system, and coronary angiography with optional invasive angiography of the aorta and iliofemoral system. (See <a href=\"#H459382664\" class=\"local\">'Key steps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals of imaging during the TAVI procedure include ensuring proper device selection and sizing, providing immediate assessment of transcatheter heart valve (THV) position and function, and immediate identification of complications. (See <a href=\"#H202143589\" class=\"local\">'Intraprocedural imaging goals and strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard imaging during the TAVI procedure includes fluoroscopy and angiography with or without integration with preprocedural imaging (eg, MDCT images overlaid on fluoroscopy) and intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). (See <a href=\"#H202143589\" class=\"local\">'Intraprocedural imaging goals and strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of TEE during TAVI varies across centers but has superior ability to identify real-time deployment, alignment, and complications. The trend towards local anesthesia with moderate (conscious) sedation (rather than general anesthesia) during TAVI may limit the use of TEE in these cases. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H202143589\" class=\"local\">'Intraprocedural imaging goals and strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for sudden hemodynamic compromise during TAVI implantation is broad (eg, general anesthesia, arrhythmias, device deployment, hemorrhage, coronary artery obstruction, pericardial tamponade, severe mitral regurgitation [MR], aortic injury or dissection, left ventricular damage or perforation, embolization of the THV), and TEE aids in the rapid diagnosis of many of these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H29659945\" class=\"local\">'Identifying complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals of long-term follow-up imaging following TAVI include assessment of valve hemodynamics, quantification of aortic regurgitation (AR; transvalvular, paravalvular, and total), determination of effects on left ventricular size and function, assessment of concurrent pathology, and detection of late complications. (See <a href=\"#H202143660\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up imaging goals and strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography remains the standard for long-term evaluation of prosthetic valve structure and function, as well as the effects of TAVI on myocardial function and hemodynamics. (See <a href=\"#H202143660\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up imaging goals and strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indices of effective orifice area and Doppler velocity index (DVI) and transvalvular gradients should be followed, with the important caveat that the technique of measuring the prevalvular velocity profile post-TAVI is unique. (See <a href=\"#H202144477\" class=\"local\">'Transcatheter heart valve hemodynamics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AR is common after TAVI, does not usually worsen, and should be reported as its components (transvalvular or paravalvular) as well as the total degree. (See <a href=\"#H202143789\" class=\"local\">'Aortic regurgitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AR is generally assessed semiquantitatively using echocardiography. If clinically indicated, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or MDCT can provide quantitative data on regurgitant volumes. (See <a href=\"#H202143789\" class=\"local\">'Aortic regurgitation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Holmes DR Jr, Mack MJ, Kaul S, et al. 2012 ACCF/AATS/SCAI/STS expert consensus document on transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
