Most patients respond to initial therapy, and some achieve sustained disease control either off all therapy or with low-dose maintenance therapy. There are two additional patterns of response:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent disease &ndash; After achieving disease control with treatment, some patients experience disease recurrences (flares) during or after the period of medication tapering.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistant disease &ndash; In other patients, the disease does not respond entirely to conventional initial approaches to remission induction, and other therapies must be considered after excluding alternative diagnoses.</p><p/><p>Approaches to the treatment of recurrent and resistant disease in adults with DM and PM will be reviewed here. The initial therapy of and clinical manifestations of these disorders in adults, the management of the cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis, and issues related to DM and PM in children are discussed separately.

The picture of weakness and atrophy of the quadriceps in addition to wrist and finger flexion involvement&nbsp;raises the suspicion of IBM (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis&quot;</a>).&nbsp;A repeat biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-resistant-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the initial response to glucocorticoids in the patient with dermatomyositis and polymyositis typically takes four to six weeks for normalization of creatine kinase (CK) levels, or three to four months to regain muscle strength; thus, a patient should not be classified as having resistant disease without considering these time factors.</p><p>Multiple options exist for treating patients who do not respond adequately to glucocorticoids plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Evidence of clinically significant benefit is greatest with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). We suggest using rituximab first in this setting, and then trying IVIG if rituximab fails. Additional considerations that may influence the choice of therapies include the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly if it has not responded to initial treatment measures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interstitial-lung-disease-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interstitial lung disease in dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The reasons for favoring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> over IVIG include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> has been associated with substantial improvement in dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) in patients with previously refractory disease.

It is a promising agent for the treatment of both DM and PM. A variety of dosing regimens have been employed in a randomized trial and several small case series or case reports in patients with DM and PM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-resistant-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. In rheumatic disease (particularly RA), the trend with the use of rituximab is to employ two 1 gram doses two weeks apart.</p><p>Some data indicate that patients who suffer disease flares can be retreated effectively with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, but a larger clinical experience with this agent and additional randomized trials are required before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Observations with rituximab include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in inflammatory myositis, the Rituximab in Myositis (RIM) trial, involved 195 patients, all of whom were treated with rituximab either at baseline or after an eight-week delay, including 76 patients with adult DM and PM and 48 patients with juvenile DM; all patients had disease refractory to glucocorticoids and at least one immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agent (mean of 3.1 agents in addition to the glucocorticoid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-and-resistant-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The findings suggested that rituximab is potentially effective in these populations, but no differences in response to rituximab were seen between the two groups to which the patients were allocated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> up to 1 gram, administered intravenously once weekly for two weeks) either on weeks zero and one (&quot;early arm&quot;) or on weeks eight and nine (&quot;late arm&quot;), and were assigned to receive placebo at the time point during which they did not receive rituximab. There were no differences between the early and late treatment arms in the time from baseline to achieve the composite response criteria (both at about 20 weeks) or 20 percent improvement in strength, nor were there differences between the two arms in the frequency with which the response criteria or 20 percent improvement in strength were achieved or in the rate of glucocorticoid taper. The disease groups (DM, PM, and juvenile DM) did not differ in outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite the failure to demonstrate differences based upon the eight-week treatment delay, the composite response criterion was achieved by 83 percent of the patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> during the 44-week trial, and the mean dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in the 160 patients on it at baseline was significantly reduced, from 20.8 to 14.4 mg daily. Response criteria were also met after a second course of therapy by eight of nine patients eligible for retreatment after an initial response and later recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Only one patient withdrew due to an adverse effect, although 26 serious adverse effects attributed to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> were observed, most of which were infections. These included pneumonia and cellulitis (six patients each), as well as urosepsis and herpes zoster (two patients each), and one patient each had septic arthritis, histoplasmosis, urinary tract infection, respiratory failure, heart failure, dysrhythmia, venous thrombosis, syncope, rash, and neurologic symptoms.
