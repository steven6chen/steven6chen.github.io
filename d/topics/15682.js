The glenoid is shallow, allowing for a wide range of motion, with only a small portion of the humeral head articulating with the glenoid in any position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95334 \">figure 5</a>). The glenoid labrum is a fibrocartilaginous structure that surrounds the glenoid and inserts into the edge of the joint capsule. The distal portion of the joint capsule attaches to the humeral neck. The inferior glenohumeral ligament represents the anterior-inferior portion of the capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98022 \">figure 2</a>). This ligament is thicker than the rest of the joint capsule and provides the strongest impediment to anterior dislocation.</p><p>The rotator cuff muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027 \">figure 6</a>)provide additional support of the glenohumeral joint. The subscapularis muscle lies anterior to the joint capsule and acts as a secondary support resisting dislocation. Posteriorly the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor pull the humeral head into the glenoid and help to prevent it from anterior subluxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The axillary nerve, the nerve most often injured with shoulder dislocations, runs inferiorly to the humeral head and wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus. It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles and the skin overlying the lateral shoulder (&quot;shoulder badge&quot; distribution). Shoulder anatomy is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of a shoulder dislocation need a thorough examination and frequently radiographic imaging to diagnose dislocation and associated injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior shoulder dislocation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anterior shoulder dislocation is usually caused by a blow to the abducted, externally rotated, and extended arm (eg, blocking a basketball shot). Less commonly, a blow to the posterior humerus or a fall on an outstretched arm may cause an anterior dislocation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anteriorly dislocated shoulder causes the arm to be slightly abducted and externally rotated. The patient resists all movement. The acromion appears prominent in thin individuals and there is loss of the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60699 \">picture 1</a>). Clinicians perform a neurovascular examination paying particular attention to distal pulses and the function of the axillary nerve, which is most commonly injured in anterior shoulder dislocations. Axillary nerve dysfunction manifests as loss of sensation in a &quot;shoulder badge&quot; distribution, although this finding is not reliably present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Deltoid muscle weakness may also be present, but is impractical to assess during the acute injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some degree of axillary nerve dysfunction is present in 42 percent of patients with an anterior dislocation, but most patients recover completely without intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. In many cases, dysfunction resolves with reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40111364\"><span class=\"h4\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinicians obtain radiographs before and after reduction of an anterior shoulder dislocation. Initial radiographs confirm the diagnosis and exclude fractures; postreduction radiographs confirm successful reduction and exclude any fracture caused by the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Clinically important fractures occur with approximately 25 percent of shoulder dislocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. According to a retrospective case-control study, factors associated with fracture include age over 40, first-time dislocation, and traumatic mechanism (eg, fight or fall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When all three factors were absent, the negative predictive value for the presence of a fracture was 96.6 percent (95% CI 88.3-99.6). Based upon this study and other observational data, we feel prereduction radiographs are unnecessary if none of the listed criteria are met and the clinician feels certain of the diagnosis of an anterior shoulder dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. If prereduction shoulder radiographs are obtained, look carefully for a surgical neck fracture of the humeral head. Attempts at reduction are contraindicated in this setting due to the increased likelihood of displacing the fracture and causing avascular necrosis of the humeral head.</p><p>Routine films include an anteroposterior (AP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98357\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98357 \">image 1</a>), a scapular &quot;Y&quot; view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51351\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51351 \">image 2</a>), and an axillary view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99125\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99125 \">image 3</a>). The diagnosis of an anterior shoulder dislocation may be straightforward and is often easily visualized on the AP view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81951\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81951 \">image 4</a>). The dislocated humeral head usually lies in a subcoracoid position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64651 \">figure 7</a>). If the humeral head is subclavicular or subglenoid, there has been a greater degree of displacement and a concomitant greater tuberosity fracture or rotator cuff tear is usually present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64651 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>A false dislocation of the humeral head may be seen on the AP radiograph in the setting of a proximal humerus fracture if a joint hemarthrosis pushes the humeral head inferiorly, giving the appearance of an anterior shoulder dislocation. In most cases, a false dislocation can be distinguished from a true dislocation using the axillary view (described just below).</p><p>The scapular &quot;Y&quot; view is taken with the beam directed parallel to the scapular body. The &quot;Y&quot; is formed by the body, spine, and coracoid process. The glenoid falls in the center of the &quot;Y&quot; and is normally obscured by the humeral head. When an anterior dislocation is present, the humeral head appears medial to the &quot;Y&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72538\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72538 \">image 5</a>). There may be false negatives with the scapular view, so an axillary view should also be obtained.</p><p>The axillary view is taken with the patient's arm abducted. The radiograph plate is placed on the patients shoulder and the x-ray beam projects through the axilla to the plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81658\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81658 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61746\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61746 \">image 6</a>). The patient's arm need not be abducted 90 degrees, as this position causes pain. About 10 to 15 degrees of abduction, or just enough to get the x-ray tube between the patient's arm and hip, is usually sufficient to obtain the appropriate view. Alternatively, a Velpeau axillary view can be obtained in which the patient leans back 15 degrees over the edge of a table and the beam is directed from above the shoulder to the plate placed on the edge of the table.</p><p>Another view that may be helpful in determining the presence of a dislocation is the true AP (Grashey) view in which the beam is directed at a 45 degree angle in a medial to lateral direction with the x-ray plate just posterior and parallel to the scapular body. This view helps clinicians assess for subtle joint incongruities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48306637\"><span class=\"h4\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is not routinely indicated for a shoulder dislocation. Exceptions might include instances where the exact location of the humeral head cannot be determined using plain films (eg, possible false dislocation) or when a CT angiogram is to be performed because there are signs of axillary artery injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40111376\"><span class=\"h4\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ultrasound may be less accurate at detecting potential fractures associated with anterior shoulder dislocations, preliminary observational studies suggest that it is accurate for confirming both the diagnosis and successful reduction of such dislocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated injuries (Hill-Sachs and Bankart)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Associated fractures identified on plain radiographs include Hill-Sachs deformities, Bankart lesions, and greater tuberosity fractures. A Hill-Sachs deformity is a cortical depression in the humeral head created by the glenoid rim during dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57243\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57243 \">image 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. They occur in 35 to 40 percent of anterior dislocations and are seen on the AP radiograph with the arm in internal rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bankart lesions occur when the glenoid labrum is disrupted during dislocation and a bone fragment is avulsed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54398\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54398 \">image 8</a>). Bony Bankart lesions are present in 5 percent of patients, while soft tissue Bankart lesions (no bone is avulsed) occur in approximately 90 percent of patients less than 30 years old with an anterior shoulder dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>]. Greater tuberosity fractures are present in 10 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59097\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59097 \">image 9</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Indications for orthopedic referral, including selected Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Operative treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior shoulder dislocation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism of injury &ndash; A blow to the anterior portion of the shoulder, axial loading of an adducted and internally rotated arm, or violent muscle contractions following a seizure or electrocution represent the most common causes of posterior shoulder dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination &ndash; Examination reveals prominence of the posterior shoulder with flattening anteriorly. The coracoid process appears prominent. The patient holds the arm in adduction and internal rotation and is unable to externally rotate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73358\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73358 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54900\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef54900 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies &ndash; Radiographic evidence of a posterior shoulder dislocation on a standard anteroposterior (AP) view is subtle and may go undetected in up to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Clues to the diagnosis include the &quot;light bulb&quot; sign, rim sign, and trough line sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61746\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61746 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54093\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54093 \">image 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The light bulb sign manifests because the humeral head is internally rotated and the tuberosities no longer project laterally, resulting in a circular appearance of the humeral head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54093\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54093 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rim sign refers to the distance from the medial aspect of the humeral head to the anterior glenoid rim. Although this distance may be normal with a posterior dislocation, if there is superimposition of these two structures or conversely a widened joint space (&gt;6 mm), posterior dislocation should be suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61746\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61746 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54093\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54093 \">image 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The trough line sign is present when two parallel lines of cortical bone are seen on the medial cortex of the humeral head. One line represents the medial cortex of the humeral head, while the other line represents the &quot;trough&quot; of an impaction fracture (referred to as the &quot;reverse Hill-Sachs lesion&quot;) on the anterior articular surface of the humeral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional imaging modalities that may be useful include computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound. With posterior dislocations, CT can be helpful when the presence of a dislocation cannot be determined using plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. CT is also useful for determining the size of a reverse Hill-Sachs impaction fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108211 \">image 11</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Posterior shoulder dislocation reduction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preliminary case reports suggest that ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying posterior shoulder dislocations and confirming their successful reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Further study of this promising approach is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated injuries &ndash; Posterior shoulder dislocations are commonly associated with tuberosity and surgical neck fractures of the humerus, reverse Hill-Sachs lesions, and injuries to the labrum and rotator cuff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>]. In cases where plain radiographs are indeterminate for dislocation, computed tomography is diagnostic and reveals the size of the articular surface impaction fracture, enabling the orthopedic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Inferior shoulder dislocation (luxatio erecta)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism of injury &ndash; Inferior dislocations are most commonly caused by axial loading with the arm fully abducted or forceful hyperabduction of the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This dislocation frequently occurs when patients fall and suddenly grasp on to an object above their head resulting in hyperabduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination &ndash; Patients with this injury hold the involved arm above their head and are unable to adduct the arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90272\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90272 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The forearm is pronated and in most cases rests on the top of the head. Approximately 60 percent of patients will have some degree of neurologic dysfunction, with the axillary nerve most commonly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In most cases, neurologic dysfunction resolves spontaneously following reduction. Rotator cuff tears or greater tuberosity fractures are present in 80 percent of cases. Arterial injury occurs in approximately 3 percent of patients, and can manifest as an absent or discrepant radial pulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies &ndash; Radiographs reveal the humeral head beneath the coracoid or the glenoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70882\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70882 \">image 12</a>). Associated fractures include the greater tuberosity (most common), acromion, scapula, humeral head, coracoid, and glenoid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated injuries &ndash; In addition to the fractures noted above, inferior shoulder dislocations have the highest incidence of axillary nerve (60 percent) and artery (3 percent) injuries among all types of shoulder dislocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">REDUCTION PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inform the patient of the risks specific to the agents to be used, if procedural sedation is planned. The risks of the procedure itself are minimal and include the rare incidence of fractures of the humerus, glenoid, or coracoid process. Rotator cuff injuries may also occur, but are usually present prior to reduction. Axillary artery or nerve injury may occur during reduction, especially with techniques that require a significant amount of traction, but such complications are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the reduction technique, no materials may be required. Approximately 10 to 15 pounds of weights are needed for the Stimson technique; bed sheets are used with the traction-countertraction technique. An assistant is required for many of the reduction techniques. If procedural sedation is deemed necessary, a nurse is required to prepare medications, administer oxygen, place the patient on appropriate monitors, and place an IV. Airway management equipment is moved to the bedside if procedural sedation is to be provided. One percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, a 20 mL syringe, and a 20 gauge needle are needed when intraarticular lidocaine injection is given for analgesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications and precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delays in reducing dislocated shoulders may be necessary due to the need to treat life or limb-threatening conditions.

Consultation with an orthopedic surgeon should also be obtained when a surgical neck fracture is identified concomitantly with any type of shoulder dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83568\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83568 \">image 13</a>). An attempt at closed reduction in such cases is likely to displace the fracture or worsen existing displacement, and may increase the likelihood of avascular necrosis of the humeral head. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3826998402\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia and sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduction can frequently be obtained without analgesia in patients with anterior dislocations that are recent (ie, less than 24 hours), recurrent, or relatively nontraumatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This approach is attractive because it is rapid, avoids complications from medications, and requires fewer personnel. Reduction without analgesia works best with techniques that do not require significant traction (ie, external rotation, scapular manipulation, or Milch technique) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is administered to relieve pain and to reduce spasm in the muscles of the rotator cuff.

The method employed depends on clinician preference and the patient's condition. Generally, a technique that is quick, simple, and requires neither significant force nor intravenous medication is ideal. We suggest starting with scapular manipulation, and if unsuccessful, next attempting the external rotation technique (with or without the Milch technique). If reduction is not accomplished using these approaches, then traction-countertraction or the Stimson technique can be used. The techniques are described below.</p><p>Successful reduction is heralded by a &quot;clunk&quot; as the humeral head relocates and the return of the normal contour of the shoulder. With more gradual techniques (eg, external rotation), reduction may be more subtle with no appreciable &quot;clunk&quot;.

Closed reduction is usually possible using the same techniques as adults. Nevertheless, because of the possibility of concomitant physeal (ie, growth plate) fractures, we recommend orthopedic consultation prior to any attempt at reduction, unless vascular compromise necessitates immediate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduction techniques</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scapular manipulation</strong> &ndash; Scapular manipulation is quick, easy, and well tolerated by the patient and therefore is a good first maneuver. The method employs rotation of the scapula to disengage the humeral head from the glenoid and allow it to reduce into the glenoid. Success rates range from 80 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>].

It is easiest to perform with the patient upright, but can also be performed with the patient prone if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upright technique (preferred)</strong> &ndash; Place the head of the bed at 90 degrees. Have the patient dangle their legs over the side of the gurney and rest their unaffected shoulder against the upright portion of the bed. Encourage the patient to relax their shoulder muscles. Stand behind the patient and locate the scapula. Then simultaneously push the tip medially and the acromion inferiorly using the thumbs, thereby rotating the scapula. At the same time, an assistant provides <strong>gentle</strong> forward or downward traction on the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Downward traction avoids movement of the patient's arm and may be advantageous. To exert downward traction, the assistant grabs the patient's wrist with one hand and the already flexed elbow with the other hand and pushes down on the elbow while holding the wrist in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57540 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68113\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68113 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prone technique</strong> &ndash; The arm hangs off the side of the stretcher and is allowed to drop towards the ground. About 10 to 15 pounds of weight are hung from a prefabricated wrist splint as an alternative to an assistant providing traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The scapula is manipulated in similar fashion to the upright approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>External rotation technique</strong> &ndash; The external rotation technique reduces anterior glenohumeral dislocation by overcoming spasm of the internal rotators of the humerus, unwinding the joint capsule, and enabling the external rotators of the rotator cuff to pull the humerus posteriorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. This method is safe, easy to understand and teach, has no reported complications, and requires only one clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. It is successful in 80 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>]. In one small case series, 81 percent of patients who were successfully treated required no sedation, while another observational study reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/65,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To perform the technique, the patient lies supine and the elbow is flexed to 90 degrees to relax the long head of the biceps and allow movement of the humeral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Grasp the elbow with one hand to maintain the adducted position of the arm and with the other hand hold the patient's wrist. SLOWLY, the patient is asked to let their arm fall to the side (externally rotate) as the clinician guides the hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75869\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75869 \">picture 6</a>). Whenever pain or spasm is felt, the movement is stopped and the muscles are allowed to relax. Gradually, over the course of 5 to 10 minutes, the arm externally rotates sufficiently that reduction can occur. Reduction generally happens with the arm externally rotated between 70 to 110 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Often the reduction is subtle and the &quot;clunk&quot; of the humerus rearticulating with the glenoid, typical of more forceful reduction techniques, is not appreciable. A video of the technique is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81132\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef81132 \">movie 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Milch technique</strong> &ndash; If reduction is not achieved with the external rotation approach, even after the arm is fully externally rotated, the Milch technique can be added. To perform this technique, abduct the now fully externally rotated arm into an overhead position, maintaining external rotation throughout the abduction. Reduction is achieved by applying gentle traction in line with the humerus and direct pressure over the humeral head with the clinician's thumb in the axilla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62609\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62609 \">picture 7</a>). <br/><br/>Milch surmised that in the overhead position the muscles about the shoulder were in alignment with one another, and with cross-stresses thereby eliminated, nothing would prevent reduction of the humeral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Success rates of this technique range from 86 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/42,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,72-74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stimson technique</strong> &ndash; If the above techniques are unsuccessful, one alternative method is Stimson's technique, which involves placing the patient prone and hanging the affected extremity off the edge of the bed with 10 to 15 pounds of weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76757\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76757 \">picture 8</a>). Reduction is usually achieved within 30 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traction countertraction</strong> &ndash; Traction-countertraction employs a sheet wrapped under the axilla. While one assistant provides gentle continuous traction at the wrist or elbow, the other provides countertraction with the sheet from the opposite side of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55723 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60981\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef60981 \">movie 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spaso technique</strong> &ndash; The Spaso technique employs gentle vertical traction and external rotation in the supine patient to reduce the dislocation, usually within one to two minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69081 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fares technique</strong> &ndash; In this technique, the patient lies supine on a stretcher with the affected upper extremity at their side. The clinician grasps the patient&rsquo;s wrist and gently pulls the arm to provide traction. No counter-traction is used. The arm is gradually abducted while the clinician continuously moves the arm up and down in an arc of approximately 10 cm. The up and down motion helps relax the shoulder musculature. If the shoulder has not reduced by 90 degrees of abduction, external rotation is added. A video of the technique is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83572\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef83572 \">movie 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a randomized trial, the Fares technique performed comparably to the external rotation technique (76 of 80 [95 percent] shoulders reduced versus 73 of 80 [91 percent] shoulders reduced, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cunningham technique</strong> &ndash; To perform this technique, the clinician sits in front of the patient, who assumes a comfortable sitting position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The patient places the hand on the affected side atop the clinician&rsquo;s shoulder. The clinician rests one arm gently in the patient&rsquo;s elbow crease while the other hand gently massages the patient&rsquo;s biceps, deltoid, and trapezius muscles to help them relax. While encouraging the patient to relax, the clinician instructs the patient to pull their shoulder blades together and straighten their back. This maneuver moves the scapula medially and removes the major obstacle preventing reduction of the humeral head. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Davos technique</strong> &ndash; To perform this reduction technique, the patient sits upright on a stretcher and flexes the hip and knee on the ipsilateral side of the shoulder dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108209 \">picture 11</a>). The patient then clasps the fingers of both hands together around their flexed knee, after which the clinician binds the wrists together with an elastic bandage to allow the patient to relax their fingers. Next, the clinician puts weight on the patient&rsquo;s foot (eg, sits on their foot) to hold it stationary. The patient is then instructed relax their shoulder and arm muscles and then extend their head back and let the shoulders roll forward with the arms extended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Originally described in 1993, this technique was studied retrospectively in 100 patients with a reported success rate of 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other approaches</strong> &ndash; Other methods include, the wrestling technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], chair technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], Eskimo technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], Hippocratic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], and Kocher's method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. These techniques are either more complex or associated with undesirable complications.</p><p/><p>The Hippocratic technique involves traction-countertraction with the clinician's foot placed in the patient's axilla. Kocher's method uses in-line traction of the patient's arm while it is abducted 45 degrees. While traction is maintained, the arm is externally rotated and the elbow is brought across the chest to the midline. Next, the arm is internally rotated until the patient's hand touches their shoulder. Both the Hippocratic and Kocher techniques are associated with a high rate of fractures, brachial plexus injury, and vascular injury compared with other techniques and should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior shoulder dislocation reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size of the articular surface defect (&quot;reverse Hill-Sachs deformity&quot;) and the duration of the dislocation factor into the decision whether to perform a closed reduction.

Dislocations older than three weeks are usually irreducible and attempts at closed reduction in the emergency department (ED) are often futile. Closed reduction may be performed in the operating room under general anesthesia or in the ED with procedural sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Reduction involves axial traction on the adducted arm with the elbow flexed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108210\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108210 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108060\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108060 \">movie 6</a>).

Axillary nerve injury is managed conservatively. After four weeks, an EMG and nerve conduction study is performed.

Other less common nerve injuries include damage to the brachial plexus, radial, ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves. Shoulder dislocation accounts for 7 percent of brachial plexus injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

Approximately 200 cases of axillary artery injury due to anterior shoulder dislocation have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of these injuries occur in patients over the age of 50 due to joint capsule adhesions and atherosclerosis with loss of vessel elasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. If arterial injury is suspected based on increasing upper extremity pain, a diminished pulse, or a large hematoma, emergent reduction followed by axillary angiography is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

A Bankart fracture involving a bone fragment greater than 20 percent of the area of the inferior glenoid is generally considered &ldquo;critical&rdquo; and requires urgent orthopedic referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>]. If the clinician has any doubt about the size or area of involvement of a Bankart lesion, it is best to obtain orthopedic referral. Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions are described above. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Associated injuries (Hill-Sachs and Bankart)'</a> above.) </p><p>Arthroscopic repair of a soft tissue Bankart lesion is sometimes recommended in young (less than 30), first time dislocators that engage in highly demanding physical activities because surgery reduces the high rate of subsequent redislocation in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/10,23,117-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23,117-121</a>]. Generally, repair is performed within 10 days. Late surgical indications include recurrent instability or activity limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Orthopedic referral should be obtained for significant Hill-Sachs lesions. Injuries may be managed non-operatively if the bony defect is small (&lt;20 percent of the articular surface of the humeral head) and the glenohumeral joint remains stable during desired activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intensive rehabilitation program may reduce the rate of redislocation, but this is not universally true [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/118,123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,123,124</a>]. During the initial period of immobilization (usually three weeks), the patient wears the immobilizer at all times unless bathing, mobilizing the elbow and wrist, or performing Codman's exercises (gentle shoulder range of motion exercises with the arm suspended). Abduction and external rotation must be avoided because these motions stress the anterior capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In subsequent weeks, active-assisted range of motion exercises and then isometric strengthening exercises for the muscles of internal rotation and adduction are added to the program. Generally, by week 12, limited return to sporting activities is permitted, followed by full return to sporting activities as tolerated by week 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/100,117,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,117,119</a>]. During vigorous activity, patients recovering from a shoulder dislocation may benefit from added support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100209 \">picture 14</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be taught to reduce their own shoulder dislocation by clasping their hands together around the flexed ipsilateral knee from a seated position. The patient then leans back slowly and extends the hip, pausing whenever the pain is too much, until reduction occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder (ie, glenohumeral) dislocations account for 50 percent of all major joint dislocations. Anterior dislocations comprise the large majority of these. Shoulder anatomy and mechanisms of dislocation are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior dislocation &ndash; An anteriorly dislocated shoulder causes the arm to be slightly abducted and externally rotated. The patient resists all movement and the acromion appears prominent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60699 \">picture 1</a>). Proper evaluation includes a neurovascular examination, with particular attention to distal pulses and the function of the axillary nerve, which is most commonly injured. Radiographs routinely obtained include the anteroposterior (AP), the scapular &quot;Y&quot; view, and the axillary view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81951\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81951 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72538\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72538 \">image 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anterior shoulder dislocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically important fractures occur with approximately 25 percent of anterior shoulder dislocations. Factors associated with fracture include age over 40, first-time dislocation, and traumatic mechanism (eg, fight or fall). When all three factors are absent, the negative predictive value for the presence of a fracture is generally extremely high. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anterior shoulder dislocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction technique &ndash; No clear evidence exists supporting the superiority of any one of the many methods used to reduce anterior shoulder dislocations. Techniques that are quick, simple, and require neither significant force nor intravenous medication are ideal. We therefore suggest starting with scapular manipulation, and if unsuccessful next attempting the external rotation technique (with or without the Milch technique). If reduction is not accomplished using these approaches, then traction-countertraction or an alternative technique may be used. Each technique is described in the text, along with appropriate analgesia and monitoring, and potential complications. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reduction procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobilization &ndash; We suggest that following reduction of an anterior shoulder dislocation the patient's injured arm be immobilized in a position of adduction and internal rotation. A collar and cuff, sling and swathe, or a commercially available shoulder immobilizer are equally effective. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Immobilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior dislocation &ndash; A posterior shoulder dislocation causes prominence of the posterior shoulder with flattening anteriorly. The coracoid process appears prominent. The patient holds the arm in adduction and internal rotation and is unable to externally rotate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73358\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73358 \">picture 3</a>). Posterior shoulder dislocations are commonly associated with tuberosity and surgical neck fractures. Radiographic evidence of this dislocation on a standard anteroposterior view is subtle and often missed. Clues to the diagnosis include the &quot;light bulb&quot; sign, rim sign, and trough line sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61746\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61746 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54093\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54093 \">image 10</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Posterior shoulder dislocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior dislocation &ndash; Patients with inferior shoulder dislocation hold the involved arm above their head and are unable to adduct the arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90272\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90272 \">picture 4</a>). Approximately 60 percent of patients have some neurologic dysfunction, with the axillary nerve most commonly involved. Neurologic dysfunction usually resolves spontaneously following reduction. Rotator cuff tears or greater tuberosity fractures are present in 80 percent of cases. Arterial injury occurs in approximately 3 percent of patients. Radiographs reveal the humeral head beneath the coracoid or the glenoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70882\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70882 \">image 12</a>).
