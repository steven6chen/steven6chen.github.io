Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome is present when there is obstruction due to a predominantly venous process (thrombosis or phlebitis), whereas secondary Budd-Chiari syndrome is present when there is compression or invasion of the hepatic veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inferior vena cava by a lesion that originates outside of the vein (eg, a malignancy). </p><p>This topic will review the treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Patients often die from intractable ascites with emaciation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver failure. </p><p>One study of 96 consecutive patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome found that high levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT; &ge;five times the upper limit of normal) reflected acute, severe, but potentially reversible ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The authors also noted that a slow (rather than a fast) decline in ALT levels (&lt;50 percent of starting concentration within three days) predicted a poor outcome.</p><p>With treatment, survival rates are good. In a series of 163 patients treated using a stepwise approach, survival rates at one, two, and five years were 87, 82, and 74 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Anticoagulation was given to 140 patients (86 percent) and 80 patients were managed without undergoing invasive procedures (eg, angioplasty, thrombolysis, TIPS placement, surgical shunting, or liver transplantation). Overall survival rates were 87 and 82 percent at 12 and 24 months, respectively, and transplantation-free survival rates were 77 and 68 percent, respectively. In a follow-up study that included 157 of the original patients with a median follow-up of 50 months, overall survival rates were 79 and 74 percent at three and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Transplantation-free survival rates were 67 and 64 percent, respectively. By comparison, historic series have suggested overall survival rates of 10 percent at three years without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330912371\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat predisposing conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An underlying disorder can be identified in over 80 percent of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79884 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/6,14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14-20</a>].

Patients with an underlying myeloproliferative disorder may benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> rather than anticoagulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330912089\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevent propagation of the clot</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulation should be initiated immediately in most patients to prevent propagation of the clot, provided there are no contraindications. However, the risk of anticoagulation should be considered, especially in patients who present with bleeding complications or who have varices. Prior to initiating anticoagulation, we perform an upper endoscopy to screen for varices. We only give anticoagulation to patients with a history of gastrointestinal variceal bleeding or varices who are at increased risk for bleeding (particularly in those with cirrhosis) if adequate prophylactic measures to prevent recurrent bleeding can be implemented. We prefer beta blockers over variceal ligation for prophylaxis in such patients because of the risk of bleeding from esophageal ulcers that form when the bands used for variceal ligation slough off. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H70835313\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Primary prophylaxis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We prefer to treat initially with low molecular weight heparin. In selected patients, such as those at high risk for bleeding or who have renal impairment, we will check anti-Xa activity, targeting it to between 0.5 and 0.8 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span>. We also start patients on an oral vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>). Once the international normalized ratio is between 2 and 3, we discontinue the low molecular weight heparin. Anticoagulation is continued indefinitely unless a major contraindication is present, a complication occurs, or the obstruction is due to an anatomic cause that has been corrected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H2326381811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Monitoring heparin (anti-factor Xa)'</a>.)</p><p>However, sufficient recanalization of occluded vessels or the development of adequate collateral circulation often does not occur in patients treated with anticoagulation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The use of anticoagulation as sole therapy for the Budd-Chiari syndrome is generally reserved for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome and well-compensated liver disease at the time of presentation; however, even in these patients, additional measures to decompress the liver should be considered (particularly if they are not candidates for liver transplantation) in an attempt to delay progression of the liver disease (see <a href=\"#H330911893\" class=\"local\">'Categorization'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom other types of therapy are not feasible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330912096\"><span class=\"h2\">Restore patency of thrombosed veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods available to help restore patency of thrombosed veins include thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute Budd-Chiari syndrome (usually in patients symptomatic for only a few weeks with a well-defined clot). Treatment may also include <span class=\"nowrap\">angioplasty/stenting</span> for selected patients with acute or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome with segmental hepatic vein or inferior vena cava obstruction. Treatment in patients with chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome typically focuses on decompressing the liver (TIPS placement, surgical shunts, or liver transplantation), rather than restoring the patency of thrombosed veins. (See <a href=\"#H330913355\" class=\"local\">'Decompress the liver'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330914761\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombolytic therapy is an option for treating patients with a clot that is known to be recent (less than three to four weeks old) and is well-defined on venography, provided there are no contraindications to the use of thrombolytic agents. We avoid using thrombolytic agents in patients who have an extensive clot involving the intrahepatic vena cava and hepatic veins (because of technical difficultly performing thrombolysis in such patients) or who have a clot of unknown age. </p><p>Published experience with thrombolytic agents is limited to small case series and individual reports, which have documented successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, enthusiasm for thrombolytic therapy in centers caring for a relatively large number of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome is less than the published reports indicate. In most cases, treatment has limited efficacy and exposes the patient to the risks of thrombolytic therapy, which include bleeding, stroke, and pulmonary embolism.</p><p>Thrombolytic agents have been given both systemically and locally for the treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27,28</a>]. Although no study has directly compared the efficacy of local infusion with systemic infusion, the ability to direct infusion to an affected vein could theoretically lead to a higher concentration of the thrombolytic agent and greater efficacy. The amount of medication administered during local infusion causes a comparable coagulopathy to systemic administration; thus, the bleeding risk is similar.</p><p>Thrombolytic agents should <strong>not</strong> be used in the treatment of the chronic form of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Clots in such patients have matured and are unlikely to be recanalized by thrombolytic agents. Furthermore, because such patients may have developed portal hypertension, treatment can be associated with disastrous bleeding complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330914496\"><span class=\"h3\">Angioplasty and stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologically-guided treatment, including angioplasty and stenting, can be used to treat patients with acute or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome who are symptomatic, provided a venous obstruction amenable to percutaneous angioplasty and stenting is visualized radiologically (eg, on magnetic resonance venography or percutaneous venography). These interventional procedures, along with TIPS placement, are assuming a major role in the management of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H79562250\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Budd-Chiari syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Radiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p>The anatomy of the hepatic venous circulation in some patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome may reveal a focal abnormality that is amenable to balloon angioplasty. A membranous web in the inferior vena cava, for example, can be dilated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>]. Balloon dilation of hepatic veins may also be effective in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Angioplasty can be combined with thrombolytic therapy in patients in whom there is recent thrombosis of a single hepatic vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The major problem with angioplasty for Budd-Chiari syndrome is that reocclusion of the affected vessel is common. Placement of an expandable metal stent in the occluded vessel following angioplasty may help to maintain patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/31,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35-38</a>]. Experience with this technique is limited to small numbers of patients; long-term survival with improvement in liver function and lessening of portal hypertension has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, many patients eventually require liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H330913546\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>Once inserted, the stent cannot be removed. Therefore, placement should be coordinated with a liver transplantation team in patients who would otherwise be eligible for liver transplantation. Placement of a stent above the intrahepatic inferior vena cava, for example, complicates, and in some cases precludes, anastomosis of the donor and host inferior vena cava required during liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330913355\"><span class=\"h2\">Decompress the liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIPS placement may be an option in patients with acute or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome who are symptomatic and fail to improve with other treatments. TIPS may have a role as a temporizing measure to treat complications of portal hypertension (eg, variceal bleeding) prior to liver transplantation in patients with acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Finally, TIPS placement should be considered for patients with chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome and complications of portal hypertension. Alternative treatments if TIPS placement is not feasible or is unsuccessful include surgical shunts and liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H330913528\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>However, TIPS placement may not be technically feasible because of the presence of thrombosis and because it is associated with high rates of shunt occlusion. Because of these limitations, among patients with acute or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome, we reserve TIPS placement for patients who have failed treatment with anticoagulation, thrombolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioplasty (with or without stenting). In particular, patients should be carefully evaluated to see if they are candidates for angioplasty and stenting prior to TIPS placement.</p><p>If TIPS is being used to treat complications of portal hypertension (eg, variceal bleeding) prior to liver transplantation in patients with acute liver failure, it is important that it be performed properly because failure to do so can result in complications such as portal vein thrombosis, which may greatly complicate or preclude subsequent liver transplantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330914071\"><span class=\"h3\">Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale behind TIPS placement in Budd-Chiari syndrome is to decompress congested segments in the liver by creating an alternative venous outflow tract. However, TIPS placement is not technically feasible in many patients, may only drain a small portion of the liver, and is associated with a high rate of occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The availability of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents, which have a reduced incidence of TIPS dysfunction, may enhance enthusiasm for their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several reports suggest that TIPS placement can be successfully performed in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/35,43-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,43-51</a>]. In one of the largest series (which included patients with severe Budd-Chiari syndrome who did not respond to medical therapy or attempts at achieving recanalization), overall five-year survival after TIPS placement (84 percent) was similar to five-year survival from published reports of orthotopic liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Transplant-free survival at one and five years after TIPS placement were 88 and 78 percent, respectively. A prognostic score based on age, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio levels predicted a small group of patients expected to have high mortality after TIPS, who would be better managed by liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330913528\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgical therapy for Budd-Chiari syndrome is to restore hepatic venous drainage and thereby decompress the liver. This is usually done by the creation of a surgical shunt. Surgical thrombectomy alone is usually not technically possible though it has been performed in conjunction with dorsocranial liver resection with good results in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Surgical decompression is unlikely to be beneficial in patients who have cirrhosis or biochemical evidence of advanced liver dysfunction (elevated prothrombin time and serum bilirubin level, decreased serum albumin). Such patients are best managed with liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H330913546\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>Most surgical shunts drain the portal or mesenteric venous system into the inferior vena cava or another systemic vein. This allows blood entering the liver via the hepatic artery to have a low pressure route by which to drain out of the liver. Severe acute hepatocellular necrosis caused by pressure-induced atrophy of hepatocytes will often regress following the creation of decompressive shunts.</p><p>Visceral arteriography is mandatory when planning surgery to decompress the congested liver. The hepatic arteries are usually stretched, arched, and attenuated, which may influence the surgical approach. In addition, the patency of the portal, splenic, and mesenteric veins can be determined, and tumors involving the liver, inferior vena cava, or the hepatic and portal veins can be identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330913534\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgical shunts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple surgical approaches have been attempted in the treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-59</a>]. Because of the availability of TIPS placement for the treatment of refractory portal hypertensive bleeding and the rarity of Budd-Chiari syndrome, relatively few vascular surgeons routinely perform shunt surgery for Budd-Chiari syndrome. Referral may be indicated if an experienced surgeon is unavailable.</p><p>The decision to perform shunt surgery should be coordinated with a liver transplantation team since liver transplantation may be required despite shunt surgery. The underlying cause of the thrombotic diathesis should be identified and treated prior to considering shunt surgery.</p><p>Side-to-side portacaval, splenorenal, and mesocaval shunts all are feasible only if the inferior vena cava is patent and without a significant pressure gradient between its infrahepatic and suprahepatic portions. It has been suggested that the infrahepatic pressure in the inferior vena cava should be at least 10 mmHg lower than the portal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A simple and direct side-to-side portacaval anastomosis may also be technically difficult in the presence of caudate lobe hypertrophy. Such patients often require a mesocaval shunt.</p><p>Synthetic shunts can be constructed from the portal-mesenteric system to the right atrium (meso-atrial shunt), which can bypass the inferior vena cava if it is occluded or there is a significant pressure gradient. However, shunts that require artificial graft material are more likely to be complicated by thrombosis. To overcome this complication, one group has tried the placement of a side-to-side portacaval shunt combined with a cavoatrial shunt through a Gore-Tex graft and has reported long-term patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Five-year survival following shunt surgery depends on the extent of liver damage prior to surgery and the continued patency of the shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/59,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61</a>]. Five-year survival rates as high as 90 percent have been reported in patients who underwent shunt surgery prior to the development of cirrhosis, and whose shunts remained patent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/7,59,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,59,61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330913540\"><span class=\"h4\">Perioperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate perioperative management of patients undergoing surgical decompression is critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Maintenance of shunt patency often requires anticoagulation. In addition, Doppler ultrasound should be performed periodically to evaluate shunt patency, particularly for shunts in which a synthetic graft has been used.</p><p>Clinical or biochemical deterioration in patients following shunt surgery should be investigated by angiography to determine whether the shunt has thrombosed, which may be corrected by angioplasty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330913546\"><span class=\"h4\">Liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver transplantation may be the only option for patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome who are not candidates for or fail other treatments, or patients who have decompensated cirrhosis. Patients who developed Budd-Chiari syndrome as a result of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin III deficiency may also be cured of their clotting tendency by liver transplantation since the transplanted liver produces normal amounts of these enzymes.

Manifestations of portal hypertension include ascites and variceal bleeding. Many patients will require a dietary sodium restriction, diuretics, and possibly paracentesis to control ascites. The management of the complications of portal hypertension is discussed elsewhere.

In addition to standard laboratory studies (liver transaminases, bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, complete blood count) every three months, a reasonable approach is to perform serial upper endoscopies (looking for varices) and liver biopsies annually, decreasing the interval to every two to three years if laboratory, endoscopic, and histologic findings are stable. It may be possible to decrease the frequency of liver biopsies by using noninvasive methods for detecting hepatic fibrosis (eg, ultrasound-based transient elastography) to evaluate for fibrosis or cirrhosis. Patients receiving long-term anticoagulation need close follow-up and monitoring of coagulation status, especially during invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

However, the risk of anticoagulation should be considered, especially in patients who present with bleeding complications or those who have varices. Prior to initiating anticoagulation, we perform an upper endoscopy to screen for varices. We prefer to initially treat with low molecular weight heparin. We also start patients on an oral vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>). Once the international normalized ratio is between 2 and 3, we discontinue the low molecular weight heparin. Anticoagulation is continued indefinitely unless a major contraindication is present, a complication occurs, or the obstruction is due to an anatomic cause that has been corrected.

We avoid using thrombolytic agents in patients who have an extensive clot involving the intrahepatic vena cava and hepatic veins, or in patients who have a clot of unknown age.
