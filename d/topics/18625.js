Normally, urine that the kidneys make flows to the bladder through tubes called &quot;ureters.&quot; It then flows from the bladder out of the body. (All the organs that handle urine are called the &quot;urinary tract.&quot;) In<strong> </strong>people with vesicoureteral reflux, some of the urine flows backward from the bladder through the ureters to the kidneys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82960 \">figure 1</a>). This can happen in 1 or both of the ureters.</p><p>This problem is most common in babies and young children. It often gets better or goes away as the child gets older. But it can also happen in older children and in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18619174\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vesicoureteral reflux is caused by problems with the ureters or bladder. Most of the time, people are born with these problems. But the problems might not be found until the person is an adult. Other times, people who weren't born with vesicoureteral reflux get it later in life because of different conditions that affect the urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18619189\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18619204\"><span class=\"h1\">Why would a doctor think I have vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might think you have vesicoureteral reflux for different reasons, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent urinary tract infections (or &quot;UTIs&quot;) &ndash; These infections are usually caused by bacteria in the bladder or kidneys. If you get UTIs often, your doctor might want test you for vesicoureteral reflux. If you have both conditions at the same time, infected urine could flow backwards to the kidney and cause damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal findings on an imaging test &ndash; People get imaging tests that take pictures of the inside of the body for different reasons. These tests include ultrasounds and MRIs. If some part of your urinary tract does not look normal on one of these tests, your doctor might want to test you for vesicoureteral reflux.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure &ndash; High blood pressure is very common, especially in older people and people who are overweight. It usually has nothing to do with vesicoureteral reflux, but in a few people, the 2 conditions are related. If your doctor thinks your high blood pressure is not caused by the usual problems, he or she might want to test you for vesicoureteral reflux.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney disease &ndash; Some people with kidney disease also have vesicoureteral reflux.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18619221\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vesicoureteral reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there is a test called a &quot;voiding cystourethrogram&quot; or &quot;VCUG.&quot; For this test, the doctor puts a small, flexible tube inside your bladder. Next, the doctor fills the bladder with a special fluid that shows up on X-rays. You then urinate while an X-ray is taken. X-rays taken during this test show if the urine is flowing the wrong way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18619236\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vesicoureteral reflux treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; Your doctor might want you to take antibiotics every day, but at a lower dose than if you really had an infection. These medicines can help keep you from getting a urinary tract infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Different kinds of surgery can stop the backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18619251\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-bladder-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neurogenic bladder in adults (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
