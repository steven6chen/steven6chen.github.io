The specific management of bite wounds, superficial hand infections, and deep space infections are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H168815709\" class=\"local\">'Bite wounds'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27990999\" class=\"local\">'Superficial hand infections'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27991348\" class=\"local\">'Deep infections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H986789489\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with acute hand infections are healthy and active young adults who neglect treatment for minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hand-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. More severe infections are seen in patients with impaired immune status. A focused medical history should determine the possible source of infection, history of progress of the infection, the immune status of the patient, and any relevant past medical history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain#H385410\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and examination of the adult with hand pain&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash;<strong> </strong>The onset of hand pain, any loss of hand function, fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chills, and any spontaneous drainage should be documented. Severe throbbing pain is suggestive of an abscess in a confined space. (See <a href=\"#H27991348\" class=\"local\">'Deep infections'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A rapid deterioration in general condition is suggestive of severe infections like necrotizing fasciitis. (See <a href=\"#H1281559541\" class=\"local\">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior<strong> </strong>injury &ndash; Any prior hand injury from splinters, bites, needle sticks or as a result of attempts at drainage by the patient or other clinicians should be noted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand dominance &ndash;<strong> </strong>The patient's dominant hand should be documented.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupation &ndash; The patient's occupation may increase his or her exposure to certain infectious agents. An animal handler may be prone to bite wounds that may become infected with organisms typical for the involved species (eg, <em>Pasteurella</em>). A rose gardener is at risk for infection with <em>Sporothrix</em> through the introduction of spores through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. Certain professions are more prone to chronic paronychia. As an example, dishwashers are likely to develop <em>Candida</em> infections, whereas a person employed in a tropical fish aquarium is more likely to develop a <em>Mycobacterium</em> infection after a hand injury. (See <a href=\"#H168815709\" class=\"local\">'Bite wounds'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27990999\" class=\"local\">'Superficial hand infections'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune status &ndash; Host factors that lower immune status increase the risk of significant morbidity from hand infections (eg, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease).</p><p/><p>Patients should be questioned about any similar lesions elsewhere suggesting hematogenous multifocal presentation or similar episodes in the past and whether they were ever treated for inflammatory arthropathies like rheumatoid arthritis and gout. This medical history combined with clinical examination and investigations can help with the difficult differentiation between an infectious and an inflammatory process. (See <a href=\"#H3371249739\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>On physical examination, vital signs should be taken and recorded and any fever noted. The <strong>entire </strong>upper extremity should be exposed for a systematic examination. The hand and wrist are examined for the presence of swelling, deformity, open wounds, alignment of the fingers, neurovascular status, and local tenderness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain#H384565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and examination of the adult with hand pain&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The following findings should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema may indicate the presence of cellulitis, lymphangitis, or an underlying abscess. The area of erythema should be outlined with an indelible marker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63361\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63361 \">picture 1</a>). This will allow assessment of progression or regression of the infectious process. We find it extremely valuable in patients in the early stages of necrotizing fasciitis who are not systemically ill. The rapid progression of erythema over one to two hours helps differentiate necrotizing fasciitis from cellulitis and indicates prompt surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location of any swelling can provide clues about the anatomic location of a deep infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluctuance indicates an<strong> </strong>underlying abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73140\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73140 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discoloration of the skin overlying an abscess indicates pressure necrosis and potential impending rupture. Central skin necrosis with surrounding erythema (dermonecrosis) is a feature of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52190 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous air manifesting as crepitus can be associated with a gas-forming organism (<em>Clostridium</em>, anaerobic streptococcus, and some coliforms), but it is not always infectious in nature (eg, air gun injuries), but this should be apparent from the patient's history. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy often accompany an infection of the forearm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of all four cardinal signs of Kanavel indicate infective flexor tenosynovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hand-infections/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These four signs include fusiform swelling of an entire finger, partially flexed posture of the finger, tenderness limited to the course of the flexor tendon sheath, and disproportionate pain on passive extension of the finger. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27990955\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are systemically ill or immunocompromised, the white blood cell count may help assess the severity of infection and serve as a useful baseline for comparison to monitor the progress treatment. Other studies (eg, renal function, liver function) should be ordered based upon the patient's underlying medical conditions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1387296755\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of hand infections can be diagnosed on clinical examination based on the presence of pain, erythema, abnormal swelling, or drainage.

Radiographs may be misleading if the foreign body is radiolucent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of radiograph depends on the clinical assessment and suspected injuries, based on the physical examination and mechanism of injury. Consultation with a radiologist is helpful.

However, imaging findings may be subtle or radiographically absent in the first one to two weeks of infection. Imaging of suspected osteomyelitis is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the early phase of septic arthritis, the radiographs will show widening of the joint space and surrounding soft tissue swelling. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is useful in demonstrating joint effusion and can identify areas of bone involvement or soft tissue abscess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>If a deep abscess is suspected, an ultrasound examination should be performed for confirmation and to look for fluid collections along the tendon sheaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hand-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27991357\" class=\"local\">'Synovial space infections'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62222596\"><span class=\"h3\">Cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood and wound cultures determine the infective organism and direct specific antimicrobial treatment. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood cultures should be obtained if septic embolism is suspected (eg, patient with recurrent fever, immunocompromised patient, suspected endocarditis). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an open or draining wound, a sample of the drainage should be sent for Gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic culture. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3371249739\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of inflammatory conditions of the hand may be wrongly diagnosed as an acute infection of the hand. Some of the common conditions that mimic acute hand infections include gout, pseudogout, acute calcific tendinitis, retained foreign bodies, chemotherapeutic infiltration, pyoderma gangrenosum, metastatic tumor, and factitious illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and examination of the adult with hand pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gout &ndash; Gout is a disorder of urate metabolism that leads to high levels of uric acid and the formation of urate crystals. Urate crystals can be deposited under the skin, in joints, and within tendon sheaths as &quot;gouty tophi,&quot; which cause an intense inflammatory process. Inflamed gouty tophi may be mistaken for a felon, a subcutaneous abscess, pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74050\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74050 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27991462\" class=\"local\">'Septic arthritis'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The differentiation between gout and septic arthritis depends on the patient's history, the presence of preexisting gout, and the clinical presentation. If gout is suspected, serum uric acid values and a radiograph should be obtained. It may be difficult to differentiate between gout and infection based only on clinical examination and laboratory and radiological investigations. A trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> may help differentiate between them. Aspiration of the involved joint and examination of the aspirate under a polarizing light microscope can confirm diagnosis of gout (negatively birefringent needle-shaped intracellular monosodium urate crystals) or pseudogout (positively birefringent rhomboid shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystals). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudogout &ndash; Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition) is similar to gout except that it is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals rather than urate crystals. As with gout, differentiation from an infection depends on the patient's history, the presence of preexisting underlying diseases, and the clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;, section on 'Acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute calcific tendinitis &ndash; Acute calcific tendinitis is caused by deposition of calcium salts around the tendons and ligaments. Patients present acutely with pain, swelling, erythema, and tenderness overlying tendons or ligaments. However, other signs of infection such as fever, lymphadenopathy, or abnormal laboratory values are absent. Radiographs demonstrate characteristic homogenous calcific densities in the area of tenderness. This process is self-limiting, and patients are managed conservatively with analgesics, rest, and splintage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retained foreign bodies &ndash; Retained foreign bodies, especially wooden splinters and thorns, can provoke an inflammatory response that can mimic an infection. Radiographs may be misleading if the foreign body is radiolucent. History is valuable in diagnosis, and removal of the offending foreign body is curative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapeutic infiltration &ndash; The extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents at the site of intravenous access, usually over the dorsum of the hand, may present as marked erythema and swelling. This is frequently seen with use of vesicant chemotherapeutic agents and may be mistaken for a secondary infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extravasation injury from chemotherapy and other non-antineoplastic vesicants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyoderma gangrenosum &ndash; Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory skin disease commonly misdiagnosed as an infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-pustular-skin-lesions#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with pustular skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Pyoderma gangrenosum'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pyoderma gangrenosum usually begins as small papules that are followed by central necrosis, resulting in a central ulcer with a raised border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53733 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52528 \">picture 6</a>). The diagnosis is often associated with underlying systemic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and lymphoproliferative disorders. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic tumor &ndash; Metastatic tumors to the hand are rare and usually involve the distal phalanx; thus, they can be confused with a pulp space infection or felon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79595 \">picture 7</a>). Radiographs are useful in differentiating a tumor from infection. Primary lung tumors are the most common metastatic lesion to the hand. Other tumors that metastasize to the hand include breast, kidney, colon, thyroid, and prostate. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4202570037\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most hand infections require urgent surgical evaluation for possible surgical intervention. Necrotizing infections are true surgical emergencies. Prompt evaluation and proper treatment of hand infections can mean the difference between an excellent outcome and permanent disability. Some superficial infections of the hand may respond to nonsurgical management, particularly if it is early in their course. (See <a href=\"#H27991348\" class=\"local\">'Deep infections'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27990999\" class=\"local\">'Superficial hand infections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3751374267\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic therapy is an indispensable adjunct to surgical management. The result of culture and sensitivity testing takes two to three days. Therefore, initial antibiotic therapy is empiric based on epidemiologic clues for likely pathogen(s) as well as the Gram stain, if available. Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover skin flora (including <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and beta-hemolytic streptococci). First-generation cephalosporins provide appropriate coverage for these organisms. Issues related to coverage for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-treatment-of-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the above coverage, empiric anaerobic coverage is also warranted in the setting of bite wounds, as discussed in the following sections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H742449570\"><span class=\"h3\">Tetanus prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For hand injuries, tetanus immunization status should be reviewed and booster immunization given accordingly. Tetanus toxoid or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a> may be necessary for patients who have received fewer than three doses of tetanus toxoid or whose immunization status is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Immunization for patients with injuries'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1281559441\"><span class=\"h3\">Splinting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splint immobilization protects the affected area, limits opening of tissue planes restricting the spread of infection, and decreases pain. Splinting in a position of function can help protect against flexion contractures, reduce stiffness, and hasten rehabilitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77837 \">picture 8</a>). If a single digit is infected, a finger splint supporting the interphalangeal joints in extension is usually adequate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures#H10043308\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of finger, hand, and wrist fractures&quot;, section on 'Splinting'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1281559450\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevation helps to reduce edema by improving venous and lymphatic drainage. The goal of elevation is to keep the hand above the level of the heart so that dependent drainage can occur. To accomplish appropriate elevation, patients should be counseled to rest with the extremity above their chest using pillows or commercially available supports while sitting and lying down. The usual arm slings do <strong>not</strong> provide adequate elevation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54790 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1281559459\"><span class=\"h3\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Application of heat increases the delivery of inflammatory cells to the affected area by local vasodilatation, may enhance antibiotic delivery to the tissue, and improves patient comfort. Moist heat is more effective than dry heat. Warm soaks reach maximum vasodilatory effect in approximately 10 minutes. Short, frequent soaks are preferred over continuous immersion. For more severe infections for which soaks are inadvisable, the affected part can be wrapped in moist hot towels and then covered with plastic wrap to create a vapor barrier, with a dry towel to insulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hand-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168815709\"><span class=\"h1\">BITE WOUNDS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1281559770\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dogs are responsible for the majority of animal bites, but cat bites are responsible for the majority of bites that result in infection (76 percent). Cats have sharp teeth that inoculate bacteria deeply in the tissue. In addition, cat bites result in multiple small puncture wounds that appear innocuous at presentation. Patients present a couple of days later with infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55434\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55434 \">picture 10</a>). </p><p>The rabies immunization status of the animal should be documented (if known), and cat owners should be asked whether their cats hunt and eat wild animals. Such cats are at risk of carrying <em>Francisella tularensis</em>, which can cause tularemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to use rabies prophylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of tularemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Animal bites should be opened and irrigated as soon as possible. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bite wounds should be obtained. Patients with superficial wounds who are evaluated within a few hours of the injury can be treated under local anesthesia in the emergency department.

Prompt evaluation and proper treatment of hand infections can mean the difference between an excellent outcome and permanent disability. (See <a href=\"#H27990826\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation and management of a hand injury includes a focused history and examination, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. The area of erythema should be marked to help document progression of the infection. Empiric antibiotics should be started. Elevation and heat will provide comfort for the patient. (See <a href=\"#H3842024346\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although dogs are responsible for the vast majority of animal bites, cat bites are responsible for the majority of bites that become infected. The rabies immunization status of the animal should be documented. (See <a href=\"#H1281559770\" class=\"local\">'Animal bites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human bites are serious injuries because of the virulence of the human oral flora. A clenched fist injury, known as a &quot;fight bite,&quot; from striking another person's mouth is often missed in the emergency department because patients are reluctant to provide an accurate history and the initial wound appears innocuous. This injury pattern is very likely to result in an open metacarpal head fracture and may progress to septic arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H1281559777\" class=\"local\">'Human bites'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial hand infections arise from the skin and subcutaneous tissue in a plane superficial to the tendons. These include cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp space infections, herpetic whitlow, subcutaneous abscess, and web space abscess. As a superficial hand infection progresses, it follows the path of least resistance and may involve deeper tissue planes. (See <a href=\"#H27990999\" class=\"local\">'Superficial hand infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep hand infections are deep to the tendon sheaths and include synovial space infections, deep fascial space infections, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Although less common overall, both typical and atypical mycobacterial infections should be suspected for hand infections that are refractory to treatment (typically deep infection). Because mycobacteria are difficult to culture, a tissue biopsy is often necessary. (See <a href=\"#H27991348\" class=\"local\">'Deep infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hand infections may be mistaken for several inflammatory or other conditions of the hand. Some of these include gout, pseudogout, acute calcific tendinitis, retained foreign bodies, chemotherapeutic infiltration, pyoderma gangrenosum, and metastatic tumor. (See <a href=\"#H3371249739\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and examination of the adult with hand pain&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hand-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Tosti R, Ilyas AM.
