In a systematic review, treating benign colorectal obstructions (most due to diverticulitis) with self-expanding stents resulted in more cases of perforation (12 versus 4 percent), stent migration (20 versus 10 percent), and recurrent obstruction (14 versus 7 percent) than stenting malignant colorectal obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The preferred surgical treatment is a Hartmann's procedure with end colostomy.

Patients with Hinchey I or II diverticulitis can usually tolerate a preoperative bowel preparation. Thus, if the abscess can be resected with the colonic segment, a primary anastomosis can be performed in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H1639457907\" class=\"local\">'One-stage procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>If there are concerns about either contamination or inflammation involving the surrounding tissue (eg, with a large pelvic abscess), a primary anastomosis can be performed while protected by a diverting ostomy (eg, loop ileostomy or colostomy). Compared with an end colostomy, a protective loop ostomy is easier to reverse at a later time.

The distal resection margin is typically placed in the upper third of the rectum, where the taenia coli converge. The proximal margin is placed where the colon becomes soft and non-edematous. It is not necessary to resect all diverticula-bearing colon proximal to the intended anastomosis to prevent recurrence since diverticula in the transverse or descending colon rarely cause further symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2999988708\"><span class=\"h3\">Open versus laparoscopic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A one-stage colon resection for diverticulitis can be performed open or laparoscopically. The laparoscopic approach is preferred when feasible. Growing evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgery in this setting can be performed safely with superior short-term outcomes and comparable long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/25-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-35</a>]. </p><p>As an example, in a meta-analysis of 19 nonrandomized studies comparing 1014 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery with 1369 patients undergoing open surgery, open surgery was associated with significantly higher rates of wound infection (relative risk [RR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.25-2.78), blood transfusion (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.67-10.0), postoperative ileus (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.52-5.0), and incisional hernia (RR 3.70, 95% CI 1.56-8.33) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The rates of serious complications (eg, anastomotic leak or stricture, inadvertent enterotomy, small bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal bleeding, or abscess formation) were comparable between the groups. </p><p>In addition, three randomized trials have also been performed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Sigma trial (2009; 104 patients), laparoscopic surgery performed for Hinchey I and II diverticulitis was associated with a 15 percent reduction in major complication rates, less pain, improved quality of life, and shorter hospitalization, but a longer operating time compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

A separate economic analysis showed that the total health care costs of laparoscopic and open surgery were not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second randomized trial (2010; 113 patients) found that, compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery resulted in a significantly shorter duration of postoperative ileus (76 versus 106 hours) and length of hospital stay (five versus seven days). However, the reduction in postoperative pain was less impressive (4 versus 5 on a visual analog pain scale), perhaps because patients were blinded to the surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. At 30 months, the only remaining benefit of the laparoscopic approach was slightly improved cosmetic outcomes (9 versus 8 on a 10-point scale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

However, a greater percentage of patients treated with a primary anastomosis with diverting ileostomy underwent stoma reversal (90 versus 57 percent); and reversal of the diverting ileostomy in those patients required less operative time (73 versus 183 minutes), length of hospital stay (6 versus 9 days), and resulted in fewer serious complications (0 versus 20 percent), compared with colostomy reversals in patients treated with a Hartmann's procedure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another French trial (DIVERTI), 102 patients with Hinchey III or IV perforated diverticulitis were randomly assigned to primary anastomosis or Hartmann's procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. At 18 months, the mortality and morbidity rates were similar between the two groups, but patients who underwent primary anastomosis were much less likely to still have a stoma (4 versus 35 percent). Two-thirds of patients underwent primary anastomosis with a protective stoma and one-third without it. That decision was not randomized but made by surgeons intraoperatively. Although the morbidity rate was lower without a protective stoma, this result was likely biased, as all but one patient without a stoma had Hinchey III disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further studies are required before primary anastomosis, with or without a protective stoma, can be recommended for general use in all patients with Hinchey III or IV diverticulitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708075536\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drainage procedures include laparoscopic lavage and a classic three-stage procedure. Drainage procedures are rarely performed because they do not definitively address the underlying diverticular disease. However, they may be useful in treating septic patients who are too ill to tolerate a resectional procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1078102125\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable patients'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775892364\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic lavage and drainage were introduced as an approach to avoid laparotomy and fecal diversion in patients with complicated diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. Based upon the best available data, we do not use laparoscopic lavage in stable patients with Hinchey III or IV diverticulitis. Instead, we perform sigmoidectomy with or without a colostomy depending upon each patient's clinical condition. (See <a href=\"#H718861405\" class=\"local\">'Diffuse contamination (Hinchey III or IV)'</a> above.) </p><p>Although a 2010 systematic review of retrospective studies found a low mortality rate of 2 percent and avoidance of a permanent stoma in the majority of patients who underwent laparoscopic lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], subsequent randomized trials reported conflicting results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial (SCANDIV), 199 patients suspected of having perforated diverticulitis based upon detection of free air by abdominal computed tomography scan were randomly assigned to undergo emergency surgery with laparoscopic lavage or sigmoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Compared with sigmoidectomy, laparoscopic lavage achieved similar mortality (13.9 versus 11.5 percent) and severe morbidity rates (30.7 versus 26 percent) at 90 days. However, patients who were treated with laparoscopic lavage were more likely to require reoperation (20.3 versus 5.7 percent) for complications such as secondary peritonitis (6 versus 0 patients) or missed sigmoid cancer (4 versus 0 patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized trial (LOLA) including 90 patients with purulent perforated diverticulitis showed that laparoscopic lavage produced a higher combined major morbidity and mortality rate within 30 days compared with sigmoidectomy (39 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. At 12 months, the rates were comparable between the two groups (65 percent for lavage versus 63 percent for sigmoidectomy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial (DILALA) randomly assigned 83 patients to laparoscopic lavage or Hartmann's procedure after a laparoscopic diagnosis of purulent perforated diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. The mortality rates were similar at both 90 days (8 versus 11 percent) and one year (14 versus 15 percent); the major morbidity rates were similar at 30 (13 versus 18 percent) and 90 days (21 versus 25 percent). The reoperation rates were similar at 30 days (13 versus 17 percent). At one year, however, fewer patients required reoperation after laparoscopic lavage (28 versus 63 percent). In addition, laparoscopic lavage resulted in shorter operative time (1 versus 2.5 hours) and hospital stay (6 versus 9 days for index admission; 8 versus 14 days at one year). </p><p/><p>In all three trials, the major morbidity and mortality rates were similar between the two groups. The trials, however, reported different reoperation rates, which affected their conclusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107990 \">table 1</a>). DILALA was the only trial that favored laparoscopic lavage, largely due to lower reoperation rates.</p><p>However, reoperation rates can be affected by how they are calculated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107990 \">table 1</a>). All patients in DILALA assigned to sigmoidectomy underwent colostomy, and colostomy reversals were counted as reoperations. Thus, the reoperation rate in this trial of 63 percent at one year after sigmoidectomy was almost entirely accounted for by colostomy reversals. In contrast, only approximately one-half of patients assigned to sigmoidectomy in LOLA underwent initial colostomy, and colostomy reversals were <strong>not</strong> counted as reoperations, resulting in a reoperation rate of just 19 percent. SCANDIV only reported 90-day reoperation rates, which would not have been affected by colostomy reversals, as reversals typically occur three to six months after the initial surgery.</p><p>Short-term (30- or 90-day) reoperation rates, which by definition excluded colostomy reversals, are more comparable among the three trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107990 \">table 1</a>). After laparoscopic lavage, the short-term reoperation rates were lower in DILALA (13 percent at 30 days) than in SCANDIV (20 percent at 90 days) and LOLA (48 percent at 30 days). The lower reoperation rate after laparoscopic lavage in DILALA may be attributed to better pre-enrollment identification and exclusion of patients with fecal perforation and sigmoid carcinoma, which were the major reasons for reoperations in all three trials. In SCANDIV, patients did not undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy before randomization. In LOLA, although patients did undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy, the authors argued that patients with perforated diverticulitis often developed a phlegmon that obscured visualization of the deep pelvis. </p><p>In common practice, it is unclear how conclusively fecal perforation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sigmoid carcinoma can be excluded during the initial evaluation. Thus, sigmoidectomy remains our standard treatment for perforated diverticulitis. We only use laparoscopic lavage in select patients after excluding fecal perforation (Hinchey class IV) by diagnostic laparoscopy, and after excluding either colon cancer or ongoing colonic air leak (from perforation) by intraoperative sigmoidoscopy.</p><p>Patients who are candidates for laparoscopic lavage should be advised that a reoperation (usually sigmoidectomy) may be necessary if laparoscopic lavage fails to control the sepsis or a sigmoid carcinoma is later found. The reoperation rate is likely to increase further with longer follow-up; LOLA reported that 20 percent of patients treated with laparoscopic lavage developed recurrent diverticulitis within just the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H315075255\"><span class=\"h3\">Drainage and diversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A classic procedure for colonic perforation includes three stages: the first stage involves drainage but not resection of the diseased segment and construction of a proximal diverting stoma; the second stage involves resection of the diseased segment with a primary anastomosis under the protection of the proximal stoma; the third stage closes the proximal stoma. </p><p>This classic procedure has been largely replaced by other procedures (eg, the Hartmann's procedure) because of a higher postoperative mortality rate with the three-stage procedure (26 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. In contemporary practice, the three-stage procedure is only performed when inflammation precludes safe pelvic dissection of the colon from critical sidewall structures (eg, iliac vessels and ureters), or when the patient is unstable. Drainage and fecal diversion in these situations can serve as a temporizing measure to allow treatment of infection and inflammation before further surgery or transfer to a more experienced center.
