In a large prospective study, 2141 HIV-infected patients were followed longitudinally for seven years with annual screening for symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The risk of peripheral neuropathy was associated with aging and nucleoside analog use while sensory loss was associated with older age, nucleoside analog use, and diabetes. In ART-experienced patients, female sex, taller height, alcohol consumption, higher plasma creatinine, smoking, and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> have been identified as additional risk factors for peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/21,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29</a>]. </p><p>The role of certain antiretroviral medications is discussed below.

As an example, in a large cohort of 2515 HIV-infected patients, certain drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>, and certain protease inhibitors) were associated with the development of DSPN in the first year of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, patients who did not develop DSPN in the first year of ART had a decreased risk of developing this complication with continued drug exposure. In another cohort of 2165 patients followed for more than 3 years, incidence rates of peripheral neuropathy also declined with the initiation of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These data suggest that immune restoration, or viral suppression of HIV, lead to a decreased risk of DSPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is incompletely understood and may be multifactorial. DSPN is termed a &quot;dying-back&quot; neuropathy to reflect the pattern of distal fiber loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It involves myelinated and unmyelinated axons of all sizes; this pattern of axon loss is indistinguishable from that seen with other toxic neuropathies.</p><p>There is a paucity of virus and associated inflammation in the peripheral nerves of patients with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Although there are some case reports of HIV being cultured from peripheral nerve, it is widely accepted that almost all recovered virus is from the resident macrophages and monocytes that migrate to areas of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. HIV itself may lead to local axonal injury through two separate mechanisms, both of which appear to be triggered by envelope protein gp120 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. One indirect route is via neuronal apoptosis; the other is through direct, local toxicity mediated through activation of mitochondrial caspases. Mitochondrial DNA damage has been shown to accumulate in distal mitochondria of long axons in HIV patients with DSPN, also supporting the possibility that distal mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Likely more important, however, is the role that viral antigens play in provoking immune activation and inducing a microenvironment that is toxic to the peripheral nerve, as demonstrated by the following in vitro data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunohistochemical studies show macrophage and T cell infiltration of peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated cytokines are found in the dorsal root ganglia of HIV-infected patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy raising the possibility of a multifocal, immunologically mediated inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV gp120 activates Schwann cells via its chemokine receptor (CXCR4), leading both to neuronal apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and to production and release of tumor necrosis factor and other proinflammatory cytokines, which are directly toxic to neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection is associated with a reduction in mitochondrial DNA content and changes in morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>Not only does HIV infection result in nerve damage, but recent data suggests that reinnervation is impaired in patients with HIV infection, limiting the ability of the peripheral nervous system to heal itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many cases of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy are iatrogenic, due to intrinsic neuronal toxicities of certain antiretroviral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-49</a>].
