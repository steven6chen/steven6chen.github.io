The efficacy of treatment at achieving these goals varies substantially based on the molecular features of the cancer and extent of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75989729\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In consideration of subsequent lines of therapy for NSCLC, several disease and patient factors must be ascertained. Many of the necessary pathologic features are likely to have been previously determined from the diagnostic biopsy and, if not, may be examined in archived tissue. In cases where this is not possible, we proceed with a repeat biopsy, generally using a core needle to obtain tissue from the most accessible site of disease.</p><p>The following patient and disease features should be determined prior to initiation of subsequent therapy for NSCLC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient baseline health status</strong> <strong>and preferences </strong>&ndash; We evaluate the patient&rsquo;s performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>) prior to initiation of therapy. In general, patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (PS) of 0 to 2 are reasonable candidates for subsequent therapy, while those with higher PS may be less suitable for many options. We also obtain pretreatment labs, including comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count with differential, to establish baseline health and organ function prior to initiation of therapy. Other patient-specific issues that need to be considered include age, comorbidity, and the patient&rsquo;s concerns and preferences regarding further treatment. (See <a href=\"#H23633469\" class=\"local\">'Older and medically complicated patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tumor histology &ndash;</strong> Nonsquamous versus squamous histology determines which type of chemotherapy may be most appropriate for those in whom chemotherapy is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1071934886\" class=\"local\">'Approach based on histology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular genotype</strong> &ndash; For patients treated for nonsquamous NSCLC, molecular characterization of the tumor must be obtained. Specifically, the presence or absence of a known driver mutation for which a targeted agent exists must be confirmed. For patients without actionable mutations at the time of diagnosis, a more comprehensive gene panel should be obtained upon progression, if available, to guide clinical research options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H9880670\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Molecular testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H1978104749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Liquid biopsies'</a> and <a href=\"#H670384335\" class=\"local\">'Driver mutation present'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tumor expression of PD-L1</strong> &ndash; The level of programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression influences the choice of immunotherapy. Although immunotherapy may not be the second line of treatment for all patients, it is likely to be considered in most patients at some point in their treatment course. Therefore, we assess tumor expression of PD-L1 early in their treatment course (typically on initial evaluation rather than at relapse). (See <a href=\"#H486678630\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H670384335\" class=\"local\">'Driver mutation present'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prior treatment history</strong> &ndash; The prior treatment history is a key factor, with key information including which previous therapies a patient has received and the duration of response. The approach based on this information, along with the molecular features of the tumor, is described in the sections below. (See <a href=\"#H378213898\" class=\"local\">'No driver mutation present'</a> below and <a href=\"#H670384335\" class=\"local\">'Driver mutation present'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3417566414\" class=\"local\">'Retreatment after initial response'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extent of disease</strong> &ndash; We obtain pretreatment staging scans using contrast-enhanced diagnostic computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which will serve as a baseline by which to gauge the efficacy of subsequent treatment. Furthermore, we obtain directed imaging using either CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of involved sites when symptoms or focal findings are present. There is no clear role for positron emission tomography (PET) in following most patients at relapse as CT provides adequate assessment. The location of metastases as well as whether they are symptomatic or not will determine whether local therapy in addition to systemic therapy may be indicated.

For patients who relapse after six months, we offer retreatment with the original chemotherapy regimen.

Selection of agent is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H3101364467\" class=\"local\">'Selection of single-agent chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who already received combination chemotherapy, alternative combination regimens do not appear to improve overall survival compared with single-agent chemotherapy. In a meta-analysis that included 847 patients in six trials of second-line treatment, overall survival with combination chemotherapy was not significantly prolonged compared with single-agent therapy (median, 37 versus 35 weeks; one-year survival rate, 34 versus 32 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.08) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-subsequent-systemic-therapy-for-previously-treated-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Multiple clinical trials have compared a first-generation EGFR TKI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a>) versus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> in patients with tumors that do not harbor an <em>EGFR</em> mutation. A meta-analysis that included data from six trials that included a total of 991 patients found that progression-free survival was worse with an EGFR TKI compared with single-agent chemotherapy (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-subsequent-systemic-therapy-for-previously-treated-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H670384335\"><span class=\"h1\">DRIVER MUTATION PRESENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients whose tumors harbor a driver mutation will be treated with targeted therapy as initial therapy for advanced disease. A smaller proportion of patients are treated with chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Even these patients, however, will likely have received targeted therapy after chemotherapy as &quot;maintenance therapy&quot; until progression. For patients who have progressed on a first-line targeted agent (regardless of whether chemotherapy has previously been administered), we proceed with second-generation targeted therapy, if it exists (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osimertinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">osimertinib</a> for epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]-mutant NSCLC that has acquired the T790M mutation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceritinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceritinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alectinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alectinib</a> for anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]-positive NSCLC).</p><p>For the minority of patients with a driver mutation who were initially treated with chemotherapy and have not been exposed to a targeted agent at the time of initial progression, we treat with the appropriate first-line targeted agent, followed by a second-line targeted agent upon subsequent progression. Discussion of efficacy of targeted therapy is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-with-an-activating-mutation-in-the-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with an activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene positive non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who experience progression on first- and available second-line targeted agents, we discontinue targeted therapy and initiate chemotherapy. For those who have not received chemotherapy previously and have an adequate performance status, we generally use a platinum-based doublet, as for treatment-na&iuml;ve patients who lack a driver mutation. For those who have previously received chemotherapy, or for those who are poor candidates for combination chemotherapy, we opt for either single-agent chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Given a lack of clear benefit of immunotherapy versus single-agent chemotherapy among patients with a sensitizing mutation, either is appropriate in this setting, and a choice between them depends on patient and provider preferences, as well as consideration of toxicities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3015410404\" class=\"local\">'Docetaxel'</a> below.)</p><p>Other non-cross-resistant targeted agents are under development and may eventually offer further options.

However, the presence of comorbidities may influence choice of treatment. For example, we avoid the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> in those with diabetic neuropathy. Tools to assess the fitness of older adults for cancer treatment are discussed elsewhere.

Given limited data with this approach, however, others may reasonably opt instead to proceed with the next line of treatment. Moreover, the potential for cumulative toxicity should be taken into account if retreatment is being considered, as typically tolerance for a given regimen decreases with increased exposure.</p><p>In a retrospective study of 66 patients with response to first-line therapy, 28 patients were retreated with the same regimen upon progression and 38 were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> as the second-line regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-subsequent-systemic-therapy-for-previously-treated-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The median interval from the end of first-line chemotherapy to relapse was 5.0 months.

Defining the appropriate treatment strategy, including the possible readministration of drugs used in the adjuvant regimen and the use of non-cross-resistant regimens, has become an important issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-subsequent-systemic-therapy-for-previously-treated-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Recognizing that there are no randomized trials in this setting, our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If relapse occurs more than 12 months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or definitive chemoradiation, patients are typically managed as chemotherapy-na&#970;ve, first-line patients; thus, these patients usually receive combination regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If relapse occurs less than six months after adjuvant therapy or definitive chemoradiation, patients are generally offered the appropriate second-line therapy.

For example, a patient with a good performance status and a large burden of disease may have a window of opportunity to experience benefit from retreatment, particularly if the magnitude of response to initial treatment was large.
