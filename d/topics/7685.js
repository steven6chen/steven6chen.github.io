Genetic conditions are responsible for over 35 percent of pediatric medical conditions. In adults, disease risk for common conditions is more likely to be related to a combination of multifactorial genetic and non-genetic factors.</p><p>Targeting genetic testing appropriately and understanding the limitations and challenges of available testing approaches are crucial to the successful use of genetics in improving health and quality of life. As primary care clinicians are more frequently asked about genetic testing, they can collaborate with colleagues to assure that genetic advances are applied usefully to patient care.</p><p>This topic reviews principles of genetic testing and provides general information about the use of genetic testing to evaluate patients for inherited conditions.</p><p>Additional discussions are provided on the following topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic counseling</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics terminology</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Personalized medicine, including direct-to-consumer testing</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized medicine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genome sequencing</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disclosure of incidental findings from genetic testing</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary findings from genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF GENETIC TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4098116583\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several types of genetic testing; the appropriate test depends on the indication or presenting feature(s) and the tests available for the suspected condition(s).</p><p>These range from analysis of a single gene, a panel of genes, or the entire exome or genome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single gene analysis</strong> &ndash; As the name implies, single gene analysis involves assessment of one gene only for potentially deleterious changes. These may include point mutation(s), nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, deletions, or insertions in the coding region of the gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some cases in which a specific mutation is known (eg, factor V Leiden mutation), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be used to amplify the small region of the gene that contains the relevant sequence variant in order to determine if the mutation is present or absent. This testing is very unlikely to identify variants other than the specific mutation being evaluated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some cases, a panel of pathogenic variants will be queried, such as in the <em>CFTR</em> gene for patients being evaluated for cystic fibrosis or the <em>BRCA1</em> gene for patients being evaluated for a familial breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For other conditions, the entire coding region of the gene (or the entire gene, including <span class=\"nowrap\">non-coding/regulatory</span> regions) may be sequenced. Examples include conditions in which a large range of clinically important mutations spanning an entire gene have been reported, such as sequencing the gene for coagulation factor IX in the evaluation for hemophilia B or the <em>APC</em> gene in patients being evaluated for some forms of familial polyposis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genotyping</strong> &ndash; Genotyping involves determining the combination of alleles at a specific gene locus or base pair. This is especially important when it is necessary to determine whether an individual is heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous for a variant or variants associated with increased disease risk. A number of methods may be used, including PCR, sequencing, or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;, section on 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gene panel</strong> &ndash; Gene panels are used to assess possible alterations in a set of genes that have been implicated in a specific disease or diseases. Panels may use gene sequencing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PCR for specific mutations. These panels are especially useful when there is a strong suspicion of a genetic etiology in a patient's presentation, but the number of genes to be evaluated is larger than one or two (termed genetic heterogeneity). Hundreds of disease-specific panels have been created. Examples include panels for cardiomyopathies, various familial cancer syndromes, neurodevelopmental anomalies, hypercholesterolemia, metabolic disorders, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry-associated conditions. Like genome sequencing, this approach has the potential for identifying unexpected variants of uncertain significance (VUS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications#H22497411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Whole genome, exome, or gene panel'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carrier screening for genetic disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genome sequencing</strong> &ndash; Genome sequencing (as opposed to gene sequencing) refers to sequencing of an individual's entire exome (coding regions of all the genes) or entire genome (coding and <span class=\"nowrap\">non-coding/regulatory</span> regions of all the genes). It uses advanced sequencing techniques collectively referred to as &quot;next-generation&quot; sequencing (NGS). This approach provides sequence information about genetic variation across an individual's entire genome rather than a specific disease gene. It has the potential to provide a much wider range of findings, including findings that are unrelated to the indication for the test, termed secondary findings. Such findings can include carrier status for rare recessive diseases that may impact reproductive decision making, genetic predisposition to diseases for which there are actionable steps for reducing risk, genetic predisposition for diseases for which there are no known approaches for modifying risk, genomic variants for which the clinical significance is unknown (VUS), and potential pharmacogenetic interactions (eg, altered metabolism of a drug that increases or decreases its efficacy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary findings from genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microarrays,</strong> <strong>fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and high resolution chromosome analysis</strong> &ndash; Microarrays, FISH, and high resolution chromosome analysis are used to determine genetic changes at the level of copy number variants or at the level of an entire chromosome or chromosome segment, rather than at a single gene level. Examples include detection of aneuploidies, gene translocations, and deletions of chromosomal regions. Typical uses for these methods include prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidies, classification of hematologic malignancies, and evaluation of major unexplained congenital anomalies in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2459676638\"><span class=\"h2\">Appropriate use of genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for genetic testing, especially gene panels, are rapidly evolving, in many cases without the benefit of evidence-based support of their use. In some cases, genetic testing can provide valuable information that alters patient management <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impacts the health of family members. In other cases, however, the information from genetic testing raises more questions for the patient than it answers, sometimes at considerable expense. Some gene panels are extremely useful, but for others, many of the individual genes on the panel may not be clinically validated. Thus, care should be taken prior to sending genetic testing, and such testing should be performed when the results (positive or negative) will have implications for clarifying patient management or the risks for family members, rather than being obtained to satisfy curiosity with a plan to evaluate the significance after the results become available.</p><p>Ideally, patients should be counseled by a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, or a clinician with expertise in the genetics and logistics of testing for the specific disease prior to ordering a genetic test. (See <a href=\"#H4405759\" class=\"local\">'Coordinating testing with counseling'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment#H2145377285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Informed consent for genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Approaches among experts to the use of single gene testing versus gene panel testing or whole genome sequencing vary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some experts prefer to take a thorough family history and test for specific gene abnormalities that have been shown to affect patient management or prognosis (eg, BRCA gene testing in patients with familial breast or ovarian cancer).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinicians test more broadly using gene panels; however, evidence to support this practice is sometimes lacking. Some commercial and academic laboratories promote multigene panels that may not be clinically validated for broad use, often to the extent that it becomes difficult to obtain information only on the gene of interest.</p><p/><p>Extensive genetic testing is likely to be most helpful in cases for which several possible genetic causes are likely and for which there is no definite clinical diagnosis (eg, complex neurodevelopmental phenotype in young child). Genetic testing is least helpful in cases in which an underlying genetic cause is unlikely <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in which management is unlikely to be affected by the results of genetic testing (eg, older man with colon cancer absent a relevant family history). Interpreting variants of unknown significance is challenging and often difficult for both patient and provider. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing#H70129\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary findings from genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Definitions and classification of variants'</a>.)</p><p>When selecting a laboratory, it is important to assess how well curated specific genes mentioned on the report are (see <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Where to test/Resources for testing'</a> below). In a competitive market, the &quot;more is better&quot; philosophy may result in negative downstream consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Settings for genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing can be performed at different times during a patient's life, based on the goal of diagnosing a disease, predicting disease risk, or determining carrier status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72267\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72267 \">table 1</a>). Germline genetic testing does not need to be repeated, as long as the results are accurate, since germline DNA sequence does not change.</p><p>The following illustrate testing options at different stages of life:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preimplantation testing</strong> &ndash; Preimplantation testing is performed on embryos resulting from in vitro fertilization (IVF) for couples at high risk for genetic conditions. Identification of chromosomal abnormalities or pathogenic (disease-causing) variants allows selection of embryos to implant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prenatal screening</strong> &ndash; Prenatal screening can be done using maternal blood to analyze fetal DNA (cell-free DNA [cfDNA]) to assess for an increasing number of genetic conditions. This type of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) is primarily recommended for women at higher risk of carrying a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality or birth defect, but several professional organizations recommend that doctors discuss all screening options, including NIPS, with all pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is vital to remember that women who <strong>screen</strong> positive be offered diagnostic follow-up (eg, by amniocentesis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prenatal testing</strong> &ndash; Prenatal testing determines whether a parental variant is present in a fetus. Typically, this is used for genes that are inherited in Mendelian inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked inheritance, so each fetus has an a priori 50 percent risk of inheriting the variant. Specimens for analysis traditionally have been obtained either by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis. However, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD), which uses DNA sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma samples, is expanding the options for prenatal testing while limiting risks associated with invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The goals of prenatal counseling and testing are to provide reassurance or guide and support decisions regarding whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy with an affected fetus. Prenatal testing for a condition such as Huntington disease, which is fully penetrant, carries different implications than testing for a condition that confers an increased risk of developing the disease but not an absolute risk, such as colon cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testing in children</strong> &ndash; Genetic conditions are responsible for over 35 percent of pediatric medical conditions. Genetic testing is incorporated into pediatric care when the findings will affect the management of a child at their current age. Predictive testing for adult-onset conditions is not generally pursued until adulthood. However, due to the complex overlapping phenotypes of many pediatric genetic conditions, exome sequencing is increasingly being considered as an efficient approach for making a diagnosis, particularly when the child's health status is critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The use of whole exome sequencing is expected to increase the detection of genetic factors related to adult-onset conditions in childhood. (See <a href=\"#H4404427\" class=\"local\">'Testing children'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications#H16116036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Indications for NGS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testing in adults</strong> &ndash; Approximately 30 percent of adults with conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or heart disease have family members with the condition. In turn, approximately 10 percent of these individuals come from families in which there may be a single gene that explains the etiology. Genetic testing for adult-onset conditions serves two principal purposes: to confirm or establish a diagnosis (diagnostic testing), or to assess risk for asymptomatic patients (presymptomatic genetic testing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genetic evaluation can be a tool for identifying the most appropriate treatment strategy for certain cancers. Testing of <span class=\"nowrap\">cancer/tumor</span> tissue identifies the genetic mutations present in the tumor or the germline, and pathogenic variants in specific genes may be targetable with specific chemotherapies. Increasingly, findings from tumor genetic testing are being incorporated into criteria for germline testing. As an example, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends germline testing of <em>BRCA1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>2</em></span> for any patient in which a <em>BRCA1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>2</em></span> mutation is identified on tumor testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>It is worthwhile noting that identification of (or exclusion of) specific variants does not always alter management. Thus, it may be useful to coordinate between the individuals performing the genetic testing and those treating a specific condition.</p><p>The distinctions between diagnostic, predictive, and carrier testing are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnostic testing</strong> &ndash; Diagnostic genetic testing is used to support or exclude a specific diagnosis in a patient with an existing condition. There are thousands of conditions for which genetic testing can be offered. Most of these conditions are relatively rare and manifest shortly after birth or in childhood. Some, such as Huntington disease, do not manifest until later in life, at which time genetic testing could be performed. Key to diagnostic testing is the question of whether the result will change medical management. If it will not, the appropriateness of the test is less obvious, although testing can be performed to determine recurrence risks and to obtain information for other family members. Other examples of diagnostic testing include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic testing for Brugada syndrome, a condition that results in unexpected sudden death, can be offered to an individual with an intraventricular conduction delay or right bundle branch block. Results will determine the need for implantation of cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic therapy, and avoidance of medications that block sodium channels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic testing for hereditary forms of colon cancer can be offered to an individual with multiple intestinal or colonic polyps in order to distinguish between Lynch syndrome and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The information from this testing would facilitate decisions about surgery and allow estimation of the risks of different extracolonic manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Predictive testing</strong> &ndash; Predictive testing is a method of risk assessment for unaffected individuals who are at risk for developing conditions with a hereditable component. Knowledge of an increased risk for a particular disease may lead to changes in patient behavior or clinical interventions to decrease the risk. Management strategies to decrease risk range from increased sun protection, to enhanced screening, to risk-reducing surgery or chemoprophylaxis, with varying levels of effectiveness in improving outcomes. The value of a gene test is influenced by the penetrance of the gene (whether the presence of a gene makes it highly likely that the person will develop the related disease or phenotype) and whether there are effective prevention or early treatment strategies to impact the course of the condition. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the validity of a genetic test'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of risk reduction strategies that could be incorporated in individuals with increased genetic risk include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased monitoring, hormonal therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prophylactic surgery in women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased electrocardiographic monitoring in Brugada syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Prognosis, management, and approach to screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased surveillance and possible colectomy in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-adenomatous-polyposis-screening-and-management-of-patients-and-families\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Phlebotomy and avoidance of iron supplementation for individuals with pathogenic mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis gene <em>HFE</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carrier testing</strong> &ndash; Carrier testing is used to identify asymptomatic individuals who are heterozygous (ie, carry a pathogenic variant at one allele of a gene) for a recessive disorder (ie, a disorder that only manifests in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for a pathogenic variant, or, for X-linked disorders, in males). Carrier testing applies to both autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Carrier testing can be performed in families with a family history for a specific genetic condition, or in particular ethnic groups or populations in which pathogenic variants have a relatively high prevalence, such as Tay Sachs disease among individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carrier screening for genetic disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing the validity of a genetic test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical validity of a genetic test (ie, the ability of a genetic test to predict a disease phenotype) depends on the penetrance and expressivity of the phenotype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Penetrance</strong> &ndash; Penetrance is the likelihood of developing disease when the disease-causing mutation is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expressivity</strong> &ndash; Variable expressivity refers to phenotypic or clinical variations in the way the disease is expressed.</p><p/><p>Clinical validity can be limited by the lack of population-based data on penetrance and variable expressivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1919293997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Penetrance and expressivity'</a>.)</p><p>Genetic mutations are often initially identified from high-risk families because of their high expression (penetrance) of disease. In many cases, this practice overestimates the penetrance that later is found in studies of the general population. As an example, while high-risk families with a <em>BRCA1</em> mutation show an 85 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, population-based studies report a 57 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in individuals with mutations in the same gene who are not in a high-risk family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Cancer risk in some individuals with a <em>BRCA1</em> mutation may be further decreased as they seek more aggressive interventions such as risk-reducing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The phenotypic range of findings in patients with many other conditions has also expanded to include individuals with more subtle findings. This often occurs as more individuals that lack a family history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> classic presentations are diagnosed by genetic testing. Examples include Li Fraumeni syndrome and Fanconi anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome#H639664664\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;, section on 'Spectrum of malignancies and age at onset'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia#H3290687756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fanconi anemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>For some tests, such as mutational analysis in families with familial adenomatous polyposis, the clinical validity is very high because virtually all individuals who test positive for a mutation in the <em>APC</em> gene will develop features of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In contrast, individuals who test positive for the <em>APOE</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">e4/e4</span> genotype have approximately a 30 percent chance of developing Alzheimer's disease, and most individuals with this genotype will not develop the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Variable expressivity of the phenotype will result in a wide range of severity, age of onset, or progression of disease. As an example, some individuals with biallelic mutations in the gene for hereditary hemochromatosis, <em>HFE</em>, do not develop the complications of iron overload until much later in life, even in the absence of treatment, whereas others may develop severe iron overload at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ascertainment bias refers to a distortion in the understanding of the severity of the phenotypic effects of a gene variant because testing has been done predominantly in a proband (ie, the individual in the family who was first diagnosed with a condition based on clinical features, followed by testing), who tend to have similar clinical presentations. Ascertainment bias can alter perceptions of disease penetrance and expressivity of a condition. Initial discovery of mutations often comes from high-risk families with prominent disease impact. For example, in the original research studies, families eligible to be considered for Lynch syndrome were defined by the Amsterdam criteria that required three or more affected individuals, including two who were closely related, and one with colon cancer under the age of 50. When a population-based sample of colon cancer patients was evaluated for Lynch syndrome, however, only 13 percent of mutation carriers met these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>When providing risk information, the provider should be familiar with the literature and should base estimates of risk on studies conducted with participants that most closely match a patient's situation. In many cases for complex diseases or diseases with variable penetrance, patients will need to be presented with a potential range of risk estimates and an explanation of the reason for this range. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Management and follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical utility of a genetic test refers to the impact of the testing information on clinical care. As noted above, clinical utility depends on the availability of effective interventions to treat or reduce disease risk or disease manifestations in the index patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> related family members. As an example, while the genetic test for Huntington disease has high clinical validity, the clinical utility is limited because of few treatment or intervention options available for those who test positive. However, family members at risk for this disease may choose to undergo genetic testing to make reproductive plans or for the psychological benefit in relieving uncertainty and facilitating future planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Determining the clinical utility involves considering the severity of the disease, the options for management, and the likelihood that genetic testing will change the course of treatment. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides an <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gtesting/ACCE/acce_proj.htm#T1&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsYkKVghYmdaxGXBM1Oicad54FdFHHv8Hv09p+OvPVjfXpwJ/HeyUDXJPuz44S/OqdpgdLmHf3MZigfKhGeyZ+TU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online resource</a> with a list of questions to ask in order to assess the clinical validity and utility of a genetic test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68534 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Screening and management options for patients who have a positive genetic test have often been developed for high-risk families. The efficacy of these therapies for individuals at lower risk may be unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Genetic consultation can play an important role to assure that the highest risk individuals benefit from appropriate management, while lower risk individuals do not receive unnecessary interventions in the absence of evidence for improved outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Management and follow-up'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4405759\"><span class=\"h2\">Coordinating testing with counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, genetic testing should be coordinated with appropriate genetic counseling to help patients understand the implications of a positive or a negative result for themselves and their family members. Targeting genetic counseling to the patient is vital to the successful use of genetic testing. Health care providers should consider the need for pretest genetic counseling services before offering genetic testing. These services may include obtaining family history including a three generation family pedigree, discussing the objectives of testing, clarifying the limitations of testing, and outlining the myriad potential implications of test results, including secondary findings, variants of unknown significance, and the potential implications of findings for other family members. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary findings from genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For certain common disorders for which genetic testing is used, it may be impractical to involve a genetic counselor prior to testing. As an example, individuals with iron overload are frequently tested for mutations in the <em>HFE</em> gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Thus, practitioners who will be confronted with such testing on an ongoing basis should become familiar with and routinely apply the principles of genetic counseling as they relate to the specific disorder.</p><p>The percentage of patients who obtain a test when it is offered is referred to as test uptake. Test uptake for genetic testing may be influenced by the perceived disease likelihood, implications for health, available therapies, and ethical issues. Some patients may feel that the test is not urgent. In some cases, financial considerations and coverage by third party payers may also affect uptake. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the validity of a genetic test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial consequences of testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of ethical and psychosocial issues apply to genetic testing, including the consequences for the family, issues related to testing children who are unaffected, and concerns about genetic discrimination. Clinicians must consider the benefits and risks of genetic testing, including the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. Genetic information may have unique risks based upon the meaning attributed to the diagnosed disorder and the value of the information for family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial consequences of testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the familial nature of genetics, the psychosocial issues require not just an understanding of how the results may impact the patient, but also the implications of the results for other family members, the dynamics of the patient's family, and the family support system. Many genetics professionals use the family history intake to assess the family dynamics and to understand outside influences that impact the social support of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment#H9252694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, family dynamics may be affected by results of genetic testing. As an example, some individuals may experience a sense of relief when their genetic test for a familial mutation is negative. However, others who test negative may experience &quot;survivor guilt&quot; if other family members are found to have the mutation. As another example, some family members found not to have a gene mutation may feel alienated from affected family members with whom they no longer share the same risk status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This phenomenon has some similarities to that seen in the setting of bereavement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H11407409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Loss of attachment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4404316\"><span class=\"h2\">Disclosure to family members</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic risk raises potential ethical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> legal obligations for a physician to disclose genetic information to other at-risk family members, regardless of whether it is assessed by genetic testing or family history screening. The patient should be encouraged to inform family members of genetic risk that may affect their care. Genetic counselors include a discussion about disclosure when providing the test result, and they often provide the patient a copy of the test result or a model letter for family members to use for this purpose. If a genetic counselor is not involved in the testing process, the provider who orders the test should assume that responsibility. Most patients are willing to provide consent for such disclosure, or to readily disclose the information themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. For some, their express purpose for genetic testing is to make information available to family members. Counseling regarding disclosure to family members should be documented.</p><p>However, the rare situation in which a patient refuses to voluntarily disclose information about a genetic risk to family members raises a conflict between two competing ethical obligations: the duty to protect patient privacy and autonomy versus the duty to disclose information for the purpose of preventing future harm. Sometimes, if the primary care provider is caring for multiple members of the same family, that person is in a position to further explore reasons for the refusal and potentially help the patient understand the impact of sharing. Legal opinions vary regarding the physician's duty to warn at-risk family members about a familial genetic condition. Despite numerous guidelines and policy papers, there is no clear consensus or set of legal guidelines available in most countries. As an example, in 2017, the high court in the United Kingdom ruled on appeal that health care practitioners may be liable for failing to disclose a patient's Huntington gene carriage to offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Until such time as clear legal obligations are defined, it is important to document conversations about disclosure, and physicians should consult with medical geneticists, genetic counselors, or bioethicists in the event that patients do not provide consent to share information. It is also strongly advised that pretest counseling and consent discussions include informing the patient of the potential implications of genetic test results for their family members, and, if appropriate, these discussions should emphasize that in situations where others' lives are at risk, although maintenance of patient confidentiality is a paramount concern, the practitioner may deem that the risks to relatives of not disclosing results would outweigh any potential harm to the patient by disclosure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4404427\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing of children and adolescents raises additional issues, especially in cases when establishing a genetic diagnosis would have no immediate impact on the child's clinical care or prognosis. In such situations, it is frequently recommended that testing be postponed until the child is old enough to decide if they themselves will consent to testing and would like to undergo the test. As an example, a broad sequencing approach (exome or whole genome sequencing) may identify numerous variants of potential future clinical significance that might manifest during adulthood, but would be of no use to the patient during their youth, and the patient and family may be burdened rather than empowered by the information. This must be balanced by the greater diagnostic yield of broad sequencing approaches in some clinical situations.</p><p>A position statement by the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) addressing the issue of testing children was published in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition to discussing issues of consent and assent (ie, agreement by a person not legally able to give consent) that are specific to genetic tests, this document provides recommendations regarding a variety of issues.</p><p>We agree with the ASHG recommendations, which include the following guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents should be encouraged to defer testing until adulthood so that the individual concerned can evaluate the risks and benefits of testing, unless there is a clinical intervention appropriate for childhood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When genetic testing is indicated, initial testing should be limited to targeted gene panels or single gene testing based on the clinical presentation, and whole exome or whole genome sequencing generally should be reserved for patients for whom initial testing has been unrevealing.

Enacted in 2008, GINA prohibits discrimination by health insurers and employers on the basis of genetic information. GINA prohibits the use of genetic information to determine insurance eligibility, coverage, underwriting, or premium charges.

Once a particular mutation or variant has been identified, testing other family members is technically straightforward, and family members usually can be tested for the specific genetic alteration with close to 100 percent accuracy. Often, this strategy reduces the number of tests performed on unaffected individuals and simplifies interpretation, which in turn reduces cost and the possibility of identifying variants of uncertain significance. As an example, if multiple family members have venous thromboembolism, testing for inherited thrombophilias can be performed on the affected individual(s), allowing other family members to be tested for a single thrombophilic defect if a specific pathogenic mutation is identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency#H3485667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;, section on 'Testing of family members and genetic counseling'</a>.)</p><p>Those family members who have inherited the genetic mutation may be candidates for enhanced screening or risk reduction strategies, while those who have not inherited the alteration can be spared unnecessary procedures. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Management and follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>While it is possible to begin the genetic testing process in an unaffected individual, there is a greater chance that these results will be inconclusive. As an example, if an unaffected person does not have a pathogenic variant in a particular gene, it may be impossible to know whether there is no identifiable familial mutation or whether a familial mutation is present and undetected.</p><p>In some cases, however, the affected family members may have died or may be unable or unwilling to be tested. Genetic counseling in these situations should evaluate the optimal testing approach, facilitate family communication, and explain the limitations of genetic testing when it cannot be performed on an affected individual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment#H9252694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p>For ethical reasons, genetic testing for conditions that most commonly manifest in adults is generally not done in children and adolescents unless surveillance or a preventive intervention is effective in childhood.

This may involve technologies such as telephone and telemedicine to increase access to genetic specialists, group counseling, and non-genetics health care providers developing expertise in the role of genetic testing within their specific specialties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>As noted above, genetic counseling can be performed in the context of a genetic counseling appointment with a genetic counselor, by a primary care provider, or by a disease specialist. What is most important is that individuals ordering genetic testing are able to determine the appropriate test, address the logistic issues of test ordering, prepare patients for psychosocial outcomes and implications for family members, interpret results, and incorporate test findings into management. Collaborative service delivery models in which health care providers are working with the support of genetics specialists should also be considered as a strategy for ensuring all aspects of genetic counseling process are addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Informed consent, a tenet of patient-centered medicine, is a foundation for the voluntary nature of genetic testing. Informed consent means that the patient fully understands and agrees to the procedure. Consent involves more than just the signing of a document; consent requires discussion that includes the details of the testing and its risks, benefits, and limitations, including the sensitivity and specificity of different genetic tests. When offering genetic testing, especially to unaffected individuals, most clinicians follow language from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which encourages the patient to voluntarily exercise free power of choice, without any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These issues and other aspects of informed consent for genetic testing are discussed in more detail separately.

Testing may involve analysis of DNA, cytogenetics, or measurement of a metabolite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63290 \">table 3</a>). For some conditions, such as some thrombophilias or hemochromatosis, testing can involve analysis of clotting factors or serum iron studies, respectively, rather than direct analysis for a genetic alteration. Although these tests do not provide a molecular genetic diagnosis, they can be helpful in establishing a clinical diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-adult-patients-with-established-venous-thromboembolism-for-acquired-and-inherited-risk-factors#H618765786\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating adult patients with established venous thromboembolism for acquired and inherited risk factors&quot;, section on 'Inheritable thrombophilia panels'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H11295811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Recommended procedure for family screening for HH'</a>.)</p><p>Genetic testing for germline mutations can be conducted on virtually any tissue. Most laboratories prefer blood specimens, although cheek (buccal) swabs and saliva samples may be an option for certain types of genetic testing. Testing for acquired mutations requires the appropriate tissue (eg, tumor, bone marrow). DNA can be obtained from essentially any nucleated cell type, whereas classical cytogenetic analysis, such as karyotyping, requires dividing cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost and insurance reimbursement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Costs of genetic tests vary widely, from USD $100 to $300 for common and routine tests to over USD $4000 for large gene panels or whole genome testing involving multiple family members. The costs of analyzing the DNA have significantly decreased with the use of robotics and standardized primers. However, the costs of interpreting the results of DNA testing can still be expensive, especially if the result is not one that has been reported previously (eg, a variant of uncertain significance). Including other family members (parents or other affected individuals) to help with the interpretation or accessing complicated bioinformatic algorithms can further increase cost. Public databases are helping decrease the cost of the testing and interpretation process.</p><p>In the United States, insurance reimbursement is becoming more common for genetic testing as testing becomes a more routine part of clinical care. Coverage of genetic testing by insurance will vary depending on the type of test, whether it is being done to make a diagnosis in an affected person, or to predict risk in an unaffected individual, and on the patient's specific type of insurance coverage. In a pre-authorization letter, a clear indication of the purpose of the test and the manner in which it will change management is more effective than a vague form letter. A study that reported on findings of whole exome sequencing for 250 patients (mostly children with neurologic phenotypes, all of whom had undergone prior genetic testing) found that insurance coverage for the costs was similar to other genetic testing and provided reimbursement for the majority of tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Genetic testing (especially single gene testing) is commonplace in many countries with nationalized public healthcare systems, as are perinatal mutation screening programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Where to test/Resources for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing is available for thousands of conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Some genetic tests for common conditions, such as testing for the factor V Leiden mutation, are offered through many laboratories, while other genetic tests are more specialized and may only be available from one or two clinical laboratories. As noted above, it is important to select a testing laboratory with well-curated clinical and molecular genetic information on the genes being tested. (See <a href=\"#H2459676638\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate use of genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p>Several online resources for obtaining genetic testing are available, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic Testing Registry (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4oottyJV+tPhS7Gs3UPQx+He7Xh4E9j4nqEtGCcPjsW+wBz&amp;TOPIC_ID=2901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/</a>) &ndash; Directories of genetic clinics and laboratories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GeneReviews (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/y3+Lj0shalBW+L1ZyL4trzEAfmGCQvouTQ5LbX9C3XVSHxjYdvs2mgciTuJx4IXLQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/</a>) &ndash; Overviews and disease-specific discussions of counseling, diagnosis, and management for individuals and families with inherited disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>National Cancer Institute (<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo&amp;token=+4cBCd4hrat9fnIyIQ2cmAhcMA8/rIMDm779G5gH/EwS3To7KpWOxPPOqUBMkzFG&amp;TOPIC_ID=2901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo</a>) &ndash; Genetic components of cancer including evidence-based overview to clinical genetics (PDQ).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Human Genome Epidemiology Network (HuGE Net) (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/hugenet/default.htm&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsV7zd+6uj1AMBqE+05P35N2eP5vrH5D5NkmK5JoS50vNQpinfHuX492AtGtFFEOT3Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov/genomics/hugenet/default.htm</a>) &ndash; Epidemiology and public health aspects of genetics.</p><p/><p>Resources for genetic counseling are listed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment#H6320511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Interpretation'</a>), and disease-specific testing resources are also described in individual disease topic reviews in UpToDate.</p><p>For some rare conditions, testing is only available in a research setting. Most research laboratories are not Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and thus not authorized to provide results to the patient for the purpose of clinical decision making. Therefore, when pursuing testing through a research study, it is important to clarify with the investigator the exact testing that will be done on the sample, if and how results might become available, and the expected turnaround time.</p><p>For conditions in which genes have not yet been identified or there is a lack of evidence of an effective intervention, preservation of genetic material from the affected individual by DNA banking for future genetic testing can be a reasonable option. This involves the storage of DNA (usually blood, occasionally tissue samples) for future testing should it become desired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes of testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are typically three possible outcomes from genetic testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causative mutation is identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No mutation is identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variant of uncertain significance (VUS) is identified.</p><p/><p>Finding a causative mutation can confirm a diagnosis in the affected person. Clarification of the genetic etiology of the proband's disease may aid in planning treatment or in predicting the risks for other health problems. Identification of a mutation also allows for genetic testing to be offered to at-risk family members.</p><p>Failure to identify a mutation does not eliminate the possibility of an inherited risk. A negative result may mean that a genetic alteration still exists but cannot be identified with available technologies. Alternatively, some genetic testing has a low sensitivity for identifying genetic alterations. As an example, tests for conditions such as Marfan syndrome have only a 70 percent sensitivity, in contrast to tests for Huntington disease or the factor V Leiden mutation, which have a sensitivity greater than 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. For many conditions, only some of the contributing genetic factors have been identified. Mutations in the <em>CDKN2A</em> gene, for example, account for 20 to 40 percent of families with hereditary melanoma, suggesting that there are likely other genetic loci or factors that are contributing to risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-testing/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>In some cases, it can be difficult to determine whether a particular variant is related to risk for disease, or is merely a polymorphism or variant in the gene with no clinical implications. This may be especially true in populations that are under-represented in the reference genomes used to identify pathogenic variants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing#H70178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary findings from genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Underrepresented ethnicities'</a>.)</p><p>When a VUS is identified, risk estimates should be made on the basis of the family history, taking into account information from the laboratory report. It is also important to let the family know that most laboratories continue to research the significance of these variants, and in some cases, the variant can be reclassified at a later time. Having a plan in place to communicate and follow-up with the individual or family can be important. Additional discussion of variant classifications is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing#H70129\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary findings from genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Definitions and classification of variants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term management of patients for whom genetic testing reveals an increased risk for disease may involve more frequent screening, screening initiated at an earlier age than in the general population, counseling for lifestyle modifications, initiation of pharmacologic or surgical interventions, and management of related psychosocial issues.</p><p>Many genetic conditions are associated with multiple risks. For example, individuals with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk for multiple cancers and will need appropriate screening for cancers that may not be present in the proband. Various clinicians, including primary care providers, will play a crucial role in helping patients adhere to guidelines over the long-term and in coordinating care between multiple specialists.</p><p>Additional counseling issues may arise in patients with a positive result from genetic testing, including greater understanding of their personal disease risk, reproductive implications, and implications for other family members. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

There are several types of genetic testing, including single gene tests, genotyping, multigene panels, genomic sequencing, microarrays, and cytogenetic testing. The appropriate test depends on the indication and the tests available for that condition. Testing is often coordinated with appropriate genetic counseling in order to help patients understand the implications of a positive or a negative result for themselves and their family members. The clinical validity of a genetic test (ie, the ability of a genetic test to predict a disease phenotype) depends on the penetrance and expressivity of the phenotype, which may differ in high-risk versus low-risk populations. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Principles of genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of ethical and psychosocial issues apply to genetic testing, including the consequences for the family, issues related to testing children, and concerns about genetic discrimination. In the United States, legal protection against the use of genetic information by group health insurance plans and employers is available at the federal level through the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). Additional details are described above. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Ethical, legal, and psychosocial issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whenever possible, initial molecular genetic testing should be performed on an affected family member, with testing of unaffected family members performed subsequently so that testing of family members can be limited to the identified familial variant(s). Informed consent, a tenet of patient-centered medicine, is a foundation for the voluntary nature of genetic testing. Several online resources for obtaining genetic testing including the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4oottyJV+tPhS7Gs3UPQx+He7Xh4E9j4nqEtGCcPjsW+wBz&amp;TOPIC_ID=2901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Genetic Testing Registry</a> are provided above.
