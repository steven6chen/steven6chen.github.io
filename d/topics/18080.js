Many other cyclic antidepressants were subsequently developed, including the tricyclics <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimipramine</a>, as well as the tetracyclic antidepressant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maprotiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maprotiline</a>. These cyclic compounds became first-line treatment for depression for the next 30 years, until the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were introduced.</p><p>Clinicians use tricyclic antidepressants to treat many other psychiatric disorders besides depression, including panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bulimia nervosa, and smoking cessation. Tricyclics are used to treat a variety of chronic pain states such as chronic daily headache and neuropathy. See appropriate topic reviews.</p><p>This topic reviews the pharmacology, administration, and side effects of tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants.

These effects are thought to mediate the therapeutic benefit of cyclic antidepressants.</p><p>The tricyclic antidepressants are named after their chemical structure, which consists of a three-ring central structure plus a side chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The tetracyclic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maprotiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maprotiline</a> has a four-ring central structure plus a side chain. However, it is the nature of the side chain that is more important for their function and activity.</p><p>Tricyclics are subdivided into two categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tertiary amines have two methyl groups at the end of the side chain. The five tertiary amines available in the US are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimipramine</a>. They are generally more potent in blocking reuptake of serotonin compared with norepinephrine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary amines have one methyl group at the end of the side chain. The three secondary amines are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a>. Desipramine is the active (demethylated) metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and nortriptyline is the active (demethylated) metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>. Secondary amines are more potent in blocking reuptake of norepinephrine.</p><p/><p>The tetracyclic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maprotiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maprotiline</a> (also referred to as a heterocyclic) has a side chain identical to that of the secondary amines. Thus, it is more potent in blocking reuptake of norepinephrine.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxapine</a> has a three-ring central structure and a side chain that differs from the other tricyclics. It is a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and also blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Thus, it is the only antidepressant that has antipsychotic effects.</p><p>Clinicians often avoid using tricyclics because of their adverse side effects, and tertiary amines generally cause more side effects compared with secondary amines. In particular, tertiary tricyclics cause more anticholinergic side effects (eg, constipation or blurred vision) and are also highly sedating because of their central affects on histamine. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of tricyclics are well-described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Tricyclics are absorbed in the small intestine rapidly and nearly completely. The medication then enters the portal circulation and undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver; for most tricyclics, approximately 50 percent of the drug is metabolized in this manner. The medication then enters the systemic circulation and binds to proteins, which for most tricyclics exceeds 90 percent. It is only the free fraction that is active. Tricyclics are widely distributed throughout the body, including the brain, because they are lipophilic.</p><p>Metabolism and elimination occurs largely in the liver. The hepatic CYP isoenzymes that metabolize the tricyclics include 2D6, 1A2, 3A4, 1C19, which demethylate the side chain of tertiary amines to secondary amines and hydroxylate the central ring structure. Many of the metabolites have antidepressant activity. As an example, the demethylated metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, and the demethylated metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a> is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>.</p><p>The elimination half-life for the tricyclics and related drugs averages about 24 hours. The exception is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxapine</a>, which averages about eight hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESCRIBING CYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141518488\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several basic points to review with patients prior to prescribing these medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Clinicians should describe potential common side effects, the need to take the medication as prescribed rather than on an as-needed basis, and to expect that response or remission may not occur until four or more weeks have elapsed after a therapeutic dose has been achieved.</p><p>The most commonly prescribed tricyclics in the United States are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clomipramine</a> is commonly used in Europe. The choice of cyclic antidepressant is often based upon side-effect profiles because these medications vary in their degree of side effects. Nortriptyline and desipramine tend to be the best tolerated.</p><p>Intramuscular forms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> are available only outside of the United States, as is intravenous clomipramine. These parenteral formulations can be used for patients unable or unwilling to take oral medication, and can thus serve as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There are many other tricyclic antidepressants available outside of the United States in Europe and elsewhere. These include amitriptylinoxide, butriptyline, demexiptiline, dibenzepin, dimetacrine, dosulepin (formerly called dothiepin), imipraminoxide, iprindole, lofepramine, melitracen, metapramine, nitroxazepine, noxiptiline, pipofezine, propizepine, and quinupramine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest starting with a low dose in order to avoid side effects, and slowly increasing the dose. The initial and target doses of tricyclic antidepressants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>) can vary, depending upon factors such as body mass index, how rapidly the drug is metabolized, and tolerability of side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 2</a>). In addition to finding the right dose, which usually involves trial and error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], it is important to prescribe antidepressants for a sufficient duration (eg, 6 to 12 weeks) before determining whether the medications have sufficiently relieved symptoms. &#160;</p><p>For depressed patients, lower doses of tricyclics can be effective. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials compared low doses (100 mg per day or less of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimipramine</a>; most studies involved amitriptyline or imipramine) with placebo in 807 patients for six to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred more often with low dose tricyclics than placebo (relative risk 1.5, 96% CI 1.1-1.9), but discontinuation of treatment due to side effects occurred more often with low dose tricyclics; heterogeneity across studies was significant.</p><p>However, depressed patients who do not respond to low doses of tricyclics may benefit from higher (standard) doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Higher doses may serve to optimize serum concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Plasma levels and therapeutic response'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who recover from an acute episode of major depression generally receive maintenance treatment with the dose that successfully resolved the episode, rather than a lower dose.

These antidepressants are &quot;broad spectrum&quot; in that they interact with many neurotransmitter systems, which is the basis for both their antidepressant efficacy and their side effects. Tricyclics block muscarinic M1, histamine H1, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, and commonly cause cardiac effects, anticholinergic effects, antihistaminic effects, decreased seizure threshold, sexual dysfunction, diaphoresis, and tremor. In addition, cyclic antidepressants are dangerous in overdose. The side effects of tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants generally make them less tolerable compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other newer antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Nevertheless, many patients use cyclic antidepressants safely.</p><p>The choice of cyclic antidepressant is usually based upon side-effect profiles, which vary between the different medications. The tertiary tricyclics <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimipramine</a> generally cause more side effects than other cyclic antidepressants. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nortriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> tend to have the best over-all tolerability. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Depression itself causes somatic symptoms such as headache, constipation, and drowsiness, which is important to remember when assessing patients for side effects. Thus, clinicians should ask about physical symptoms prior to prescribing an antidepressant. This will enable the clinician to decide whether the medication has caused or exacerbated a physical symptom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Overdose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most concerning is that all of the tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants are dangerous in overdose. In contrast to the SSRIs, the cyclic antidepressants can be fatal in doses as little as 10 times the daily dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The toxicity is usually due to prolongation of the QT interval, leading to arrhythmias. Overdose of cyclic antidepressants can also cause anticholinergic toxicity and seizures. Furthermore, these medications are highly lipophilic and protein bound and are therefore not effectively removed by hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning&quot;</a>.) Thus, clinicians should avoid using cyclic antidepressants in outpatients who appear to be at high risk of intentional overdose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the cyclic antidepressants are potentially cardiotoxic and should be avoided in susceptible individuals with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>At therapeutic serum levels, tricyclic antidepressants can cause orthostatic hypotension, which is one of the most common reasons for discontinuing them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Orthostasis is most likely to occur in patients with preexisting postural hypotension, is aggravated by concurrent antihypertensive medications and dehydration, and often occurs at low tricyclic serum levels. Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors is the primary cause.</p><p>Tricyclics can also reduce heart rate variability, slow intracardiac conduction, and cause various arrhythmias including tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular premature complexes. In addition, ECG changes may occur, benign or otherwise. Tricyclics do not reduce cardiac contractility or output.</p><p>The decrease in cardiac conduction has been likened to the effects of Class 1A antiarrhythmics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, and at therapeutic levels, tricyclics have mild antiarrhythmic effects on ventricular excitability and ventricular premature beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. However, tricyclics can cause heart block in patients with preexisting conduction delay. Clinicians should avoid using these drugs in patients with underlying conduction system disease.</p><p>In patients with ischemic heart disease, tricyclics can increase cardiac work and decrease heart rate variability, possibly increasing the risk of sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients on high doses of cyclic antidepressants (300 mg or more <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> or equivalent) may also be at increased risk for sudden cardiac death even in the absence of underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, tricyclic antidepressant users have a higher risk of myocardial infarction compared with SSRI users; it is not clear whether this is due to deleterious effects of the tricyclic antidepressants themselves, protective effects of SSRIs, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>It is not clear if tricyclics at therapeutic doses cause major cardiac complications in patients with normal hearts: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an eight-year, prospective observational study of adults with no known history of cardiovascular disease (n = 14,784, including 324 treated with tricyclics), several outcomes were evaluated after controlling for confounding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressant inhibits reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, which increases the amount of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. These effects are thought to mediate the therapeutic benefit of cyclic antidepressants. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure and function of cyclic antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tricyclic antidepressants are named after their chemical structure, which consists of a three-ring central structure plus a side chain. The tetracyclic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maprotiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maprotiline</a> has a four-ring central structure plus a side chain. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure and function of cyclic antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricyclics are subdivided into two categories. Tertiary amines have two methyl groups at the end of the side chain. The tertiary amines are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimipramine</a>. They are generally are more potent in blocking reuptake of serotonin compared with norepinephrine. Secondary amines have one methyl group at the end of the side chain, and include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a>. Secondary amines are more potent in blocking reuptake of norepinephrine. Tertiary amines generally cause more side effects compared with secondary amines. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure and function of cyclic antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricyclics are absorbed in the small intestine and undergo first-pass hepatic metabolism in the liver. They bind extensively to proteins and are widely distributed throughout the body. Metabolism and elimination occurs largely in the liver. Many of the tricyclic metabolites have antidepressant activity. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finding the right dose involves a process of trial and error. We suggest starting with a low dose in order to avoid side effects and slowly increasing the dose. Patients who do not respond to low or medium doses may benefit from high doses. Patients who recover from an acute episode of major depression should receive maintenance treatment with the full dose that successfully resolved the episode, rather than a lower dose. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The elimination half-life for the tricyclics and related drugs averages about 24 hours. The entire dose of a cyclic antidepressant is thus generally taken once a day, usually at bedtime because of sedating side effects. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H371273\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyclic antidepressants have been associated with heart block, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Before initiating treatment with any of the cyclic antidepressants, patients must be screened for cardiac conduction system disease, which precludes the use of these medications. We recommend that patients over age 40 years have a baseline ECG for this purpose. Patients younger than 40 can be screened by history for evidence of cardiac disease and do not require an ECG if the history is negative. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Baseline testing and monitoring for safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The side effects of cyclic antidepressants include cardiac effects, anticholinergic effects, antihistaminic effects, decreased seizure threshold, sexual dysfunction, diaphoresis, and tremor. These drugs are dangerous in overdose by suicidal patients (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above).</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">KUHN R.
