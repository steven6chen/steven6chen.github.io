The uterus is the part of a woman's body that carries a baby if she is pregnant. Another word for uterus is &quot;womb.&quot; If you have a hysterectomy, you will never be able to carry a pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456529976\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different kinds of surgery for hysterectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are 4 main kinds of surgery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal hysterectomy</strong> &ndash; To do a vaginal hysterectomy, the doctor makes cuts inside the vagina and removes the uterus through the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71521\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71521 \">figure 2</a>). Vaginal hysterectomy leaves no visible scars, but it is not always possible. Sometimes doctors do vaginal hysterectomy but also use the tools used in laparoscopic hysterectomy. This is called a &quot;laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.&quot; If this approach is used, the uterus is removed through the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laparoscopic hysterectomy</strong> &ndash; To do a laparoscopic hysterectomy, the doctor inserts a tiny camera and tools through small openings in the belly. Then he or she removes the uterus in a bag through one of the holes or through the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Robotic hysterectomy</strong> &ndash; In a variation of the laparoscopic approach, the tools used for the surgery are attached to a robot that the doctor controls. This is called &quot;robot-assisted laparoscopy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abdominal hysterectomy</strong> &ndash; To do an abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor makes a cut in the belly and removes the uterus through that opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57901 \">figure 3</a>). This is only done when a woman can't have the other types of hysterectomy. That's because it takes longer to recover from an abdominal hysterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456529983\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a woman need a hysterectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hysterectomy might be done to treat and of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal bleeding</strong> &ndash; Some women bleed too much during their period or at times when they should not be bleeding. This can lead to a condition called anemia, which can make you feel very tired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibroids</strong> &ndash; Fibroids are tough balls of muscle that form in the uterus. They can get very big and press on the organs inside the belly. They can also cause abnormal bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic organ prolapse</strong> &ndash; Pelvic organ prolapse is when the uterus falls down into the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53393 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cancer or conditions that could lead to cancer</strong> &ndash; Cancer can affect the uterus or the cervix, the organ that separates the uterus and the vagina. Sometimes doctors suggest removing these organs if they show signs that cancer is about to form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ongoing pelvic pain</strong> &ndash; Some women feel pain that will not go away in the area just below the belly. This is called &quot;chronic pelvic pain.&quot; Hysterectomy can sometimes help treat this pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456529990\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I do not want a hysterectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the conditions that are treated with hysterectomy can be treated in other ways instead. If you do not want the surgery, ask your doctor or nurse if you have other treatment options. Ask, too, what will happen if you do <strong>not</strong> have a hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456529997\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a hysterectomy, you will not be able to get pregnant. Unfortunately, if you have cancer or another serious problem, you might not be able to avoid having a hysterectomy. If you want to have children, speak to your doctor or nurse about your options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456530004\"><span class=\"h1\">Is the uterus the only organ that is removed during a hysterectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what you want and why you are having a hysterectomy. During a hysterectomy, doctors sometimes also remove the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervix &ndash; For a vaginal hysterectomy, the cervix must be removed. For an abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, the cervix can be removed or left in place. If the cervix is removed, it is called a total hysterectomy. If the cervix is left in place, it is called a subtotal or supracervical hysterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovaries and fallopian tubes &ndash; The ovaries are the organs that make eggs (which can become a baby) and female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone. The fallopian tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. The hormones made by the ovaries help keep bones healthy and are important for other aspects of health. Women who have their ovaries removed sometimes need to take hormone pills.</p><p/><p>If you are planning to have a hysterectomy, ask your doctor whether he or she is planning to remove your cervix and your ovaries and fallopian tubes. It is important to know this, because women who do not have a cervix need different medical care than women who do. Likewise, women who do not have ovaries sometimes need different medical care than women who do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456530011\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I have my ovaries and tubes removed if I have a hysterectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deciding whether or not to have your ovaries removed can be tough. You will need to think about how old you are, and about how not having ovaries might affect you.</p><p>In women who have not yet been through menopause, having the ovaries removed can lead to hot flashes, bone loss, reduced interest in sex, and other problems. In women who have been through menopause, having the ovaries removed might also increase the risk of health problems, such as heart disease, but the research is still not clear. On the other hand, women who have health problems that get worse at certain times in the menstrual cycle sometimes feel better without their ovaries. Plus, in rare cases, the ovaries can develop cancer, so women sometimes choose to have them removed. Before you have surgery, ask your doctor about the pros and cons of having your ovaries removed.</p><p>The fallopian tubes are not needed if a woman is not going to get pregnant. They can be removed at the time of hysterectomy, even if the ovaries are left behind. This can lower the risk of a rare type of cancer that can start in the fallopian tubes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456530018\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies show that women can have happy, full lives after a hysterectomy. Many women feel better after the surgery, because they no longer have the symptoms that bothered them before.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456530025\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heavy periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertoli-leydig-cell-tumor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic organ prolapse (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
