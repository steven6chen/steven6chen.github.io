HCAP referred to pneumonia acquired in healthcare facilities such as nursing homes, hemodialysis centers, and outpatient clinics. The rationale for the separate designation of HCAP (and its association with HAP) was that patients with HCAP were thought to be at higher risk for MDR organisms. However, several studies have shown that many patients defined as having HCAP are not at high risk for MDR pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Furthermore, although interaction with the healthcare system is potentially a risk for MDR pathogens, underlying patient characteristics are also important independent determinants of risk for MDR pathogens. It is anticipated that patients previously designated as HCAP will be included in the next update of the Infectious Diseases Society of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(IDSA)/American</span> Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines because patients with HCAP frequently present from the community and are initially cared for in emergency departments.</p><p>For these reasons, we feel that patients previously classified as having HCAP should be managed in a similar way to those with CAP, with the need for therapy targeting MDR pathogens being considered on a case-by-case basis. Specific risk factors for resistance that should be assessed include recent receipt of antimicrobials, major comorbidities, functional status, and severity of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H811135531\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE SITE OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining whether a patient with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be safely treated as an outpatient or requires admission to an observation unit, general medical ward, or higher acuity level of inpatient care, such as an intensive care unit (ICU), is an essential first step of medical management that will help inform downstream diagnostic and therapeutic decisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113076\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113076 \">algorithm 1</a>). Severity of illness is the most critical factor in making this determination, but other factors should also be taken into account. These include the ability to maintain oral intake, likelihood of medication adherence, history of active substance abuse, mental illness, cognitive or functional impairment, and living or social circumstances (eg, homelessness, residence far enough from a healthcare facility that precludes timely return to care in the event of clinical worsening).</p><p>Prediction rules have been developed to assist in the decision of site of care for CAP. Of the available rules, we strongly prefer the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-community-acquired-pneumonia-severity-index-psi-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) because it is the most accurate and its safety and effectiveness in guiding clinical decisionmaking have been empirically confirmed. The CURB-65 score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-curb-65-pneumonia-severity-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) is an alternative that can be used when a less complex scoring system for prognosis is desired, but its safety and effectiveness in guiding the initial site of treatment have not been empirically assessed. Clinical judgment should be used for all patients, incorporating the prediction rule scores as a component of the decision for hospitalization or ICU admission but not as an absolute determinant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The approach to site of care is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care#H4138189216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: Assessing severity and determining the appropriate site of care&quot;, section on 'Approach to site of care'</a>.)</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study of over one million Medicare beneficiaries (aged &gt;64 years) admitted to hospitals in the United States with pneumonia, ICU admission for patients with disease of marginal severity was associated with improved survival and no difference in costs compared with general ward admission, suggesting that ICU admission may benefit such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients living closer than the median differential distance (&lt;3.3 miles) to a hospital with high ICU admission rates were significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU than patients living farther away (36 versus 23 percent). Because most ill patients with pneumonia will seek care at the nearest hospital, patients who live close to a hospital with high ICU admission rates are more likely to be admitted to the ICU on a discretionary basis. In adjusted analyses, for the 13 percent of patients whose admission appeared to be discretionary (dependent only on distance), ICU admission was associated with a significantly lower adjusted 30-day mortality than patients admitted to a general ward (14.8 versus 20.5 percent). There were no differences in Medicare spending or hospitalization costs between the two groups. These results suggest a potential benefit of using broader ICU admission criteria but should be confirmed in a randomized trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of pathogens. The most common bacterial cause is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, for which the choice of initial antimicrobial therapy is complicated by the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The increasing availability of molecular tests has increased identification of respiratory viruses in CAP in adults. A study in the United States indicates that viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in adults admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is directed against the most common bacterial etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72014 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>].

The presence of an infiltrate on plain chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia when clinical (and, in some cases, microbiologic) features are supportive. A chest radiograph should be obtained in patients with suspected pneumonia when possible; a demonstrable infiltrate by chest radiograph or other imaging technique is required for the diagnosis of pneumonia, according to the 2007 consensus guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Radiologic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The sputum Gram stain can be useful for directing the choice of initial therapy if performed on a good quality sample and interpreted by skilled examiners using appropriate criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other diagnostic tests are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic testing for microbial etiology'</a>.)</p><p>The 2007 <span class=\"nowrap\">IDSA/ATS</span> guidelines on the management of CAP suggest that routine tests to identify an etiology for CAP are optional for patients who do not require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This recommendation is based in part upon the low rate of failure of empiric therapy in patients with CAP treated in the outpatient setting. The efficacy of empiric therapy was illustrated in a study of over 700 ambulatory patients treated for CAP in one of six emergency departments seen from November 2000 through April 2001, in which empiric antibiotics (a macrolide or fluoroquinolone in &gt;88 percent) were almost universally effective, with only 2.2 percent requiring hospitalization within three weeks of initial emergency department visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In contrast, testing for a microbial diagnosis is important in clinical or epidemiologic settings, suggesting possible infection with an organism that requires treatment different from standard empiric regimens. These include <em>Legionella </em>species, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, influenza A and B, avian influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (CA-MRSA), or agents of bioterrorism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Advances in molecular testing for etiology may allow for earlier pathogen-directed therapy than was previously possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sputum cultures for the evaluation of bacterial pneumonia&quot;, section on 'Community-acquired pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic therapy is typically begun on an empiric basis, since the causative organism is not identified in an appreciable proportion of cases of CAP treated in the outpatient setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72014 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. The clinical features and chest radiographic findings are not sufficiently specific to determine etiology and influence treatment decisions. Antibiotics should be started as soon as possible once the diagnosis of CAP is established. Since patients who do not require admission are often not given the first dose of antibiotics when they present for care, they should be counseled to fill their prescription without delay in order to achieve the best outcome.

Most studies have been performed in patients with <em>S. pneumoniae</em> infection and suggest that current levels of beta-lactam resistance generally do not cause treatment failure when appropriate agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>) and doses are used. Of the beta-lactams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> is a possible exception.

In addition, empiric use of fluoroquinolones should not be used for patients at risk for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> without an appropriate assessment for tuberculosis infection.

A limited number of pathogens are responsible for the majority of cases of CAP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72014 \">table 1</a>). However, local epidemiology, travel history, and other epidemiologic and clinical clues should be considered when selecting an empiric regimen. Antibiotics should be started as soon as possible once the diagnosis of CAP is established. The presence of an infiltrate on plain chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia when clinical (and, in some cases, microbiologic) features are supportive.
