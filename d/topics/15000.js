Multiple modalities of RRT are available. These include intermittent hemodialysis (IHD); continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs); and hybrid therapies, also known as prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapies (PIRRTs), such as sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and extended-duration dialysis (EDD). Despite these varied techniques, mortality in patients with AKI remains high, exceeding 40 to 50 percent in severely ill patients.

We electively initiate RRT among patients who are repeatedly in positive fluid balance despite aggressive attempts at diuresis, particularly if they have increasing oxygen requirements. Observational studies have demonstrated an association between the severity of volume overload at the time of initiation of RRT and mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>In the absence of clinically significant uremic symptoms or specific indications such as severe electrolyte abnormalities or volume overload, the optimal timing of RRT initiation is controversial. We generally suggest not initiating RRT in the absence of these indications, particularly if the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p>Randomized, controlled trials that have compared strategies of early versus delayed initiation of RRT (in the absence of obvious indications) have yielded conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. A meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials showed no benefit of early initiation on 30-, 60-, or 90-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was also no difference between early and late initiation on the risk of dialysis dependence, length of intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay, or recovery of renal function. However, the strength of this analysis is low in part because of heterogeneity due to variable definitions of early versus late initiation. In addition, most trials had an unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment.</p><p>Several of the largest trials in this analysis demonstrated no benefit with earlier initiation of RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The best data are from a multicenter, randomized trial that included 620 patients that had severe AKI and required either or both mechanical ventilation and catecholamine infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. AKI was defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria (an increase in serum creatinine to three times baseline, <strong>or</strong> increase in serum creatinine to &ge;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&ge;353.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L],</span> <strong>or</strong> reduction in urine output to &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for &ge;24 hours, <strong>or</strong> anuria for &ge;12 hours).

These patients were excluded because they were considered to have an urgent need for RRT and thus could not ethically be assigned to delayed RRT.</p><p>Patients were assigned to a strategy of early RRT (within six hours after documentation of severe AKI) or to a strategy of delayed RRT initiation. The delayed strategy required RRT initiation after the onset of severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or pulmonary edema, all defined by parameters included in the exclusion criteria listed above, or after an increase in BUN &gt;112 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or development of oliguria for more than 72 hours after allocation.</p><p>Overall, there was no obvious benefit associated with the early RRT strategy. Mortality at 60 days did not differ between the early- and late-strategy groups (48.5 versus 49.7 percent, respectively). Forty-nine percent of the patients in the delayed-strategy group never received RRT, and diuresis, possibly suggesting recovery of renal function, occurred earlier in the delayed-strategy group. Compared with the delayed-strategy group, catheter-related infections and hypophosphatemia were more common in the early-strategy group (5 versus 10 percent and 15 versus 22 percent, respectively).</p><p>Other, smaller, randomized trials have also shown no benefit associated with early initiation, although results need to be interpreted with caution as both trials were underpowered to detect mortality differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>One single-center, randomized trial showed a survival benefit conferred by early initiation of RRT (continuous hemodiafiltration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This trial included 231 critically ill patients with moderate AKI, as defined by KDIGO criteria for stage 2 (including creatinine &ge;2 times baseline or urinary output &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour)</span>. All patients also had severe sepsis, required vasopressors or catecholamines, or had refractory volume overload. Patients were assigned to early RRT initiation (within eight hours of AKI diagnosis) or to delayed or no initiation. Patients in the delayed- or no-initiation group received RRT within 12 hours after the patient achieved KDIGO stage 3 criteria (urine output &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for &ge;24 hours <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> threefold increase in serum creatinine or increase &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> with an acute increase of &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or developed an indication for RRT (such as serum urea level &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [comparable to BUN &gt;47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL],</span> potassium &gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> serum magnesium &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> urine output 200 mL over 12 hours, or diuretic-resistant edema). In the delayed-initiation group, 11 patients ended up not receiving RRT; of these, only six patients did not progress to stage 3, three patients had recovery of renal function, and three patients died.</p><p>Compared with delayed or no initiation, early RRT initiation reduced 90-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.97). Moreover, more patients recovered renal function in the early versus delayed group by 90 days (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.93), and both the duration of RRT and the hospital stay were shorter in the early-initiation group.</p><p>However, although this was a carefully performed trial, it is difficult to understand how such small differences in the timing of dialysis initiation could achieve such widespread improvement in outcomes. Since almost all patients ended up receiving RRT, the only difference between groups was the time to RRT initiation, which was less than 24 hours. It is possible that the relatively small size of the trial resulted in an overestimate of the treatment benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A shift of three events between the treatment groups would have resulted in a loss of statistically significant differences between groups.</p><p>Other randomized trials, including Initiation of Dialysis Early versus Delayed in Intensive Care Unit (IDEAL-ICU; NCT01682590) and Standard versus Accelerated Initiation of RRT in AKI (STARRT-AKI; NCT02568722), are underway and may allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn.</p><p>The KDIGO guidelines state that RRT should be initiated emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist but also suggest that, among patients who do not have life-threatening indications, the clinician consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests, rather than using any specific BUN or creatinine threshold, when making the decision to initiate RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIMAL MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of modalities are available for RRT. These include intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), peritoneal dialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and hybrid therapies such as sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (SLED).</p><p>Data do not support the superiority of any particular mode of RRT in patients with AKI. In the majority of patients, selection of modality should therefore be based upon local expertise and availability of staff and equipment. However, in selected patients, other factors may prevail. As an example, in patients with acute brain injury or fulminant hepatic failure, continuous therapy may be associated with better preservation of cerebral perfusion. However, the costs associated with CRRT may be greater than with other modalities of RRT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous renal replacement therapies versus intermittent hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRRT represents a family of modalities that provides continuous support for severely ill patients with AKI. These include continuous hemofiltration, hemodialysis, and hemodiafiltration, which involve both convective and diffusive therapies. Although superior clearance of middle- and larger-molecular-weight molecules is associated with convective therapies (hemofiltration) compared with diffusive therapies (hemodialysis), there are no studies clearly showing improved clinical outcomes compared with the type of solute transport.</p><p>Studies suggest that survival and recovery of renal function are similar with both CRRT and IHD, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI suggest using intermittent and continuous RRT as complementary therapies in patients with AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The majority of studies comparing CRRT and IHD have been observational or retrospective case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. After adjustment for severity of illness, there appears to be no survival benefit associated with CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. One observational series has suggested an increased adjusted mortality risk associated with CRRT, although incomplete adjustment for severity of illness may have confounded this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Of greater importance, multiple prospective, randomized studies have also compared outcomes of AKI supported using either IHD or CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter study, 166 patients with AKI were randomly assigned to IHD or CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. CRRT was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality at 28 days (59.5 versus 41.5 percent) and in-hospital mortality (65.5 versus 47.6 percent). However, despite randomization, patients randomly assigned to CRRT were significantly more likely to have higher Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III scores and liver failure. After adjustment for these characteristics, there was no increased risk of death with CRRT (adjusted odds of death 1.58, CI 0.7-3.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the HemoDiafe Study (a prospective, multicenter, French study), 360 patients with AKI and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome were randomly assigned to IHD or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The primary endpoint was survival at 60 days. Severity of illness was similar in both randomized groups, protocol adherence was good, both groups used the same dialysis membranes, and there was a low rate of crossover from intermittent to continuous therapies (3.3 percent). At 60 days, survival was the <strong>same</strong> in both groups (32 and 33 percent in the intermittent and continuous groups, respectively). In addition, both therapies were associated with similar rates of hypotension, including the group of hemodynamically unstable patients.</p><p/><p>While the HemoDiafe Study was the largest and most rigorously conducted randomized, controlled trial comparing modality of RRT in AKI, definitive conclusions must be tempered by limitations of the trial design and execution. The use of heparin, rather than regional anticoagulation during continuous therapy, may have contributed to issues of systemic bleeding and clotting of the extracorporeal circuit. In addition, over the duration of the study, the mortality rate in the intermittent therapy arm declined over time, whereas it remained constant in the continuous therapy arm. The reasons for these trends are uncertain and may reflect changes in delivery of IHD over time. In addition, the mean duration of the hemodialysis treatments were longer than is typically employed in clinical practice, raising questions regarding the ability to translate these results into clinical practice. Importantly, however, this study demonstrates that is possible to successfully perform IHD in practically all patients with AKI given the findings of similar hypotensive rates with stable and unstable patients and the low crossover rate from intermittent to continuous therapy.</p><p>The Clinical Trial Comparing Continuous versus Intermittent Hemodialysis in Intensive Care Unit Patients (CONVINT) trial was a single-center, randomized, controlled trial of 252 critically ill patients in Germany who were randomly assigned to continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) at a prescribed dose of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> or daily hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nineteen and one-half percent of the 128 patients randomized to IHD were switched to CVVH after a mean of 4.4&plusmn;12 days for severe hypotension or volume management, while 45.9 percent of patients randomized to CVVH were switched to IHD after a mean of 6.2&plusmn;5.6 days because of repeated filter clotting, bleeding necessitating discontinuation of anticoagulation, metabolic control, thrombocytopenia, or improvement in overall status and need for mobilization.</p><p>Survival 14 days after discontinuation of RRT was 39.5 percent in the IHD group as compared with 43.9 percent in the CVVH group, with no difference in in-hospital mortality or mortality at 30 days of follow-up. Similarly, there was no difference in recovery of kidney function.</p><p>Meta-analyses that compared outcomes with CRRT and IHD have also been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>].

When the analysis combined mortality and nonrecovery of renal function, both groups showed similar recovery of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

These observations were confirmed in a meta-analysis that included 3971 survivors of RRT-requiring AKI. A pooled analysis of 16 observational studies (n = 3499) showed a higher rate of dialysis dependence associated with IHD, but analysis of seven randomized trials (n = 472) showed no difference in recovery of kidney function between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other differences &ndash; CRRT may be associated with the following advantages compared with IHD:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enhanced hemodynamic stability, which may be particularly beneficial in hemodynamically unstable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Patients treated with PIRRT required fewer days of mechanical ventilation, required fewer days in the intensive care unit (ICU), and received fewer blood transfusions, resulting in an overall lower cost of therapy. A subsequent meta-analysis of 7 randomized, controlled trials and 10 observational studies comparing PIRRT with CRRT found no difference in mortality or recovery of kidney function associated with modality of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

A markedly increased risk of death was observed among the group administered peritoneal dialysis (47 versus 15 percent, odds ratio [OR] 5.1, 95% CI 1.6-16). Possible reasons for the poorer survival in the peritoneal dialysis group include lower overall creatinine clearance, use of acetate (not bicarbonate) in the peritoneal dialysis dialysate, and other peritoneal dialysis-specific factors that are not yet defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the peritoneal dialysate was made in the study hospital pharmacy, while commercial peritoneal dialysate used in most countries contains lactate instead of acetate, and was performed using rigid catheters. The use of heparin in the hemofiltration arm may also have had therapeutic benefit in patients with malaria. Extrapolation from this study is limited as the study population was very different from that encountered in most developed countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, controlled trial compared high-volume peritoneal dialysis to daily IHD in 120 patients with acute tubular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Thus, outcomes may vary based upon differences in dose per session, as applied to a fixed treatment schedule, or with differences in treatment schedule, as applied to a fixed dose per session. In addition, alterations in the dose per session as well as in the dialysis schedule can also be evaluated.</p><p>There have been no studies that have prospectively evaluated the impact of differences in dose per session in patients undergoing IHD on a fixed schedule, such as three times per week. Some data suggest that dosing may have an impact on patients with intermediate levels of disease severity. For example, in a retrospective study of 844 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) with AKI that used <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> as a measure of the delivered dose of acute IHD, improved survival was observed with a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> (&gt;1) among patients with <strong>intermediate levels</strong> of illness severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. By comparison, among those either extremely ill or not very ill, the intensity of the dialysis treatments was less influential on outcome.</p><p>In one study that evaluated the impact of frequency of IHD on outcomes, 160 patients with AKI were assigned in an alternating fashion to either daily or every-other-day hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Enrolled patients were likely to have intermediate levels of illness severity, which was supported by both Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores and the concurrent offering of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) at the study center. Compared with every-other-day dialysis, daily therapy was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (28 versus 46 percent), fewer hypotensive episodes during hemodialysis, and more rapid resolution of AKI (mean 9 versus 16 days). The delivered dialysis dose in the every other day group, as assessed by single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> was <strong>low</strong> (0.94 per dialysis). By comparison, the daily dialysis group received the same per treatment delivered dose, but it was delivered twice as frequently. Thus, this study may have best concluded that inadequate therapy is associated with increased mortality.</p><p>In contrast, the Veterans Affairs <span class=\"nowrap\">(VA)/National</span> Institutes of Health (NIH) Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) study did <strong>not</strong> find a difference in mortality associated with a more intensive dosing strategy for RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The details of this study are discussed in the next section.</p><p>The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend delivering a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 3.9 per week for patients undergoing intermittent therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. While these results are loosely based on the results of the ATN study, several caveats need to be considered. In the ATN study, the targeted dose of IHD in both treatment arms was a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.2 to 1.4 per treatment, with a median delivered <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.3 per treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The weekly dose of dialysis recommended in the KDIGO guidelines is the arithmetic sum of the median dose in the less intensive arm, summed over the course of a week. Since a median delivered <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.3 implies that half of treatments had a delivered <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of less than this value, it is not clear that a per-treatment dose of 1.3 represents the appropriate target. In addition, the approach of taking the arithmetic sum of the individual treatment dose to calculate a weekly dose is not consistent with urea kinetic modeling; the weekly dose provided by six treatments with a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 0.65 is not equivalent to three treatments with a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. We therefore recommend that, if IHD is provided three times per week, the targeted dose of therapy should be a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of &ge;1.2 per treatment, with monitoring of the delivered dose of therapy. If this minimum dose is achieved, there is <strong>no</strong> evidence that more frequent hemodialysis is associated with improved outcomes, unless necessitated for specific acute indications (eg, hyperkalemia). Conversely, if a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of &ge;1.2 per treatment cannot be achieved, treatment frequency should be increased.</p><p>If more frequent IHD is provided, the targeted dose per treatment may be lower; however, the optimal dose is not defined. Surveys of practice in the United States suggest that monitoring of the delivered dose of hemodialysis is only infrequently assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The Hanover Dialysis Outcome (HAND-OUT) study compared extended-duration dialysis (EDD), provided for approximately eight hours per day, with a more intensive regimen where additional eight-hour treatment sessions were provided to maintain the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &lt;42 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

In addition, the duration of RRT and the rate of recovery of kidney function or nonrenal organ failure were similar for both treatment arms. The group that received intensive therapy had an increased number of hypotensive episodes. Thus, more intensive renal support beyond that obtained with a standard thrice-weekly regimen (with a target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.2 to 1.4 per treatment) or standard CRRT (with an effluent flow rate of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour) does not improve clinical outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level of Replacement Therapy (RENAL) study (a trial in Australia and New Zealand), 1508 patients with AKI were randomly assigned to continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at an effluent flow of either 25 or 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. At 90 days, mortality was the same in each group (44.7 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.31-1.23). In addition, the incidence of patients who continued to receive RRT at 90 days was similar with both dialysis doses (6.8 and 4.4 percent of higher- and lower-intensity groups [OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.86-2.92]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three meta-analyses (3841 patients and 8 trials, 3999 patients and 12 trials, and 2402 patients and 5 trials) found that more intensive therapy did not improve survival compared with less intensive regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

In the Dose Response Multicentre International Collaborative Initiative (DO-RE-MI) study of 338 patients treated with CRRT, for example, the median delivered dose of CRRT was 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> despite a median prescribed dose of 34.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In addition, the actual time on therapy each day in both the ATN and RENAL studies probably exceeded the time on therapy achieved in clinical practice due to enhanced attention to minimizing interruptions in therapy. We therefore suggest that the prescribed dose exceed the desired delivered dose by a factor of approximately 20 to 25 percent to adjust for interruptions in study therapy.</p><p>In a patient-level meta-analysis of seven randomized, controlled trials comparing more intensive with less intensive RRT in AKI, more intensive RRT was associated with delayed recovery of kidney function, particularly in patients in whom the initial modality of RRT was CRRT, but was not associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28569002\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCONTINUATION OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RRT is usually continued until the patient manifests evidence of recovery of kidney function. Most often, recovery is assessed based on empiric data. In oliguric patients, the primary manifestation of recovery of kidney function is an increase in urine output; however, this finding may not be apparent in patients who are nonoliguric. Recovery of kidney function may also be manifest by a progressive decline in serum creatinine concentration after initial attainment of stable values (assessed daily during continuous renal replacement therapy [CRRT] or predialysis in patients managed with intermittent hemodialysis [IHD]) despite a constant dose of renal support. More objective assessment of recovery of kidney function can be obtained by measurement of creatinine clearance. As an example, in the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) study, creatinine clearance was assessed on six-hour timed urine collections obtained when the urine output exceeded 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Since the serum creatinine concentration may not be constant during the collection, the average concentration can be estimated by measuring serum creatinine at the beginning and end of the timed collection or based on the midpoint serum creatinine concentration. A precise level of kidney function needed to allow discontinuation of renal support has not been established; however, a creatinine clearance &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> is probably inadequate to allow discontinuation of therapy. In the ATN study, renal support was discontinued when the measured creatinine clearance exceeded 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and was left to the discretion of providers when in the range of 12 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4292914391\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Urgent indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is preferable to initiate RRT electively prior to the development of an urgent indication. Absolute thresholds based on azotemia or other measures are not well defined; thus, when to initiate RRT is a matter of clinical judgment as well as circumstance. We electively initiate RRT prior to the development of severe electrolyte disturbances and volume overload. We favor electively initiating RRT in patients with K &gt;6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or severe metabolic acidosis (pH &lt;7.20) despite optimal medical management who show no sign that kidney function or metabolic acidosis is improving. We electively initiate RRT in patients who are repeatedly in positive fluid balance despite aggressive attempts at diuresis, particularly if they have increasing oxygen requirements. We generally do not initiate RRT in the absence of these indications, particularly if the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Timing of elective initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data do not support the superiority of either continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD).
