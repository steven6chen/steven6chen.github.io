The classic triad of features of DGS on presentation is conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia (resulting from parathyroid hypoplasia). Deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 are present in most patients with DGS, as well as in patients with other similar syndromes, such as velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS, also called Shprintzen syndrome). These conditions are grouped together under the term chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS).</p><p>Infants with DGS or 22qDS may have some or all features of the classic triad, in addition to other associated congenital anomalies, listed with percent of individuals affected in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72911 \">table 1</a>). A broad spectrum characterizes the presence and severity of individual features. The severity of each feature appears to be independent of other features. Thus, an infant may have a severe conotruncal cardiac defect but normal calcium and only mild T cell lymphocytopenia or, alternatively, no heart disease but significant hypocalcemia and absent T cells. It is important to establish the presence and extent of abnormalities upon diagnosis and then to manage each one in collaboration with appropriate specialists.</p><p>This topic reviews the management and prognosis of patients with DGS and 22qDS, with particular emphasis on immunologic aspects of the disease. Transplantation options for complete DGS are discussed. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of DGS and 22qDS are presented separately.

An initial evaluation by each specialist team is recommended to establish care, determine the degree of specific organ system involvement, and outline necessary surveillance monitoring and follow-up care. As patients with DGS get older, other associated medical conditions may emerge, such as behavioral and psychiatric conditions, requiring referral to appropriate specialists. Patients with DGS have individualized and often complex medical care needs. The best approach for optimizing quality of life in these patients requires a medical home model that is flexible and adept at facilitating specialized complex care and transitions of care from pediatrics to internal medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT IN INFANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute management of neonates suspected of having DGS or 22qDS is focused upon evaluation and management of possible hypocalcemia and significant congenital cardiac defects and identification and treatment of infants with complete DGS, a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac emergencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with DGS may require emergent cardiothoracic surgery for conotruncal cardiac defects.

If blood products are needed (eg, in infants undergoing heart surgery), they should be leukocyte depleted, cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative, and irradiated. If the patient has received unirradiated blood transfusions, then tests for CMV and lymphoid chimerism should be done prior to transplantation, which is the treatment of choice for confirmed complete DGS. Other general management issues for SCID are presented elsewhere.

The advent of widespread newborn screening for SCID with the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) test in the United States has resulted in recognition of the infants with complete DGS and partial DGS accompanied by a significant degree of T cell lymphopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Ideally, patients should be transplanted before the onset of significant infections to optimize their chances for successful engraftment and survival.

In infants with DGS and 22qDS, the bone marrow appears to be normal, but the maturation of hematopoietic precursors into T cells is prevented by lack of thymic tissue. Thymic tissue transplant, therefore, is the logical choice for curative treatment but has limited availability. HCT, using bone marrow or peripheral blood sources, has also been performed with success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Slices of thymic tissue procured during infant cardiac surgery are cultured ex vivo to remove mature T cells and then implanted in the quadriceps muscle of the patient. However, relatively few patients have undergone fetal thymic transplant since the procedure was first attempted in the 1960s, largely due to the scarcity of thymic donor tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Few centers perform this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the largest series of patients treated with cultured postnatal thymic transplantation, 43 of 60 infants were alive at the time of reporting, with a median survival of 4.7 years (range 6 months to 16 years) in these 43 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of the 17 deaths following transplant, all but two occurred in the first 12 months after the procedure. Most were secondary to infections, with higher risk of mortality-related infection associated with tracheostomies or mechanical ventilation. One death was secondary to complications of calcium therapy. In patients with &quot;atypical&quot; complete DGS (absent thymus but oligoclonal populations of T cells present), immunosuppressive therapy such as antithymocyte globulin was administered prior to thymic transplantation to allow for tissue engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. The use of immunosuppression did not appear to alter the outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematopoietic cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCT is a suitable, technically easier, and more readily available alternative to thymic transplantation in the patient with complete DGS who has an HLA-identical donor. Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (long-term, self-renewing, pluripotent progenitors) only, rather than stem cells and memory T cells, is not recommended in patients with DGS, since donor-derived T cells cannot develop from lymphoid progenitor cells in the absence of thymic tissue. The increase in T cell numbers following HCT in patients with DGS is secondary to expansion of donor memory T cells and not generation of na&iuml;ve T cells (as would be expected in the absence of a thymus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16-18</a>]. Thus, HCT does not restore a full T cell repertoire, although it appears to provide adequate immune function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An international survey identified 17 patients with complete DGS (eight with 22q11.2 deletion, five with a chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 [CHD7] mutation, four unknown) who underwent HCT from 1995 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Donors included HLA-identical relatives, a haploidentical parent (with T cell depletion), and matched, unrelated donors (bone marrow or peripheral blood), and one cord blood source. Pretransplant conditioning was used in five patients, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was used in 11 patients. GVHD developed in nine of the patients and may be more severe in this subset of SCID patients compared with SCID patients with thymic tissue. The overall survival rate was 41 percent (7 of 17), with a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 4 to 11.5 years), and only two patients did not experience serious adverse events. Among the 10 patients who did not survive, death occurred at a median of seven months posttransplant (range, 2 to 18 months). Survival was higher (five of seven, 71 percent) in patients with an HLA-identical sibling donor. The most common causes of death were due to problems related to the underlying disorder and complications from HCT. Five additional patients who underwent HCT are reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8,16,17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16,17,19,20</a>].

However, the appropriateness of avoidance of live vaccines has been questioned since the risk of natural infection continues to exist, and there is increasing evidence that T cell function is normal in most patients with DGS. Thus, the decision to administer live vaccines to patients with DGS is made on a case-by-case basis, following a discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient or caregivers.
