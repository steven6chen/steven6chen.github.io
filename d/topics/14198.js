Transfused RBC units do not need to be antigenically identical to the recipient's RBCs, but they do need to lack antigens that could provoke clinically significant hemolysis in the recipient (eg, a blood group A donor unit transfused to a blood group O recipient).</p><p>This topic discusses the practical aspects of compatibility testing and interpretation of potential results from this testing.</p><p>Separate topic reviews provide an overview of RBC antigens and their clinical significance, management of the patient for whom compatible cells cannot be found, practical aspects of blood transfusion, and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions.

AABB publishes a technical manual approximately every three years and standards for blood banks and transfusion services as well as cellular therapy every two years. The organization was formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks; the name was changed to AABB in 2005 to reflect its expanded (international) scope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiglobulin (Coombs) testing</strong> &ndash; Testing that employs a secondary antibody directed against human immunoglobulins and complement proteins to detect antibodies in patient serum that bind RBCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100639\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100639 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This testing is important in pretransfusion testing for identifying antibodies that do not cause RBC agglutination directly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Direct</strong> antiglobulin testing (DAT, also called direct Coombs testing) is used to detect antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement on the surface of RBCs. The DAT is performed by incubating RBCs in a tube with a secondary antibody directed against human immunoglobulins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement. RBCs coated with immunoglobulins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement will be agglutinated by the anti-human antibody. The DAT is positive when there is an RBC autoantibody (self antibody directed against self RBCs) or an alloantibody (antibody directed against foreign RBCs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Indirect</strong> antiglobulin testing (indirect Coombs testing) is used to detect alloantibodies or autoantibodies present in <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span>. The indirect antiglobulin test is performed by adding the secondary antibody to reagent RBCs following incubation with patient <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span>. If the patient's <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span> contains antibodies to antigens on the RBCs, the RBCs will be agglutinated. This testing is used both to evaluate suspected immune mediated hemolysis, similar to the DAT, as well as in compatibility testing to determine whether patient <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span> contains antibodies that could react with transfused RBCs. (See <a href=\"#H3796831\" class=\"local\">'Antibody screen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibody screen</strong> &ndash; Testing that detects the presence of antibodies directed against RBC antigens that may require special attention should a patient require transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood type</strong> &ndash; Blood type (also called blood group) refers to ABO and Rh(D) antigens expressed on an individual's RBCs. Blood type from a donation card or military tag is never sufficient evidence for compatibility with a specific recipient. ABO and Rh(D) typing are required every time a red cell transfusion is ordered. (See <a href=\"#H645806\" class=\"local\">'ABO and Rh(D) type'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinically significant antibody</strong> &ndash; Clinically significant antibodies are antibodies that could decrease the survival of transfused RBCs. In practice, these are usually antibodies that react with RBC antigens and cause hemolysis at 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F), rather than those that react at room temperature. Antibodies directed against a variety of red cell antigens are implicated; the vast majority of these antibodies are readily detected by the RBC antibody screen. (See <a href=\"#H3796831\" class=\"local\">'Antibody screen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Crossmatch (compatibility testing)</strong> &ndash; Crossmatch or compatibility testing refers to the selection and testing of a specific donor unit of RBCs for transfusion to the recipient. Crossmatching is generally done when there is a reasonably high chance that transfusion will be required. The extent of testing required for a crossmatch depends on the recipient's antibody screen and prior transfusion history. (See <a href=\"#H3796845\" class=\"local\">'Compatibility testing (crossmatch)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor#H808432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;, section on 'Protection of the recipient'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emergency release</strong> &ndash; Emergency release blood is available for immediate transfusion when there is insufficient time to perform pretransfusion testing (blood type, RBC antibody screen, and compatibility testing). This differs from &quot;massive transfusion,&quot; in which a large number of units of RBCs (often with platelets and plasma) are required to treat major bleeding. In some cases of massive transfusion, emergency release blood is used (eg, treatment of massive trauma when pretransfusion testing is incomplete); in others, it is not needed (eg, scheduled liver transplantation). (See <a href=\"#H646368\" class=\"local\">'Emergency release/insufficient time for testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forward (front) type and reverse (back) type</strong> &ndash; Forward (front) type defines ABO antigens present on the surface of red cells. Reverse (back) determines the antibodies to A and B antigens in a patient&rsquo;s <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span>. The forward (front) type and reverse (back) type must fit set criteria in order to assign an ABO type. If the criteria are not met, the ABO type is reported as unresolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed field agglutination</strong> &ndash; Descriptive term characterizing the agglutination pattern observed when there are two populations of RBCs, one of which expresses a particular antigen and one that does not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Panagglutinin</strong> &ndash; Descriptive term characterizing a pattern of reactions observed when determining the antibody specificity in a patient with a positive antibody screen. In this case, the antibody agglutinates all reagent red cells at the same strength of agglutination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type and screen</strong> &ndash; Type and screen refers to testing only on the recipient sample, including ABO and Rh(D) type and antibody screen. A compatible unit is not identified. Type and screen is appropriate for patients who are unlikely to require transfusion but would benefit from the information should transfusion become necessary (eg, in association with surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27221920\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27221927\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimen age/collection date</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blood sample used for testing must reflect the patient's blood type and the antibodies present in patient plasma at the time transfusion will be administered. These are usually constant, so there is no absolute requirement for the <span class=\"nowrap\">age/collection</span> date of the sample in a patient who has not been exposed to foreign RBCs through recent transfusion or pregnancy.</p><p>In contrast, in patients who have been pregnant within the previous three months (or are currently pregnant); patients who have received a transfusion within the previous three months; or patients for whom the recent pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfusion history is uncertain, samples for pretransfusion testing must be less than three days old. The rationale is that exposure to foreign antigens may have occurred and may have induced formation of an alloantibody. The collection day is counted as day 0, and the sample expires at midnight on day 3; so a sample collected on Monday would expire Thursday night at midnight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27221934\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimen collection tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compatibility testing can be performed on plasma, using blood drawn into a tube with EDTA; or serum, from a clotted sample. In general, plasma is preferred over serum for testing because it eliminates the possibility of small fibrin clots that form during the clotting process, which may interfere with assessment of agglutination. Specimen tubes with gel separator material (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">red/black</span> &quot;tiger-top&quot; tubes) should not be used for pretransfusion testing because contamination of the serum by the gel material may interfere with interpretation of agglutination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In general, one 6 mL tube containing EDTA (eg, &quot;pink top tube&quot; or &quot;purple top tube&quot;) is sufficient for all routine blood bank pre-transfusion testing, including type and screen and compatibility testing. For patients with more complex serological issues (eg, multiple alloantibodies or warm autoantibodies), additional specimen tubes may be needed to complete transfusion testing. In these cases, the transfusion service will notify the clinician and request additional tubes.</p><p>Of note, hemolysis or lipemia may interfere with interpretation of agglutination due to color <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cloudiness of the plasma. The laboratory has specimen acceptance criteria that, when not met, will trigger a request for new samples for testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27221941\"><span class=\"h2\">Labeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A properly labeled sample is critical to the safety of blood transfusion; a clerical error may lead to a fatal transfusion reaction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Labeling of the specimen must occur immediately after specimen collection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The person who draws the blood must identify the patient, preferably actively by asking the patient their name and date of birth, and label the tube using at least two forms of unique patient-identifying information (eg, patient name, medical record number, date of birth); the date the blood was drawn; and identifying information for the individual who drew the blood sample.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information on the blood tube must match the information on the requisition for compatibility testing, and institution-specific specimen labeling policies should be followed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many laboratories and transfusion services require two separate specimens for blood type verification in order to further reduce the chance of incorrect compatibility testing results based on a mislabeled specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Mislabeled or incompletely labeled specimen tubes should be discarded and a new sample collected in order to avoid possible mis-transfusion. If blood is needed urgently, emergency release blood should be requested.

It determines the presence of A, B, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Rh(D) antigens on the patient's RBCs (ie, the front type) because individuals who lack any of these antigens can produce antibodies to them capable of causing severe hemolysis.</p><p>Antibodies to A <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> B are present in the plasma of the vast majority of individuals who lack these antigens (ie, the back type), even in the absence of prior transfusion, from exposure to gut bacteria that share similar epitopes (ie, molecular mimicry).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type O individuals lack both A and B antigens and make antibodies to both A and B. Type O individuals can receive only type O RBCs due to the presence of anti-A and anti-B in their plasma. However, they are considered universal blood donors because their RBCs lack the A and B antigens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type AB individuals have both A and B antigens and do not make antibodies to A or B.

They can receive type O or B RBCs.</p><p/><p>The Rh blood group system includes several antigens, but only the Rh(D) status is included in the blood type.

This serves to preserve the limited Rh(D)-negative inventory for patients in whom alloimmunization can be clinically problematic, such as in prevention of HDFN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796831\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody screen</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353011\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of antibody screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody screening is done on all patients. It is used to detect antibodies in patient <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span> that might react with antigens on transfused RBCs and cause hemolysis. RBC units with the corresponding antigens can be excluded from release to the recipient without the need for additional testing.</p><p>The antibody screen is done by incubating the patient's <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span> at 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F) with a panel of well-characterized, blood group O, &quot;reagent&quot; RBCs expressing combinations of commonly encountered, clinically significant RBC antigens. Antibody screening can be performed manually or on an automated system, in liquid or solid phase. Institution-specific guidelines for appropriate testing and quality controls should be used. In cases in which there is a need to deviate from standard protocols, involvement of the transfusion service is important to clarify any potential transfusion-related risks for the patient (eg, need for emergency release blood when antibody screen is incomplete).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies that are always considered to be potentially clinically significant include those directed against the following blood group systems (antigens within the system in parentheses): ABO (A, B), Rh (D, C, c, E, e), Duffy (Fya, Fyb), Kidd (Jka, Jkb), Kell (K, k), and SsU (S, s, U).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies that are rarely or never considered to be clinically significant include those directed against: Lewis (Lea, Leb), MN, P1, Xga, Cartwright (Yta), Bg, York (Yka), <span class=\"nowrap\">Chido/Rodgers</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Cha/Rga),</span> Sda; as well as high titer low avidity (HTLA) antibodies.</p><p/><p>Patients found to have clinically significant antibodies should be restricted to antigen-negative RBCs for all future transfusions, even if the antibodies are not apparent on subsequent routine testing. Many transfusion services send letters to patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &quot;wallet cards&quot; alerting them to this requirement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353017\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several approaches are available for assaying the presence of an antibody; these all demonstrate the presence and degree of agglutination, but differ in the method of scoring the agglutination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100638 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646468\"><span class=\"h4\">Tube-method (liquid phase testing)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tube (liquid phase) testing is carried out in a test tube to which an aliquot of reagent RBCs and patient's <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span> have been added in a specific ratio. Depending on institutional protocol, additive solutions are added to the mixture to potentiate interaction of RBC antibodies, if present in the patient's <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum,</span> with reagent RBCs. The mixture is incubated at 37&deg;C for 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the additive solution used), and the cellular mixture is &quot;washed&quot; to remove additive. Following this, anti-human globulin (AHG) reagent is added to enhance detection of antibody coated RBCs. This mixture is centrifuged and assessed for RBC agglutination, which indicates the presence of antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Various additive solutions may be used to enhance antibody detection. However, they may also enhance detection of antibodies that are not clinically significant (eg, non-pathologic cold autoantibodies). Additive solutions that may be used include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Albumin</strong> &ndash; Albumin is thought to reduce repulsive forces between cells (the Zeta potential), thereby enhancing antibody-antigen interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PEG (polyethylene glycol)</strong> &ndash; PEG is thought to promote exclusion of water molecules at the RBC surface, thereby promoting antibody-antigen interactions. PEG generally enhances sensitivity of antibody detection. However, it can enhance warm reactive antibodies and thus interfere with the detection of alloantibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>LISS (low ionic strength saline)</strong> &ndash; LISS enhances antibody-antigen interactions by lowering the tonicity of the incubation mixture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enzymes</strong> &ndash; The most commonly used enzymes include ficin and papain. These enzymes cleave sialic acid molecules from polysaccharides on the RBC surface, causing a reduction in RBC surface membrane charge, which in turn promotes antibody-antigen interactions. Enzymatic treatment must be used as an adjunct to the methods listed above because these enzymes can destroy some RBC antigens (eg, MNSs-system antigens, and Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigens) and could give misleading results if used in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646480\"><span class=\"h4\">Solid-phase adherence method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The solid-phase adherence method is similar to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, in that one component (antigen or antibody) is immobilized in a solid matrix affixed to a microplate well. For antibody detection, RBCs or RBC membranes with known antigens are affixed to the solid matrix. Patient plasma or serum is added to the wells and incubated, permitting antibody to interact with antigens. Following incubation and wash steps, indicator RBCs coated with anti-IgG are added. If antibodies to specific RBC antigens are present, the indicator cells will adhere and produce a disbursed pattern within the well. If no antibody is present, the indicator cells will settle to the bottom of the well as a pellet. A benefit of the solid-phase adherence method is the ability to automate the antibody screening process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646486\"><span class=\"h4\">Column agglutination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Column agglutination techniques employ glass beads or gel to separate agglutinated RBCs from non-agglutinated RBCs following incubation of patient <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum</span> with reagent RBCs. Advantages of this technique over tube-method include reduced sample size, ability to set up multiple specimens simultaneously on an automated centrifugation platform, improved objectivity of result interpretation, and stability of gel cards to allow review for up to 24 hours after testing, which is particularly helpful for questionable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796845\"><span class=\"h2\">Compatibility testing (crossmatch)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360777\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of compatibility testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compatibility testing, also known as crossmatching, is required for all patients for whom a RBC unit is requested.

If a pretransfusion specimen was not drawn prior to initiation of resuscitation, the transfusion service is obligated to continued release of type O red cells and type AB plasma, which can pose a significant drain on precious resources.

In some cases, the amount of circulating anti-A or B may interfere with crossmatching. This can be circumvented by restricting patients to group O red cells for transfusion.

Recommendations for selection of RBCs, platelets, and plasma are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99896 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H855910648\"><span class=\"h2\">Solid organ transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, solid organ transplant is carried out using ABO identical donor organs. However, similar to hematopoietic cell transplantation &quot;minor ABO-incompatible&quot; solid organ transplants can be performed (eg, group O donor organ transplanted to non-group O recipient). In some cases of minor ABO-incompatible solid organ transplant, transient RBC hemolysis may be observed. This is caused by the production of anti-A or anti-B by donor lymphocytes (passenger lymphocytes) that accompany the transplanted organ. If hemolysis due to anti-A or anti-B is brisk, necessitating RBC transfusion, donor-type RBCs (eg, group O RBCs) may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Hemolysis due to passenger lymphocytes is transient, generally abating within a month following transplant following clearance of donor lymphocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-and-transfusion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6905041\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terminology used in compatibility testing is presented above. (See <a href=\"#H27221913\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specimen for compatibility testing must reflect the patient's blood type and the antibodies present in patient plasma at the time transfusion will be administered. A properly labeled tube containing patient serum or plasma obtained within three days is appropriate for most patients; those without exposure to foreign RBCs can use an older specimen in accordance with blood bank policy. Additional information regarding prior transfusions, transfusion reactions, allogeneic hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplantation, special modifications required, and pregnancy history can be very helpful to the transfusion service and may prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions. (See <a href=\"#H27221920\" class=\"local\">'Specimen requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergent</span> situations, time may be insufficient to perform full compatibility testing (eg, life-threatening anemia, brisk hemolysis, rapid bleeding). Decisions regarding transfusion in such settings depend on assessment of the risks and benefits of immediate transfusion versus full compatibility testing. Importantly, &quot;emergency release&quot; blood is always available for immediate lifesaving transfusion. Blood designated for emergency release is typically group O. (See <a href=\"#H646368\" class=\"local\">'Emergency release/insufficient time for testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a lower likelihood of requiring a transfusion can have a blood type and antibody screen performed. This includes ABO and Rh(D) type as well as a screen for antibodies capable of causing hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100639\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100639 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100638 \">figure 2</a>), including those of the ABO, Rh, Duffy, Kidd, Kell, SsU, and Lutheran blood group systems. (See <a href=\"#H645806\" class=\"local\">'ABO and Rh(D) type'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3796831\" class=\"local\">'Antibody screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crossmatching is performed when a crossmatch or release of a RBC unit is requested. (See <a href=\"#H3796845\" class=\"local\">'Compatibility testing (crossmatch)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a patient with a negative antibody screen and no history of clinically significant antibodies, an RBC unit often can be released to the recipient following a negative electronic or immediate spin crossmatch. (See <a href=\"#H645946\" class=\"local\">'Electronic crossmatch'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1450825\" class=\"local\">'Immediate spin crossmatch'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a patient with a positive antibody screen or a history of RBC antibodies, additional testing that includes indirect antiglobulin testing (indirect Coombs testing) is used to ensure that RBCs in the selected unit do not express the antigen(s). (See <a href=\"#H360735\" class=\"local\">'IgG crossmatch (full crossmatch)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For some patients, interpretation of the results of the antibody screen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crossmatching may be more challenging, and additional testing may be needed. Potential confounding conditions include autoimmune or drug-induced hemolytic anemia, hemolytic transfusion reaction, recent transfusion of ABO incompatible plasma or platelets, or massive transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H1449669\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of pretransfusion testing results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional aspects of pretransfusion testing and crossmatching may apply to certain patients, including infants less than four months of age, pregnant individuals, individuals with sickle cell disease, and those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99896 \">table 2</a>).
