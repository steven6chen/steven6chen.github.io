Originally offered to women with primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure) or those who had genetic diseases who did not want to transmit the gene defect to their offspring, donated oocytes are now used by women with many reproductive disorders and commonly by women in later reproductive years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 20,000 attempts at pregnancy using in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donated oocytes or embryos are initiated annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Oocyte donation is, at present, the only effective therapy for the treatment of infertility in women with ovarian failure and for the vast majority of women of advanced reproductive age. Details of the IVF procedure are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first pregnancies from oocyte and embryo donation were reported in women in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Recipients had normal ovarian hormonal secretion, and the natural cycles of the donor and recipients were synchronized.</p><p>Soon thereafter, a successful pregnancy was achieved in a woman with ovarian failure, who required estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> to prepare the endometrium to receive the ovum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Estrogen and progesterone were administered in a manner that mimicked the natural ovulatory cycle prior to conception and were continued through the first trimester to support the developing pregnancy.</p><p>During the next few years, refinements in oocyte donation continued, and efficacy improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].

Today, birth rates exceeding 50 percent per embryo transfer are typically reported in women in their 40s and 50s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>], suggesting that the decreased fecundity and increased pregnancy wastage associated with aging was due to problems with the ovary (oocyte) rather than the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59102 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7226236\"><span class=\"h2\">Current trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an analysis of United States donor oocyte cycle data from the years 2000 to 2010, reported by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System (NASS), there was an increase in the annual number of donor oocyte cycles from 10,801 to 18,306 and an overall increase in good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, these women, who often have cardiovascular anomalies, have a high rate of cardiovascular mortality during pregnancy due to aortic dissection. Therefore, before attempting to become pregnant, women with Turner syndrome should undergo a complete medical evaluation, with particular attention paid to cardiovascular and renal function, as recommended by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome#H1406037214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Management of fertility and pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H684709472\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced reproductive age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the majority of women undergoing IVF with donor oocytes are women of advanced reproductive age, a population at higher risk for pregnancy complications, particularly in the setting of multiple gestation. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that only one to two embryos be transferred to recipients, in order to minimize multiple gestation rates, while maintaining high pregnancy rates. In cases where high-quality blastocysts are obtained, a single embryo transfer should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30306521\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer survivors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvements in the treatments of pediatric and adult cancers has resulted in increased survival rates for many women with malignancies. However, the use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have detrimental effects on ovarian function, leading to impairment or even complete loss of reproductive capacity. As a result, cancer survivors have often used donor oocytes to achieve pregnancy. Patients receiving high doses of pelvic radiation (9 Gy and greater) are at particular risk for developing ovarian insufficiency and endometrial injury. However, a comparative analysis of 142 cancer survivors undergoing oocyte donation failed to demonstrate differences in pregnancy outcomes when compared with patients of similar age receiving oocyte donation treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, embryo transfers were performed only in women with an endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm on ultrasound following the use of prescribed estrogen. The authors cautioned that patients with endometrial atrophy or fibrosis secondary to radiation damage may not be candidates.</p><p>Cancer survivors have higher risk of pregnancy complications, including anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Like patients with Turner's syndrome, these patients would probably benefit from maternal-fetal medicine consultation prior to conception.

Not surprisingly, male partners of women undergoing oocyte donation are in a similar age group (over the age 40 or 50 years). Advanced paternal age may be associated with a decline in semen parameters (volume, motility, morphology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], infertility, increased spontaneous abortion, and offspring abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Although pregnancy outcomes remain favorable for oocyte donation, women over the age of 45 years appear to have a small but significant decrease in embryo implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live-birth rates compared with younger cohorts, which might be partially influenced by the sperm from their older partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In an analysis of over 1000 oocyte donation cycles adjusted for female recipient age, having a male partner over age 50 years was associated with a decrease in blastocyst formation and live-birth rates, and an increased rate of pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oocyte donors have usually been recruited in the community and traditionally been unknown to the recipient. In most metropolitan areas, oocyte donors are paid, with payments varying from USD $2500 to 10,000. Outside the United States, however, remuneration is frowned upon and is illegal in many places [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Matching a donor to a recipient is usually based upon phenotypic similarities between the women.</p><p>Occasionally, women offer to donate oocytes for a recipient known to them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other known donors are siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and, more rarely, daughters who have provided oocytes for their postmenopausal, remarried mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Most donor programs seek 21- to 34-year-old women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Some centers also prefer to use donors of proven fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This preference is based upon the premise that women who have not been pregnant may be infertile.</p><p>The screening of donors at most centers and recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine includes assessment of physical and mental health and risk for infectious diseases.</p><p>In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became responsible for regulating infectious disease testing of all oocyte donors. Serological tests for syphilis, hepatitis B core antibody and surface antigen and hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV-1)/type</span> 2 (HIV-2) infections are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Tests must be performed in a laboratory using tests that are FDA-approved for donor screening. Additionally, under the new guidelines, the physical exam and serum and cervical samples for gonorrhea and chlamydia must be performed within 30 days of oocyte retrieval. False-positive results exclude donor participation and retests or confirmatory status tests are not allowed to overturn false-positive results. Written documentation of eligibility for donation is now required to meet the FDA regulation.</p><p>The Zika virus, which is currently causing an ongoing outbreak in the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected <em>Aedes</em> mosquito but also via sexual contact, blood products, and organ or tissue transplantation. To avoid possible transmission of Zika virus infection, the FDA has issued donor deferral recommendations for hematopoietic stem cells, solid <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/tissues,</span> and donor gametes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Living donors with Zika virus infection or relevant epidemiologic exposure (residence in or travel to an area where mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus infection has been reported, or unprotected sexual contact with a person who meets these criteria) should be considered ineligible for oocyte donation for six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zika-virus-infection-an-overview#H1306359896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zika virus infection: An overview&quot;, section on 'Blood/tissue donation'</a>.)</p><p>Rh testing is also done, and the couple and donor commonly are Rh matched. Specific genetic testing is performed for patients and donors at risk for genetic illness, such as cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy in Caucasians, sickle cell trait in Blacks, and hemoglobinopathies in Asians.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584065701\"><span class=\"h1\">CURRENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oocyte donation is typically accomplished by synchronizing the menstrual cycle of the infertile woman with an ovarian-stimulated cycle of a donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75520\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75520 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443952\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520646\"><span class=\"h3\">Protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The donor undergoes the following procedures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins followed by monitoring of the follicular response. The latter is usually accomplished by serial measurements of serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> and frequent transvaginal ultrasonography of the ovaries. The exact stimulation protocol may vary from center to center. In general, there has been a shift to protocols that are associated with a lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome#H779501460\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&quot;, section on 'Ovarian stimulation protocol'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oocyte recovery is performed by transvaginal, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82492\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82492 \">figure 4</a>). Oocytes are then fertilized in vitro by sperm provided by the recipient (ie, husband, partner, or sperm bank). In the case of &quot;shared egg donation,&quot; retrieved oocytes are usually divided equally among the parties in order to produce enough embryos for transfer (one to two embryos per transfer) to each of the recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Multiple gestation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520668\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedural risks and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women should be informed that there is a risk, albeit low, of potential complications when donating oocytes. The risk of complications (approximately 1 percent) in the donor is similar to that of infertile women who undergo the same procedure, and includes anesthetic accidents, hemorrhage, infection, and development of OHSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 587 donors undergoing 973 cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and 886 oocyte retrievals, the rate of serious complications (OHSS, ovarian torsion, infections, ruptured ovarian cyst) was 6 in 886 (0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The incidence of other complications serious enough to seek medical attention (mild to moderate OHSS, ovarian cysts, intraabdominal bleeding, hematoma) was 8.5 percent. The cycle cancellation rate was 9 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar rates and types of complications were seen in a second report of 1917 oocyte donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential risk of the donor developing OHSS may be reduced by measuring antral follicle counts (AFC) and serum anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]; lower gonadotropin doses should be chosen for donors with high serum AMH concentrations or AFC. Further safeguards now include the use of gonadotropin-releasing antagonists rather than agonists for downregulating the pituitary prior to stimulating the ovaries. In addition, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist can be used to trigger ovulation instead of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in cycles where there is concern for OHSS. The &quot;Lupron trigger&quot; protocol has reduced OHSS to under 1 percent of stimulated cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

There were no associations between obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and pregnancy rates, miscarriage, or live-birth rates. There was significant heterogeneity among studies for clinical pregnancy rates, with one report showing a beneficial effect of obesity on pregnancy rates. However, when the meta-analysis was performed either with or without the study showing a benefit of obesity, the conclusion was the same: Obesity was not associated with adverse reproductive outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2077008584\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational hypertension occurs more frequently in women with donor oocyte pregnancies compared with IVF with autologous oocyte pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-56</a>]. It was initially thought that the older age of the women undergoing donor oocyte might explain some of the increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>]. However, in several studies of age-matched groups of pregnant women who had undergone IVF with either donor or autologous oocytes, an excess risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia was still observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/52,53,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53,55-57</a>]. One possible mechanism for the increase in risk is that foreign antigens on trophoblastic tissue could trigger an autoimmune response in the mother.</p><p>Evidence of immune-modulated vasculitis affecting the decidua, placental bed, and spiral arteries has been described as commonplace in recipient pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The exaggerated rates of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders and observed fetal growth restriction, particularly in women over the age of 45 years, may be a result of maladaptation in the normal immunological response to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H684709506\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the apparent increase in hypertensive problems associated with pregnancy following oocyte donation, the outcomes are generally very good.

In addition, multiple gestations are very common (over 40 percent of pregnancies), further complicating obstetric care. Therefore, it remains important to emphasize to all recipients, particularly women of advanced reproductive age (&gt;40 years), the value of a single embryo transfer in an effort to lower the risk of multiple gestation.</p><p>Outcome continues to be relatively good in women over the age of 45 to 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. One study of 101 consecutive pregnancies in women ages 50 to 59 years reported the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Singleton births occurred in 74, twins in 24, triplets in three pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average birth weight was 3029, 2362, and 1357 g for singletons, twins, and triplets, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average delivery time was at 37, 35, and 30 weeks for singletons, twins, and triplets, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antenatal complications occurred in 40 women, but rates were similar to those seen in a younger cohort of recipients also undergoing egg donation.

In 1991, pregnancy in a functionally agonadal woman was reported using immature oocytes obtained from surgically excised ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Others have successfully retrieved oocytes from natural cycles, maturing and fertilizing the eggs in vitro using culture media enriched with follicular fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Several pregnancies resulted using these oocytes donated from unstimulated ovaries.</p><p>Other possibilities for increasing the donor pool have been investigated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Live births in mice have occurred following the transplantation of cryopreserved autologous ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to retrieve immature oocytes from mouse embryos and culture them in vitro for purposes of oocyte donation to recipient animals has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Oocytes procured from electively aborted fetuses could be similarly used as a source of donor eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cadaver ovaries donated for medical use, similar to other organ grafts, have also been suggested as a source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p>The use of either fetal oocytes or cadaver ovaries raises important ethical issues, which would need to be resolved before considering such an approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryopreservation of oocytes and egg banks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vast improvements in cryopreservation of oocytes have occurred in recent years, which make possible the banking of eggs. Successful oocyte freezing and thawing promises to simplify the current approach to egg donation using freshly harvested gametes since it obviates the need for synchronization of recipients, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Furthermore, meeting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for the testing of donors within a 30-day window prior to egg retrieval would be easier to manage if donors did not need to be synchronized to the recipients. Following cryopreservation, eggs may be stored locally and shipped to distant locations when needed. Thus, eggs, still considered to be in short supply, can be maximally resourced. Finally, reducing the cryopreservation of large numbers of supernumerary embryos produced through conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) methodology would lessen ethical concerns over the disposition of unused embryos that often result from donor egg cycles. This approach has demonstrated success in several series reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p>Cryopreserved donor oocytes are now available and are increasingly used for assisted reproduction cycles. A survey of American clinics reported that commercial egg banks (CEBs) were the most commonly used resource using primarily vitrification and allocating approximately six eggs per recipient. In this survey, pregnancy rates were similar to those reported using traditional methodology but at a lower cost to recipients and with less need to freeze supernumerary embryos.</p><p>Although a minority of the 17,697 cycles of oocyte donation reported to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) in 2009 used eggs from a frozen egg bank (believed to be approximately 1500 cycles), the early reports of success will likely result in more widespread acceptance and use. However, there are important concerns about the role of CEBs in assisted reproductive technology (ART) because the industry remains unregulated and critics have focused on the perception of buying and selling human eggs and the commodification of reproductive tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age#H14894574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preserving options for women of advancing age&quot;, section on 'Cryopreservation of oocytes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326229170\"><span class=\"h3\">Cryopreserved versus fresh oocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the survey of CEBs reported similar pregnancy rates for cryopreserved and fresh donor oocyte cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], this was not observed in a second study of 11,000 oocyte donation cycles, of which 20 percent used cryopreserved oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The live-birth rate per transfer for cryopreserved oocyte cycles was lower than fresh oocyte cycles (47 versus 56 percent, respectively). Although the live-birth rate for cryopreserved oocytes was lower in this report, the efficiency and lower cost of cryopreserved donor oocytes make it a reasonable and attractive option. Of note, the second study was based upon 2013, not 2015, data from the SART; it is anticipated that outcomes with cryopreserved oocytes will improve over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584065203\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p>Oocyte (egg) donation is an important part of modern assisted reproductive care. Originally offered only to women with primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure) or those who had genetic diseases who did not want to transmit the gene defect to their offspring, donated oocytes are now also used for women with a variety of reproductive disorders as well as for postmenopausal women.
