These corticotroph tumors are almost always benign and are usually microadenomas (ie, &lt;10 mm in diameter). The progressive stages of treatment that may be required to cure a patient of Cushing's disease are shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76949\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76949 \">algorithm 1</a>). Our approach is largely consistent with the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Transsphenoidal microadenomectomy is currently the treatment of choice for Cushing's disease. A neurosurgeon with expertise in transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing's patients can achieve an initial cure rate of 80 to 90 percent with microadenomas but less than 60 percent with macroadenomas. A meta-analysis of 18 reports since 1995 showed an overall initial cure rate for micro- and macroadenomas combined of 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is important to recognize that patients who are initially &quot;cured&quot; should be considered to be in remission rather than cured as some will recur. Overall, remission from centers with less experience may be much lower, approaching only 50 percent long-term cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Therefore, we do <strong>not</strong> suggest this approach.</p><p>The failure of incomplete adrenalectomy is related to the ability of the adrenal remnant eventually to become hyperplastic. For the same reason, total adrenalectomy with subcutaneous adrenal autotransplantation is likely to fail; three of eight patients treated with this technique developed recurrent Cushing's syndrome in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362181891\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laparoscopic approach, which can be done via either the anterior or posterior approaches, has become standard, as hospital stays appear to be shorter (usually one to five days) and complications fewer, as compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

Generally, the dose is tapered rapidly to 50 and then 25 mg IV every eight hours over the next two days. This dose provides both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid coverage. By the third postoperative day, most patients are able to take oral replacement doses of hydrocortisone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>). A daily dose of 15 to 25 mg hydrocortisone or its equivalent is thought to be optimal glucocorticoid replacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78904 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>).

Most changes were noted within three years of surgery. Only four of these patients developed a macroadenoma, and only one presented pituitary apoplexy. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with a shorter duration of Cushing's syndrome and higher postoperative plasma corticotropin (ACTH) concentrations were more likely to develop tumor progression.</p><p>Nelson syndrome was defined in an earlier era using sellar radiograms as the association of an enlarging pituitary tumor with progressive hyperpigmentation caused by very high plasma ACTH concentrations after bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-or-recurrent-cushings-disease-surgical-adrenalectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The progressive stages of treatment that may be required to cure a patient of Cushing's disease are shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76949\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76949 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, for patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease, adrenalectomy, which can be achieved either surgically or medically (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>), is sometimes recommended for definitive cure. (See <a href=\"#H1240291812\" class=\"local\">'General approach to Cushing's disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary therapy of Cushing's disease: Transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest bilateral total surgical adrenalectomy as the definitive treatment for patients in whom rapid cure of hypercortisolism is necessary or when all other therapies have failed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H362181869\" class=\"local\">'Surgical adrenalectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laparoscopic approach, which can be done via either the anterior or posterior approaches, has become standard as hospital stays appear to be shorter (usually one to five days) and complications fewer, as compared with open surgery. (See <a href=\"#H362181891\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenalectomy-techniques#H5289309\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenalectomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Selection of operative approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cure should be confirmed by measuring serum or urine cortisol. Glucocorticoid coverage is similar to that for transsphenoidal surgery, except that, in addition to lifelong glucocorticoid replacement, mineralocorticoid replacement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> must also be begun soon after surgery. (See <a href=\"#H362181898\" class=\"local\">'Hormone replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A daily dose of 15 to 25 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (or its equivalent) may be optimal glucocorticoid replacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78904 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H362181898\" class=\"local\">'Hormone replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease may develop corticotroph tumor progression (Nelson syndrome). Nelson syndrome was defined in an earlier era using sellar radiograms as the association of an enlarging pituitary tumor with progressive hyperpigmentation caused by very high plasma ACTH concentrations after bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome. In addition to hyperpigmentation, other clinical manifestations due to the enlarging tumor were common, including headaches, visual field defects, and, sometimes, cranial nerve palsies. Most patients are now diagnosed at an earlier stage by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with smaller increases in tumor size (&gt;2 mm). Therefore, symptoms related to the tumor itself are somewhat less common, but increased ACTH levels and hyperpigmentation are still important clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H362181912\" class=\"local\">'Nelson syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticotroph tumor progression occurs in 8 to 49 percent of adults and in over 50 percent of children with Cushing's disease who undergo total surgical adrenalectomy without prior pituitary irradiation. (See <a href=\"#H362181912\" class=\"local\">'Nelson syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest pituitary irradiation before adrenalectomy in patients with Cushing's disease with radiologically detectable residual corticotroph tumor. (See <a href=\"#H2714456616\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the tumor in a patient with Nelson syndrome becomes large enough to expand the sella, it is locally invasive, difficult to cure, and exhibits characteristics of a pituitary carcinoma. As a result, adrenalectomized patients should be followed indefinitely with MRI of the pituitary and measurements of basal and dexamethasone-suppressed plasma ACTH. (See <a href=\"#H362181940\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop Nelson syndrome, we suggest early transsphenoidal surgery (before the tumor becomes a macroadenoma) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H362181940\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression of Nelson syndrome tumors may occur even after pituitary surgery. Therefore, for patients with persistent Cushing's disease who have clear evidence of residual tumor after pituitary surgery, we suggest postoperative irradiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The type of radiation chosen is typically dictated by availability, cost, and patient preference regarding treatment time. (See <a href=\"#H362181940\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without visible residual tumor, we do not recommend preventive radiotherapy but perform regular MRI and ACTH measurements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, medical therapy is ineffective for the treatment of Nelson syndrome, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, an alkylating agent, which was reported to be effective in cases of aggressive macroadenomas. Further data on temozolomide are required before this drug can be recommended in this setting.
