In the typical patient with untreated AF, the ventricular rate can reach 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> or higher.</p><p>The use of pharmacologic therapies to achieve rate control in AF will be reviewed here. Nonpharmacologic therapies for rate control in AF are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Nonpharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2565334\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two established reasons to prevent a rapid ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of hemodynamic instability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition, there is some evidence to suggest a mortality benefit from rate control. In a large, population-based cohort study in Taiwan, mortality in individuals receiving beta blockers (43,879), nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (18,466), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (38,898) was compared with mortality in individuals not taking a rate control drug. Patients were excluded if they were taking more than one rate slowing drug. After adjustment for baseline differences, the risk of death was lower in patients receiving beta blockers (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.74-0.78) and calcium channel blockers (adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.96). However, the risk of death was higher in the group receiving digoxin (adjusted HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.14). We recommend caution in applying to clinical practice the findings in this non-randomized study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a rapid ventricular response involves two decisions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining the urgency of initial therapy (eg, intravenous versus oral rate control therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immediate versus elective cardioversion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choosing between a rate control and a rhythm control strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These decisions are not independent, and the options are not mutually exclusive. As an example, a patient for whom rate control may be the appropriate long-term strategy may require urgent cardioversion in the acute setting due to hemodynamic instability. On the other hand, a patient for whom a chronic rhythm control strategy is chosen may require initial rate control for three to four weeks to permit appropriate anticoagulation prior to cardioversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Treatment issues'</a>.)</p><p>When a rate control strategy is chosen, most patients can be successfully managed with pharmacologic therapy. Selection of an appropriate regimen is guided by an understanding of the determinants of the ventricular rate in AF and a structured method for assessing the adequacy of rate control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of ventricular rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During AF, electrical activity in the atria can exceed 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The majority of these impulses do not conduct to the ventricles because of the electrical properties of the atrioventricular (AV) node. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation#H8804432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Role of the atrioventricular node'</a>.)</p><p>AV nodal tissue consists of so-called &quot;slow response&quot; fibers. In most myocardial tissue, the initial depolarizing phase of the action potential (phase 0) is mediated by rapid sodium channels. In contrast, in the slow response fibers of the AV node, phase 0 is mediated by an inward calcium current, which uses a kinetically slow channel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relatively slow kinetics of the inward calcium current limits conduction velocity through the AV node, and therefore the ventricular rate during AF. In addition to these intrinsic properties, the AV node is also richly supplied and affected by both components of the autonomic nervous system. AV conduction is enhanced by sympathetic fibers and slowed by parasympathetic fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75699 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In the typical patient with untreated AF, the ventricular rate during the day varies between 90 and 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The ventricular rate may be slower (eg, less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min)</span> in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased vagal tone.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs that affect AV nodal conduction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV nodal disease, which should be suspected if the ventricular rate is below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> in the absence of a drug that slows AV conduction.</p><p/><p>A ventricular rate above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> suggests one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catecholamine excess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasympathetic withdrawal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An accessory pathway as occurs in the preexcitation syndrome.

Achieving rates similar to those recommended for patients in sinus rhythm with heart disease has been advocated: resting heart rate &le;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> and &le;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> during moderate exercise such as with the six-minute walk. Goals similar to these were used in many of the trials of rate versus rhythm control, such as AFFIRM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This issue was directly addressed in the RACE II trial, which randomly assigned 614 physically active patients with permanent AF to either a lenient rate control strategy (resting heart rate &lt;110 beats per minute) or a strict rate control strategy (resting heart rate &lt;80 beats per minute and heart rate during moderate exercise &lt;110 beats per minute) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmic events. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to the three-year estimated cumulative incidence of the primary outcome, lenient control was non-inferior to strict rate control (12.9 versus 14.9 percent, respectively; hazard ratio 0.84; 90% CI 0.58-1.21).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the lenient and strict rate control groups, 98 and 75 percent of patients, respectively, met their resting heart rate target. This target required use of more than one rate slowing agent (AV blocking) in 30 and 69 percent of patients, respectively. When the data were analyzed from the end of the dose-adjustment phase until the end of follow-up (median 2.9 years), the average heart rates in the lenient control group, strict control group patients who met the target, and strict control group patients who failed to meet the target were significantly different at 93, 72, and 86 beats per minute, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome (12.1 versus 14.2 versus 15 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were nearly nine times as many visits (684 versus 75) to achieve rate the control target(s) in those assigned to strict control. Rate control was &ldquo;stricter&rdquo; than anticipated in the lenient control group. Though the target rate was less than 110 beats per minute at rest, mean resting rates in this group at the after one year, two years, and at the end of follow-up were 86+15, 84+14, and 85+14 beats per minute, respectively. By comparison, mean resting rates in the strict control group were 75+12, 75+12, and 76+14 beats per minute, respectively. &#160;</p><p/><p>The results of the RACE II trial must be tempered given that the lenient control group was in fact treated more aggressively than the protocol required. In addition, RACE II included only patients with permanent AF, so extrapolation to patients with paroxysmal AF is difficult. </p><p>Based upon the results of the RACE II trial, we believe that achieving strict heart rate control may not be necessary in many physically active patients with AF who are minimally symptomatic. A more lenient rate control strategy offers the advantages of less medication (fewer drug side effects, lower cost) and fewer outpatient visits to achieve heart rate control. For patients in whom a lenient strategy is chosen, we suggest a goal of less than 85 beats per minute (85 beats per minute was the mean in the lenient group in RACE II).</p><p>The prevention of symptoms during normal activities or exercise is a primary goal of therapy. It is important to consider that symptoms may be due to either inadequate rate control or relative bradycardia (eg, in patients with tachy-brady syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, for those patients in whom a lenient strategy is chosen but who remain symptomatic, an attempt should be made to decrease symptoms by setting a lower rate goal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Documenting rate control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In practice, the efficacy of heart rate control therapy can be assessed by measurement of both the resting heart rate and use of either a six-minute walk test (at moderate exercise) or submaximal or maximal exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing. A 24-hour ambulatory monitor can also be used to evaluate efficacy. For young active patients, we recommend either an exercise ECG test or a Holter during exercise. For older or sedentary patients, measuring heart rate after walking briskly around the office or up stairs may provide sufficient information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537237617\"><span class=\"h3\">Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistently increased ventricular rates in AF have been associated with a left ventricular cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While this issue has not been well studied, we believe that this phenomenon is unlikely to occur if the ventricular rate is kept below 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> which is the recommended heart rate goal. Some experts perform an echocardiogram every two to three years in asymptomatic patients with higher average ventricular rates while others do not. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Urgency of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with new or recurrent AF with a rapid ventricular response, the intensity of initial therapy depends upon the clinical scenario:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergent therapy &ndash; In patients who are clinically or hemodynamically unstable (eg, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, hypotension) due to AF and a rapid ventricular response, treatment options include intravenous rate control medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immediate cardioversion. In patients with an adequate blood pressure, pharmacologic rate control with intravenous calcium channel blockers or beta blockers may be attempted, while arrangements are made for cardioversion. If the patient responds to rate control therapy but remains unstable, an explanation other than AF with a rapid ventricular response should be sought.

However, the expected advantages of rhythm control were not confirmed in AFFIRM, RACE, and other randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. As a result, a rate control strategy is now preferred in most asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The data supporting this conclusion are discussed in detail separately.

Thus, it is particularly important to assess heart rate with exertion in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> alone.</p><p>In a small crossover study of 12 patients with chronic AF, patients were treated for two-week intervals with five different drug regimens: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> 0.25 mg daily, diltiazem-CD 240 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> 50 mg daily, digoxin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, and digoxin plus atenolol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Digoxin plus atenolol was the most effective regimen for controlling the mean ventricular rate and reducing the peak heart rate during exercise; digoxin and diltiazem as single agents were the least effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73989\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73989 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">AFFIRM trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among evaluations of rate control drugs, the study with the largest sample size and longest follow-up is a post-hoc analysis from the AFFIRM trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In AFFIRM, which compared rate control and rhythm control strategies, 2027 patients were randomly assigned to the rate control arm. Adequate rate control at rest and exercise was defined according to predetermined criteria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Rate control goals'</a> above.)</p><p>The overall effectiveness (meeting both rest and exertion goals) of initial therapy was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker alone &ndash; 59 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium channel blocker alone &ndash; 38 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> alone &ndash; 58 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> &ndash; 68 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium channel blocker plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> &ndash; 60 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker plus calcium channel blocker &ndash; 59 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker plus calcium channel blocker plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> &ndash; 76 percent</p><p/><p>At five-year follow-up, adequate rate control increased from approximately 60 to 80 percent of patients. Only 58 percent of patients had adequate rate control with the first drug or combination used. Patients initially treated with a beta blocker were significantly less likely than those treated with calcium channel blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> to have their drug regimen changed.</p><p>Several important limitations to this study need to be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once randomized to the rate control arm of the trial, drug selection was not randomized. There were significant differences between patients treated with different regimens; beta blockers were more commonly used in patients with coronary disease, calcium channel blockers were more often given to patients with pulmonary disease and to women, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> was used more often in patients with cardiomyopathy and in nonwhite patients. Whether these baseline differences had an impact on the adequacy of rate control is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 361 (18 percent) of the patients assigned to the rate control strategy had an initial assessment of the adequacy of rate control at rest and with exertion. This is because many patients spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm (and therefore, rate control could not be assessed), and also because of the limited number of patients in atrial fibrillation (AF) who had heart rate assessed with exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Systematic review</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review of the overall management of AF included a discussion of 54 trials that evaluated 17 different agents used for rate control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The studies were all relatively small (6 to 239 patients), and had follow-up periods of eight weeks or less. Most compared single agents to placebo. Due to extensive variability in methods and outcome assessments, a summary analysis of the trials could not be performed. However, the following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, and most beta blockers (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">timolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pindolol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>) were all effective in reducing the ventricular rate during rest and exercise. The beta blockers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, xamoterol, and celiprolol were less effective at rest, but did reduce ventricular rates during exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> to placebo reported inconsistent results, particularly when heart during exercise was assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> with a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker reduced heart rate both at rest and with exertion.</p><p/><p>Thus, pharmacologic therapy can achieve adequate rate control in approximately 80 percent of patients. However, achieving this goal requires close monitoring, medication adjustments, and often combination therapy. Although there are differences in the efficacy of the various drugs, it is likely that monitoring and adjustments to therapy are more important components of successful rate control strategies than is the initial drug selection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef75491 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24917938\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

A discussion of the relative risks and benefits of rate versus rhythm control strategies is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Rhythm versus rate control'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute rate control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with AF and a rapid ventricular response, acute heart rate control is usually achieved with intravenous medications. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Urgency of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>In such patients, we suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients without significant heart failure or hypotension, we suggest intravenous beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Acute control with beta blockers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Acute control with calcium channel blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, using the regimen described above, is our preferred drug in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Acute control with calcium channel blockers'</a> above.) However, comparative data are limited and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or intravenous beta blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> are reasonable alternatives (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Comparative efficacy'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If it is uncertain whether such therapy will be tolerated by the patient, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> may be cautiously administered since its very short half-life permits a therapeutic trial to be performed at reduced risk. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Acute control with beta blockers'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not adequately respond to initial therapy with either an intravenous beta blocker or intravenous calcium channel blocker, we suggest the addition of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> as the second drug in combination therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Digoxin'</a> above.) Some patients have a greater degree of rate control with a beta blocker than with a calcium channel blocker, and vice versa. Thus, in patients who have an inadequate response to one of these drugs, switching to a drug from the other class is an alternative to adding digoxin. <br/><br/>If rate control is achieved, we try to use the second drug as a single agent and to avoid using beta blockers and calcium channel blockers as combination therapy for rate control. However, in selected patients who do not have hypotension or significant left ventricular dysfunction, these classes may be used together, and in some cases all three agents (ie, a beta blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and digoxin) may be necessary to achieve adequate rate control. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with advanced HF or significant hypotension, we suggest intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Digoxin'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not respond to or are intolerant of intravenous calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, we suggest intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> for acute control of the ventricular rate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Amiodarone'</a> above.) In such patients, the use of amiodarone for rate control is a short-term strategy (eg, hours to days). The drug should not be used if pre-excitation is present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic rate control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using drugs that block atrioventricular (AV) conduction, at least 75 percent of AF patients can achieve a rate control target of &le;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> and over 90 percent a target of &le;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. However, achieving this goal requires close monitoring, medication adjustments, and often combination therapy. In such patients, adjustments can often be made in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Urgency of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Rate control goals'</a> above.)</p><p>Although there are differences in the efficacy of the various drugs used for rate control, it is likely that monitoring and adjustments to therapy are more important components of successful rate control strategies than is the initial drug selection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef75491 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a rate control goal of &lt;85 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> for <strong>symptomatic </strong>patients in AF in whom a rate control strategy has been chosen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who continue with unacceptable symptoms at this goal, an attempt should be made to see if a lower rate goal lessens symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Rate control goals'</a> above.) For <strong>asymptomatic </strong>patients with permanent AF, a more lenient rate control goal of &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> may be reasonable, as long as patients do not develop LV dysfunction. Careful monitoring for symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> development of LV dysfunction is imperative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who require chronic rate control therapy, we suggest initial therapy with an oral beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Chronic beta blocker therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chronic calcium channel blocker therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta blockers are preferred in patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, and in patients in whom the ventricular rate increases inappropriately during exercise. In the first two settings, beta blockers improve patient survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Despite these advantages, beta blockers are contraindicated or relatively contraindicated in some patients, and others cannot tolerate the side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is preferred in patients with chronic lung disease and in patients who do not tolerate a beta blocker. Among the calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> has a somewhat greater blocking effect on the AV node than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, and the choice between these drugs is often dictated by side effects. Diltiazem may be preferred in patients with mild heart failure if a beta blocker is contraindicated or not tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have inadequate rate control on maximum-tolerated doses of either a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker, we suggest the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Digoxin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2274660883\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not achieve adequate rate control on maximum-tolerated doses of a beta blocker and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker together, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> if atrioventricular nodal ablation, pharmacologic rhythm control, or catheter ablation of AF is not being considered (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Careful follow-up for side effects such as bradycardia is imperative. (See <a href=\"#H2274660883\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.)Some patients will not achieve adequate heart rate control with pharmacologic therapy due to poor response to or intolerance of the medications.
