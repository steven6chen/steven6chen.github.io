One in nine women will undergo surgery for prolapse or incontinence by age 80 years, and 30 percent of these women will require an additional prolapse surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Reconstructive surgery corrects the prolapsed vagina and aims to restore normal anatomy, while obliterative surgery corrects prolapse by removing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> closing off all or a portion of the vaginal canal (colpocleisis) to reduce the viscera back into the pelvis. Most women with symptomatic POP are treated with a reconstructive procedure. However, obliterative procedures are an effective option for women who cannot tolerate more extensive surgery and who are not planning future vaginal intercourse. In addition, obliterative procedures are consistently associated with high rates of satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Obliterative procedures for POP are reviewed here. Evaluation of women with POP, conservative management, and choosing a primary surgical procedure are discussed separately.

However, obliterative procedures are less invasive and better tolerated by frail, older women than reconstructive procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure#H2327205\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;, section on 'Candidates for surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Obliterative procedures are reserved for women who are not candidates for more extensive surgery or do not plan future vaginal intercourse. A study that surveyed older adults on their sexuality reported that the prevalence of sexual activity decreased with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sexual activity amongst women ages 57 to 64 was 62 percent and decreased to 17 percent in women ages 75 to 85. </p><p>In the appropriate population, the advantages of obliterative procedures compared with other types of POP surgery are that such procedures typically have a shorter operative duration, decreased perioperative morbidity, and an extremely low risk of prolapse recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. A retrospective cohort study of older women (median age 80) reported similar rates of patient satisfaction after obliterative versus reconstructive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The obvious disadvantages are the elimination of the potential for vaginal intercourse, as well as the inability to evaluate the cervix or uterus via a vaginal route (eg, cervical cytology or endometrial biopsy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396939\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POP often coexists with other pelvic floor symptoms. Similar to other reconstructive procedures, prior to recommending an obliterative procedure, surgeons should obtain a thorough pelvic floor history, including assessment of bothersome urinary symptoms (incontinence and voiding difficulties) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> defecatory problems. In addition, the symptoms specific to prolapse (eg, sensation of a vaginal bulge, irritation from ulceration of prolapse vaginal tissue) should be elicited. During the history and physical examination, the presence and severity of each of these disorders should be assessed, as this information may alter surgical decision making. </p><p>Aspects of preoperative evaluation and preparation that are specific to obliterative POP surgery are discussed in this section. General principles of evaluation of women undergoing POP repair are discussed in detail separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396946\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent and patient goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to discuss with the patient each symptom that is present and the effect on her quality of life. This helps to set goals for reconstructive surgery and assess postoperative improvement. Studies have demonstrated that patient satisfaction after POP surgery correlates highly with achievement of self-described preoperative surgical goals, but poorly with objective outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p>Informed consent for obliterative POP surgery should include a discussion of the risks of surgery and loss of the ability to have future vaginal intercourse. Since many women develop stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following correction of apical prolapse, it is particularly important to discuss this risk and whether preventive surgery should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H25884270\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant stress urinary incontinence surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in women: Combined surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Detecting occult incontinence'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396953\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms should be reviewed that are related to POP and to associated urinary or anal incontinence. Women with POP may experience a bulge or protrusion from the vagina. Protrusion of the vagina may result in chronic discharge, vaginal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding from ulceration. Other symptoms may include pelvic pressure, urinary retention, or constipation; some women have the need to reduce the prolapse using a finger in the vagina (ie, splint) to urinate or defecate. </p><p>Medical comorbidities should be reviewed and preoperative medical consultation obtained if appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396960\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough speculum and bimanual pelvic examination are performed. The findings of the examination should be recorded using a quantitative and reproducible method for recording POP. The system currently recommended by the International Continence Society and the American Urogynecologic Society is the pelvic organ prolapse quantitation (POP-Q) system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74368 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57450 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Prolapse assessment should be done with the prolapse maximally everted and all vaginal compartments assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396967\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of urinary dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POP frequently coexists with urinary incontinence or urinary retention, and women planning apical prolapse repair should be evaluated for these conditions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7777852\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with stage II or greater apical prolapse remain continent despite loss of anterior vaginal and <span class=\"nowrap\">bladder/urethral</span> support. However, 13 to 65 percent of continent women develop symptoms of SUI after surgical correction of the prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. A retrospective study of women who underwent colpocleisis reported that 8 of 30 developed de novo SUI postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This likely occurs because the prolapse kinks and obstructs the urethra; this obstruction is alleviated when the prolapse is repaired. This is referred to as &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;potential&quot; stress incontinence. The decision to perform a prophylactic continence procedure at the time of colpocleisis remains unclear; however, several small case series suggest that concomitant midurethral sling at the time of colpocleisis is safe and does not result in high rates of urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Continent women undergoing colpocleisis should be counseled regarding the risks and benefits of prophylactic continence procedures versus staged procedures. Consideration should be given to evaluating these women preoperatively with reduced stress testing, although reduction testing does not accurately predict postoperative SUI (approximately 40 percent of women with negative testing will develop postoperative stress incontinence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This testing may impact surgical decision making, particularly for women undergoing transvaginal apical prolapse repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in women: Combined surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Detecting occult incontinence'</a>.)</p><p>Women with bothersome SUI should be counseled regarding a concomitant procedure for SUI, regardless of preoperative urinary retention. In a case series of 38 women with POP and SUI undergoing colpocleisis and midurethral sling, 11 women had preoperative urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Ten of 11 women with preoperative retention had resolution of retention and no women experienced prolonged retention requiring sling release after surgery, suggesting it is reasonable to offer women with POP and bothersome SUI midurethral sling at the time of colpocleisis. In contrast, rectus fascial sling is associated with a three-fold increase in reoperation for postoperative retention when performed at the time of colpocleisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7777859\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume should be determined within 10 minutes of voiding. In general, a PVR of less than 50 mL is considered adequate emptying, and a PVR of greater than 200 mL is considered inadequate. Older women with advanced POP are at increased risk for urinary retention, which, in rare cases, may result in hydronephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25884254\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25884299\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a type of obliterative procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All colpocleisis procedures remove vaginal epithelium and then appose the anterior and posterior vaginal muscularis. Apposing the anterior and posterior vaginal walls inverts the prolapsed apex and the sutured tissue forms a column of pelvic support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The two most common techniques for obliterative surgery for POP are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial colpocleisis (Le Fort colpocleisis) &ndash; Partial (Le Fort) colpocleisis is done in patients in whom the uterus is left in situ and includes removal of strips of anterior and posterior vaginal epithelium, leaving a small strip of lateral epithelium on each side. The primary purpose for leaving the lateral strips of epithelium is to provide an outlet for cervical or uterine bleeding or drainage in patients where the uterus is left in situ. However, some surgeons leave the lateral epithelium to help orient junior surgeons when learning the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total colpocleisis &ndash; Total colpocleisis is generally reserved for vaginal vault prolapse and refers to removal of the majority of the vaginal epithelium. This procedure is also referred to as complete colpocleisis, colpectomy, or vaginectomy.</p><p/><p>Whether performing a partial or total colpocleisis, 3 to 4 cm of distal vaginal epithelium should be left in place to avoid placing traction on the posterior urethra when suturing the anterior and posterior vaginal muscularis. This distal traction on the posterior urethral and bladder neck may increase SUI postoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25884262\"><span class=\"h2\">Concomitant hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concomitant hysterectomy is often performed at the time of POP surgery, despite case series data that suggest that hysterectomy performed at the time of colpocleisis increases operative duration and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/12,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27,28</a>]. In a retrospective study of 92 women who underwent total colpocleisis, concomitant hysterectomy was associated with significant increases in operative duration (an average of 52 minutes longer) and transfusion rate (35 versus 13 percent) compared with no hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A study from the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database of over 1000 women undergoing colpocleisis reported an overall serious complication rate of 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, the rate was notably higher for women who underwent concomitant hysterectomy compared with those who underwent colpocleisis only (3.7 versus 0.7 percent). Obliterative surgery is highly effective, regardless of whether hysterectomy is performed.</p><p>Some surgeons routinely recommend concomitant hysterectomy because obliterative procedures preclude future evaluation of the cervix or uterus (eg, cervical cytology or endometrial biopsy). Hysterectomy also prevents future pyometra, but this complication is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. However, the increased morbidity associated with concomitant hysterectomy does not offset rare <span class=\"nowrap\">uterine/cervical</span> complications. Women with a uterus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cervix should undergo preoperative evaluation of the cervix and endometrium (cervical cytology and endometrial sampling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transvaginal ultrasound) when indicated prior to obliterative procedures without concomitant hysterectomy.</p><p>Hysterectomy may be advisable in women with risk factors for cervical cancer (eg, current or recent high risk human papillomavirus infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) or endometrial cancer (eg, obesity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> use, Lynch syndrome), although there are no studies evaluating obliterative procedures in these groups.

Approximately 3 to 4 cm of epithelium on the distal anterior vaginal wall should be left in place to avoid pulling the posterior urethra down when suturing the anterior and posterior vagina. The urethrovaginal junction can be easily identified by placing gentle traction on the Foley catheter and palpating the balloon. The urethrovesical junction can then be marked with a sterile skin marker to prevent over dissection of the epithelium in this area. </p><p>Finally, a wide perineorrhaphy is created by removing a large diamond shaped area of perineal skin and distal vaginal epithelium.

Complication rates and ICU admissions were lower when women had their colpocleisis in a high-volume center (one that did more than 11 colpocleisis procedures per year) by a urogynecologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Significant postoperative complications are often related to comorbidities in an elderly population; postoperative cardiac, thromboembolic, pulmonary, or cerebrovascular events occur in approximately two percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/8,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,38</a>]. Four percent of patients experience complications related to the procedure itself, eg, transfusion or pyelonephritis; these events occur mostly when concomitant hysterectomy is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/8,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27</a>]. Less frequently, complications include ongoing vaginal bleeding, fever and intraoperative ureteral injury. In a retrospective review of 245 women undergoing colpocleisis, the most common adverse event was urinary tract infection, which occurred in 35 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23451578\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colpocleisis is highly effective for treating prolapse; success rates range from 90 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/4,9-13,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-13,40</a>]. As an example, a large retrospective study (n = 310) found that 93 percent of women who underwent colpocleisis reported their symptoms were cured or greatly improved. The complication rate was 15 percent; most complications were minor, but four deaths occurred (two cases of postoperative pulmonary embolisms, one myocardial infarction 42 days after surgery, one case of sepsis related to a bowel injury during a concomitant procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In over 90 percent of women with urinary retention undergoing colpocleisis, urinary retention resolves after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Colpocleisis does not appear to alter body image and regret after the procedure is uncommon (ranging from than 0 to 13 percent) and not related to patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis/abstract/6,12,27,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,27,43-46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3586365\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obliterative surgery treats pelvic organ prolapse (POP) by removing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> closing off all or a portion of the vaginal canal (colpocleisis) to reduce the vagina and viscera back into the pelvis. While most women with symptomatic POP are treated with a reconstructive procedure, obliterative procedures are an effective option for women who cannot tolerate more extensive surgery and who are not planning future vaginal intercourse. (See <a href=\"#H20396416\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial (Le Fort) colpocleisis is done in patients in whom the uterus is left in situ and involves removal of strips of anterior and posterior vaginal epithelium. The remaining lateral portions of epithelium are left in place, providing drainage tracts for uterine bleeding or discharge. Total colpocleisis (colpectomy) is typically done for vaginal vault prolapse, and the majority of the vaginal epithelium is removed. (See <a href=\"#H25884299\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a type of obliterative procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a uterus or cervix who are undergoing colpocleisis, we suggest partial colpocleisis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For women without a cervix or uterus, either partial or total colpocleisis may be performed. (See <a href=\"#H25884299\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a type of obliterative procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are undergoing colpocleisis and are at an average risk of cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endometrial cancer, we suggest NOT performing concomitant hysterectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Concomitant hysterectomy at the time of colpocleisis increases operative duration and morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H25884262\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women undergoing obliterative POP surgery often have symptomatic or occult stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Concomitant midurethral sling is appropriate in some women and does not seem to increase postoperative rates of urinary retention. (See <a href=\"#H25884270\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant stress urinary incontinence surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in women: Combined surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'POP with no symptoms of SUI'</a>.). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant postoperative complications of colpocleisis are often related to comorbidities in an elderly population. The most common complications related to the procedure itself are transfusion and pyelonephritis.

Colpocleisis does not appear to alter body image and regret after the procedure is uncommon (ranging from 0 to 13 percent).
