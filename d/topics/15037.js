Their contraction during part of the breathing cycle changes the anatomic configuration of the thorax and displaces its components, so that air moves into and out of the gas exchanging portion of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The importance of the respiratory musculature in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is underscored by diaphragmatic structural changes which render patients more resistant to fatigue, including an increased quantity of slow twitch fibers and slow isomers of myosin light chains, tropomyosin, and troponins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The effect of training and resting the respiratory muscles in patients with COPD will be presented here. An overview of the management of stable COPD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have demonstrated that respiratory muscle strength and endurance can be increased with specific training, similar to skeletal muscle training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. A sufficient stimulus, such as greater than 30 percent of maximal force, is needed for training to occur.</p><p>Since reduced inspiratory muscle strength is evident in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), considerable efforts have been made to define the role of respiratory muscle training in this setting. Theoretically, an increase in inspiratory muscle strength (and perhaps endurance) could result in improved respiratory muscle function. However, this may only be relevant when patients must handle inspiratory loads that are greater than baseline, such as during an acute exacerbation.</p><p>Inspiratory muscle training improved the six minute walk distance and reduced dyspnea in a study that compared expiratory, inspiratory, and combined training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis (32 trials), inspiratory muscle training improved inspiratory muscle strength, endurance time, 6 or 12 minute walk distance, and also reduced dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On the other hand, a systematic review indicates that expiratory muscle training will improve expiratory muscle forces, but not the six minute walk distance or dyspnea in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. More data are needed to clarify the possible role of expiratory muscle training on clinical outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Strength training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Training for strength is achieved by a high intensity, short duration stimulus, such as performance of inspiratory maneuvers against a closed glottis or shutter. An increase in maximal inspiratory pressures has been demonstrated when the respiratory muscles have been specifically trained for strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Respiratory muscle strength has also been shown to increase as a by-product of endurance training. It is therefore possible that some of the observed benefits reported after endurance training may be related to the associated increase in strength.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Endurance training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Training for endurance is achieved by low intensity, high repetition training. Three types of programs have been used: flow resistive loading; threshold loading; and voluntary isocapnic hyperpnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow resistive loading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from numerous studies indicate that ventilatory muscle training with flow resistive breathing results in improved ventilatory muscle strength and endurance, but has marginal effects on overall exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is not clear whether improved strength and endurance will result in decreased morbidity or mortality, or offers other clinical advantages.</p><p>In flow resistive load training, the load consists of using a device with an adjustable inspiratory breath hole size. The load will increase provided that frequency, tidal volume, and inspiratory time are held constant. Although most studies in patients with COPD have shown an improvement in the time that a given respiratory load can be maintained (ventilatory muscle endurance), the results have to be interpreted with caution, since endurance can be increased with changes in the pattern of breathing.</p><p>A number of controlled studies of resistive breathing have shown an increase in the endurance time that the ventilatory muscles could tolerate a known load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/13-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-21</a>]. Some have also shown a significant increase in strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/13-15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,17-20</a>] and exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and a decrease in dyspnea during inspiratory loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. The pressure required to achieve training must exceed 30 percent of maximal inspiratory pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. In the studies which evaluated systemic exercise performance, there was a minimal increase in walking distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/13,17,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17,19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Threshold loading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With threshold loading, the patient breathes through a device that requires the patient to generate a threshold or target level of work before inspiratory airflow can begin. The threshold pressure needed to initiate inspiratory flow is high enough to ensure training, independent of inspiratory flow rate. When threshold devices are used, the breathing pattern (inspiratory time and respiratory rate) is not as critically important because the pressure required to activate the threshold is independent of the flow.</p><p>The benefit of inspiratory threshold loading was demonstrated in a trial of 33 patients with severe COPD who were randomly assigned to receive high intensity training (highest tolerable inspiratory threshold load) or sham training (only 10 percent of the maximal inspiratory pressure) three times per week for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. High intensity training resulted in a greater increase of the maximum inspiratory pressure (18 versus 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), maximum threshold pressure (21 versus 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), and six-minute walking distance (27 versus 5 meters), as well as improved dyspnea and fatigue, compared to sham training.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 92 patients on mechanical ventilation were assigned to inspiratory muscle training (40 percent of maximal pressure 10 breaths twice a day, seven days a week) or usual care until extubation, tracheostomy, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Muscle training improved inspiratory muscle strength and tidal volume compared with usual care, but had no effect on weaning outcome. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a separate study, 29 patients with COPD who remained hypercapnic after successful weaning from mechanical ventilation to noninvasive ventilation were randomized to inspiratory muscle (IMT) or sham training for four weeks during a pulmonary rehabilitation program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients in the IMT group significantly improved their walking distance (3 to 186 m, p = 0.04 for between-group comparison) and their maximal inspiratory pressure (-6 to -33 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, p = 0.001) suggesting that IMT significantly enhances functional exercise capacity and increases respiratory muscle strength and power. However, no major changes were seen in arterial blood gases and no evidence was presented for effect on health status.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Voluntary isocapnic hyperpnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Voluntary isocapnic hyperpnea is a training method in which patients maintain high levels of ventilation over time (for 15 minutes, two or three times daily). Sufficient carbon dioxide is added to inspired gas to maintain a constant arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), which is measured indirectly by the end-tidal partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies evaluating the efficacy of respiratory muscle endurance training using voluntary isocapnic hyperpnea have had different results. Two controlled studies reported increases of maximal sustained ventilatory capacity (MSVC) in patients with COPD who were trained for six weeks, but the improvement in exercise endurance was no better than that observed in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In contrast, a more recent study demonstrated improvement of endurance exercise capacity, respiratory muscle endurance capacity, perception of dyspnea, and quality of life compared to control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In a variation of hyperpnea training, 313 patients who underwent open cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to daily home training with deep breathing exercises for two months or to usual care. No differences were observed in health status measured with the short form 36 questionnaire or in lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516278452\"><span class=\"h2\">Novel training methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of non-conventional methods of training to improve ventilator muscle synchronization and function has gained some attention. Amongst them, the implementation of Tai-Chi techniques for patients with COPD was the topic of a Cochrane Database Systematic review of 12 randomized trials with 984 patients, lasting from six weeks up to one year. In total, the review documented a small but significant improvement in the six-minute walk distance (mean difference [MD] 29.6 meters, 95% CI 10.5-48.8 meters) and in the FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.11 L, 95% CI 0.02-0.20 L). However, the effect on dyspnea and health status remained inconclusive. More studies are needed to establish the value of these training methods on health resource utilization and outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5625014\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential deleterious effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is also the potential for ventilatory muscle training to be deleterious. Breathing at a high proportion of the functional reserve or with a prolonged inspiratory time may induce muscle fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Both factors are an intrinsic part of training; it is therefore possible that a sufficiently intense training program may precipitate fatigue. This may explain why compliance with such training programs is low, with up to 50 percent of patients failing to complete the studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY MUSCLE RESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory muscles may fatigue when working against a sufficiently large load. This has been shown to occur experimentally in normal volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Clinically, respiratory muscle fatigue appears to play an important role in the acute respiratory failure of patients with COPD. In comparison, patients with chronic stable COPD are not suffering from chronic respiratory muscle fatigue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute on chronic respiratory failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with acute on chronic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD, the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which enables respiratory muscle unloading and resting, has been shown to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. The implementation of NIV for acute on chronic respiratory failure in COPD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients best suited for this method were those with elevated arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> who were able to cooperate with the care givers and had no other important co-morbid problems, such as sepsis or severe pneumonia. Because NIV is potentially dangerous, patients considered for this therapy should be closely monitored and treated by individuals familiar with this ventilatory technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The various trials evaluated different outcomes, including rate of intubation, length of stay in the intensive care unit or in the hospital, dyspnea, and mortality. Although not all studies found the same results in the most important outcomes (such as mortality), there was uniform agreement that respiratory muscle resting using NIV was effective in reversing acute respiratory failure. As an example, one study showed that patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure who were treated with NIV were more likely to improve without requiring intubation than those randomized to standard therapy (9 versus 67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic stable COPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility that the respiratory muscles of patients with severe COPD are functioning close to the threshold for fatigue has led numerous investigators to explore a potential role of resting the respiratory muscles with noninvasive negative or positive pressure ventilation. The data are conflicting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several older trials and a systematic review showed no benefit to positive or negative pressure ventilation for most of the outcomes studied, including rate of hospitalization, quality of life, and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/27,33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33-38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent trials have continued to offer contradictory results. One trial randomly assigned 201 patients with acute respiratory failure and prolonged hypercapnia (&gt;48 hours) to either NIV or usual care after resolution of the acute episode. Over the one year of the study, the arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) was lower in patients using NIV, but there were no differences in re-admissions, time to next event, mood state, activity levels, or dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another multicenter trial of patients with compensated hypercapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &ge;52 mmHg [&ge;7 kPa] and pH &gt;7.35) randomly assigned 102 patients to receive home NIV with a targeted reduction of PaCO<sub>2</sub> of at least 20 percent and 95 patients to receive usual care. The intent to treat analysis revealed a higher one year mortality (33 versus 12 percent, p=0.0004) in the control group compared with the NIV group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most important difference between this and other trials is the use of a higher ventilator pressure in this trial. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the controversial findings, the change in cardiac output after six weeks of high intensity NIV or lower intensity NIV has been assessed with echocardiography in 14 stable, severe COPD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-training-and-resting-in-copd/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Eleven patients were included in the analysis, which found that cardiac output and NTproBNP did not change, although individual effects were noticed, depending on the pressures applied <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the coexistence of heart failure. The authors concluded that the application of very high inspiratory pressures might reduce cardiac output in patients with pre-existing heart failure. More studies are needed to corroborate all of these findings, identify patients that are likely to benefit, and to clarify the optimal NIV settings.</p><p/><p>The use of nocturnal NIV in patients with severe COPD and hypercapnia is discussed separately.

While respiratory muscle training can decrease dyspnea, controversy remains as to whether training also improves exercise performance or performance of activities of daily living. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Strength and endurance training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It seems logical to predict that increases in strength and endurance would help respiratory muscle function.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Strength and endurance training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact criteria for patient selection remain unclear. Stable patients with dyspnea and respiratory muscle weakness are likely to benefit from respiratory muscle training; patients with acute decompensation are unlikely to benefit from such training. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Strength and endurance training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory muscle training can induce deleterious effects, such as an uncomfortable degree of fatigue, when breathing at a high proportion of the functional reserve or with a prolonged inspiratory time.
