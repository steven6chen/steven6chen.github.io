However, since diagnostic and treatment tools for TB in children have begun to improve significantly, TB in children has received increasing attention by researchers, clinicians, and policy makers.</p><p>Issues related to TB disease in children will be reviewed here.

In its 2017 report, the WHO estimates that, of the 10.4 million incident cases of TB in 2016, approximately 1 million occurred among children under age 15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of the 10.4 million incident cases of TB reported in 2016, 6.9 percent were in children with an equal number of males and females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2017, the WHO and colleagues estimated that there were 239,000 pediatric deaths due to TB (39,000 occurring in HIV-infected children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 80 percent of these deaths occurred in children under age five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Children under age five represent an important demographic group for understanding TB epidemiology, since TB frequently progresses rapidly from latent infection to disease, and severe disease manifestations, such as miliary TB and meningitis, are more common in this age group. Therefore, these children serve as sentinel cases, indicating recent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ongoing transmission in the community.</p><p>Most children are infected by household contacts with TB disease, particularly parents or other caretakers. Even in circumstances when adult index cases are sputum smear negative, transmission to children has been documented in 30 to 40 percent of households [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>It has been estimated that, of nearly one million children who developed tuberculosis disease in 2010, 32,000 had multidrug-resistant TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In the United States, TB among children is relatively rare. In 2013, there were 485 cases of TB in children and adolescents under 15 years of age reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); this number represented 5 percent of the total 9582 cases reported that year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. However, TB in children and adolescents is prone to both under- and over-reporting due to the difficulties related to diagnosis. Nonetheless, in the United States, TB in children and adolescents appears to be declining. Between 2008 and 2012, TB annual case notifications in those under age 15 years decreased from 786 (in 2008) to 486 cases (in 2012) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In 2012, most children and adolescents with TB in the United States were born in the United States (79 percent). In contrast, most adults with TB in the United States were born in endemic areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F111123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111123 \">table 1</a>). Nearly half of all patients under age 15 diagnosed with TB in 2012 (42 percent) were young children between the ages of 1 and 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In 2012, among 471 children and adolescents with TB in the United States, 40 percent were Hispanic, 27 percent were black, 22 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander, 8 percent were white, and 4 percent were American Indian or Native Alaskan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Between 1993 and 2011, HIV status was known for 24 percent of the pediatric patients reported (n = 19,354); of these, 3.7 percent were HIV infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Drug susceptibility testing data from 2011 reveal that the isolates from 17 percent of pediatric TB cases had detectable resistance to one or more drugs, and 3 percent were multidrug-resistant TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary disease and associated intrathoracic adenopathy are the most frequent presentations of tuberculosis (TB) in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Common symptoms of pulmonary TB in children include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic, unremitting cough that is not improving and has been present for more than three weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever of more than 38&deg;C for at least two weeks, other common causes having been excluded</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss or failure to thrive (based on child's growth chart)</p><p/><p>However, these symptoms are fairly nonspecific. In one study comparing symptoms of children with culture-proven TB with children with other lung diseases, there was no difference between the two groups with respect to weight loss, chronic cough, and duration of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The only factors differentiating the groups were history of contact with an infectious TB case and a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST). In a study of more than 1000 HIV-uninfected infants in South Africa, cough &gt;2 weeks' duration (present in 17 percent) was the only diagnostic symptom associated with severe pulmonary TB disease; this symptom was twice as common in severe TB compared with nonsevere TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Physical exam findings may suggest the presence of a lower respiratory infection, but there are no specific clinical signs or findings to confirm that pulmonary TB is the cause. Children ages 5 to 10 may present with clinically silent (but radiographically apparent) disease, particularly in the setting of contact investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, infants are more likely to present with signs and symptoms of lung disease. Common radiographic findings are discussed below.

The most common forms of extrapulmonary disease in children are TB of the superficial lymph nodes and of the central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Neonates have the highest risk of progression to TB disease with miliary and meningeal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Clinical evaluation of the infant in the setting of suspected congenital TB should include TST, HIV testing, chest radiograph, lumbar puncture, cultures (blood and respiratory specimens), and evaluation of the placenta with histologic examination (including acid-fast bacilli [AFB] staining culture). The TST in newborns is usually negative, but an interferon-gamma release assay test may be positive in some cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal TB develops following exposure of an infant to his or her mother's aerosolized respiratory secretions. This is more common than congenital TB, and diagnosis of neonatal TB can lead to identification of previously unrecognized diagnosis of TB in the mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>In the setting of congenital or neonatal TB, the mother should be evaluated as outlined in detail separately.

In one review including 145 cases of adolescent TB, the following features were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adolescents presented with clinical symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of extrathoracic TB were high, including six immunocompetent adolescents with TB meningitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases were AFB sputum smear negative.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only half of patients with intrathoracic TB had positive cultures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antituberculous medications were generally well tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis (TB) in children is often diagnosed clinically. Because pulmonary TB in children typically presents with paucibacillary, noncavitary pulmonary disease, bacteriologic confirmation is achievable in less than 50 percent of children and 75 percent of infants; in such cases, pulmonary TB is diagnosed by other clinical criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>It is suggested that mycobacterial culture of respiratory specimens be performed for children suspected of having pulmonary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, obtaining sputum samples from young children is challenging due to lack of sufficient tussive force to produce adequate sputum samples by expectoration alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For these reasons, gastric aspiration is the principal means of obtaining material for culture from young children; induced sputum may also be collected if feasible. In addition, most experts recommend that children &lt;12 months who are suspected of having pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB undergo lumbar puncture, regardless of whether neurological symptoms are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>For diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB, specimens for culture should be collected from any site where infection is suspected. Each specimen should be cultured regardless of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The most common extrapulmonary specimens include whole blood, bone marrow, tissue specimens (such as lymph node or bone), cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and pleural fluid. Diagnostic yield is variable. In pleural TB, adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels over 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> in the pleural fluid are observed in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pleural-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pleural effusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of TB (pulmonary or extrapulmonary) in a child is often based on the presence of the classic triad: (1) recent close contact with an infectious case, (2) a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), and (3) suggestive findings on chest radiograph or physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The approach outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for evaluation of a child suspected of having TB includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful history (including history of TB contact and symptoms consistent with TB)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical examination (including growth assessment)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TST <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IGRA (both tests, if available, to increase sensitivity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteriological confirmation whenever possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigations relevant for suspected pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV testing (eg, in high HIV-prevalence areas)</p><p/><p>All data, including thorough history, physical exam, and diagnostic testing, must be considered carefully. A history of recent close contact with an infectious (sputum smear positive) case of TB is a critical factor in making the diagnosis of TB in children, especially for those under the age of five years. However, the ill adult may have not yet been diagnosed, so asking about ill contacts and facilitating evaluation for ill adults can also expedite diagnosis for children.</p><p>In many cases of TB in children, laboratory confirmation is never established (particularly among children under five years of age). In such cases, a presumptive diagnosis may be made based on clinical and radiographic response to empiric treatment. Treatment is often guided by the culture and drug susceptibility results from the index case (eg, the adult TB contact). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculin skin test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive TST may be present in both contained latent TB infection (LTBI) and in active TB disease. Thus, although a positive TST may help support a diagnosis of active disease, this finding alone is not diagnostic of active disease; it must be considered together with other diagnostic criteria. The TST is helpful for diagnosis of TB in children only in circumstances when it is positive. Criteria for positive TST are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78596 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A positive TST may be falsely positive due to prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG), infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria, and improper administration or interpretation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58908 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>A negative TST does NOT rule out TB disease, since false-negative results can occur in a variety of circumstances (eg, incorrect administration or interpretation of the TST, age less than six months, immunosuppression by HIV, other disease or medication, certain viral illnesses or recent live-virus immunization, overwhelming TB infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26</a>].

Overall, up to 40 percent of immunocompetent children with culture-confirmed TB disease may have a negative TST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28</a>]. TST positivity rates vary by form of disease; in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, the TST is typically positive (90 and 80 percent, respectively), while in miliary TB and TB meningitis, the TST is usually positive in only 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Interferon-gamma release assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IGRAs are in vitro blood tests of cell-mediated immune response.

As with the TST, IGRAs cannot distinguish LTBI from active disease.

Test performance was unaffected by patient HIV status. Results for Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> were available within a median of one day (versus 12 days for culture). Detection of rifampin resistance was less promising: 1 of 3 rifampin-resistant isolates was not detected, and 4 of 74 rifampin-sensitive isolates had an &quot;indeterminate&quot; result.

Therefore, these children serve as sentinel cases, indicating recent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ongoing transmission in the community. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common symptoms of pulmonary TB in children include cough (chronic, without improvement for more than three weeks), fever (more than 38&ordm;C for more than two weeks), and weight loss or failure to thrive. Physical exam findings may suggest the presence of a lower respiratory infection, but there are no specific findings to confirm that pulmonary TB is the cause. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of extrapulmonary TB depends on the site of disease. The most common forms of extrapulmonary disease in children are TB of the superficial lymph nodes and of the central nervous system. Infants have the highest risk of progression to TB disease with dissemination (miliary TB) and meningeal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Extrapulmonary tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forms of perinatal TB include congenital and neonatal disease. Congenital TB is very rare and most often is associated with maternal tuberculous endometritis or miliary TB. Neonatal TB is more common and develops following exposure of an infant to his or her mother's aerosolized respiratory secretions. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TB in children is often diagnosed clinically; in many cases, laboratory confirmation is never established (particularly among children under five years of age). Diagnosis is often based on the presence of the classic triad: (1) recent close contact with an infectious case, (2) a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), and (3) suggestive findings on chest radiograph or physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, the TST or IGRA may be used as a tool for diagnosis of TB disease or latent TB infection (LTBI; although, in adults, the TST or IGRA may be used only for diagnosis of LTBI, not TB disease). The TST or IGRA is helpful for diagnosis of TB in children only in circumstances when it is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78596 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Tuberculin skin test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common chest radiograph finding in a child with TB disease is a primary complex, which consists of opacification with hilar or subcarinal lymphadenopathy, in the absence of notable parenchymal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric aspiration is the primary method of obtaining material for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture from young children, since these patients lack sufficient tussive force to produce adequate sputum samples by expectoration alone. Alternative approaches include sputum induction or expectoration (for older children). For diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB, specimens for culture should be collected from any site where infection is suspected. Diagnosis of TB should also prompt HIV testing. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pediatric treatment regimens for TB are outlined in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50271\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50271 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79897\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79897 \">table 5</a>). Because TB in young children can rapidly disseminate with serious sequelae, prompt initiation of therapy is critical.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Starke JR.
