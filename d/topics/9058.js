However, it was not until insulin became available for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in the early 1920s that clinical events similar to those arising from overtreatment with insulin were identified in nondiabetic persons. This observation led to the postulation of a new disease entity called hyperinsulinism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Support for the existence of hyperinsulinism was provided by finding a malignant pancreatic islet-cell tumor in a patient who had episodes of severe hypoglycemia in 1927 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Extracts of the tumor caused marked hypoglycemia in rabbits. The first cure of hyperinsulinism by removal of an insulinoma was reported in 1929 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of insulinomas will be reviewed here. The causes and evaluation of hypoglycemia, and the management of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors are discussed separately.

However, postprandial hypoglycemia may be a feature or even the sole manifestation of hypoglycemia in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The hypoglycemia in persons with insulinoma is primarily due to reduced hepatic glucose output rather than increased glucose utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The mechanism by which insulinomas maintain high levels of insulin secretion in the presence of hypoglycemia is unknown. However, one study reported that a variant of insulin mRNA with increased translation efficiency is present in high amounts in insulinomas when compared with normal islets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Virtually all insulinomas are islet-cell tumors; there is one report of an insulin-secreting small cell carcinoma of the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other tumors can produce hypoglycemia by different mechanisms, such as the production of insulin-like growth factor-2. The diagnostic approach is reviewed in detail separately.

Thus, staging and grading systems have been developed to better study and predict long-term outcomes. As an example, the World Health Organization estimates the malignant potential of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors using a classification scheme that is based upon stage-related (ie, tumor size &lt;2 versus &gt;2 cm, and the presence of metastases) and grade-related (mitotic rate, perineural and lymphovascular invasion, Ki-67 proliferative index) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

An unusual feature of this disorder is that hypoglycemia occurs postprandially, two to four hours after a meal. Fasting hypoglycemia, characteristic of insulinoma, is rare in this disorder.

Symptoms can occur postprandially, fasting, or in both states. In patients with insulin autoantibodies, it has been postulated that insulin secreted in response to a meal binds to the antibody and then disassociates in an unregulated fashion causing hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. In patients with antibodies to the insulin receptor, hypoglycemia occurs as a result of antibody activation of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The presence of insulin or insulin receptor antibodies can distinguish insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia from insulinoma. The antibodies do not have to be measured during an episode of hypoglycemia.

Accurate preoperative localization of an insulinoma is desirable because some tumors may not be palpable at the time of surgery, and patients can be advised of the type of surgery planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The noninvasive procedures available include spiral computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transabdominal ultrasonography, 111-In-pentetreotide imaging, and fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography (18F-DOPA PET) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The choice of procedure depends upon which tests are available and local radiologic skill. Transabdominal ultrasonography is our preferred initial test. In a series of 237 patients with insulinoma who were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic, the rate of detection by transabdominal ultrasound and triple-phase spiral CT of the pancreas was approximately 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Pentetreotide scintigraphy will miss up to 40 percent of insulinomas because these tumors do not express a sufficient number of subtype 2 somatostatin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>].

This test is based upon the observation that calcium stimulates the release of insulin from hyperfunctional beta cells (insulinomas or nesidioblastosis) but not normal beta cells. Calcium stimulates insulin release in the same arterial territory as the abnormal beta cells, which facilitates operative localization.</p><p>In the Mayo Clinic series of 237 patients with insulinoma, the sensitivity of SACST for localization of insulinoma was 93 percent for those patients selected to undergo this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When invasive testing (endoscopic ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SACST) was performed in patients with negative noninvasive (ultrasound, CT abdomen) testing, tumor localization was achieved in all cases from 1998 onward.

In a retrospective review of 116 cases of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and negative or inconclusive noninvasive imaging from the Mayo Clinic (1996 to 2014), 42 patients were subsequently shown at surgery to have insulinoma and 74 nesidioblastosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
