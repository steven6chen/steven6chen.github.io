Of the first 149 episodes, 40 were considered proven (defined as two positive cultures and more than one sign of clinical sepsis [temperature instability, cardiorespiratory or gastrointestinal disturbances, lethargy or irritability]), 55 were considered probable (defined as isolation of CoNS from one positive culture that was deemed a probable pathogen after review of clinical data and laboratory data by two pediatric infectious disease specialists), and 54 were considered due to contamination.

(See <a href=\"#H176897900\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal sepsis is typically classified by the infant's age into early-onset sepsis (EOS, &le;3 days of life) due to maternal vertical transmitted bacteria, and late-onset sepsis (LOS, &gt;3 days of life) due to bacteria acquired at birth or from environmental horizontal transmission. EOS occurs in approximately 2 percent and LOS in approximately 10 to 40 percent of VLBW infants, depending upon birth weight and gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H176896156\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H176897900\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In preterm infants, group B <em>Streptococcus</em> (GBS) and gram-negative infections (typically <em>Escherichia coli</em>) are the most common bacteria causing EOS, and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) is the most common bacteria causing LOS. (See <a href=\"#H462631954\" class=\"local\">'Etiologic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors that increase the likelihood of sepsis in preterm infants compared with term infants include their decreased immunocompetence, poorer epithelial mucosal barrier, and increased prevalence of invasive procedures and interventions associated with infection (eg, central venous lines, and umbilical arterial and venous catheterization). (See <a href=\"#H176900371\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors associated with prematurity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In preterm infants, the spectrum of symptoms of neonatal sepsis ranges from nonspecific subtle findings (eg, mild increase in apnea) to fulminant septic shock. Because the signs and symptoms of sepsis can be subtle and nonspecific, any deviation from an infant's usual pattern of activity or feeding should be regarded as a possible indication of systemic bacterial infection. (See <a href=\"#H462631989\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isolation of a pathogen from a blood culture is the only method to confirm the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H176899191\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of neonates with suspected sepsis should include review of risk factors and clinical findings, and a laboratory evaluation that minimally includes a blood culture. Other laboratory tests include a complete blood count with a differential, lumbar puncture prior to antibiotic therapy to determine whether meningitis is present, urine culture for infants &gt;6 days of age, and culture of any other potential foci of infection (eg, pustule). Empiric antibiotic therapy is generally initiated while awaiting culture results. (See <a href=\"#H462631996\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of neonatal sepsis includes other systemic infections, in-born errors of metabolism, critical congenital heart disease, and neonatal respiratory distress. These conditions are differentiated from sepsis by the clinical history and laboratory evaluation, including culture.
