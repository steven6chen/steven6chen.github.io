Myomectomy is removal of the myomas, while leaving the uterus in place.</p><p>Myomatous uteri have an increased number of arterioles and venules and myomectomy may involve significant blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, studies show that the blood loss is no greater than for hysterectomy, when controlled for uterine size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The average volume of blood loss during abdominal myomectomy (performed via laparotomy, also referred to as open myomectomy) is 200 to 800 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and for laparoscopic myomectomy is 80 to 250 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Surgical hemorrhage may result in anemia, hypovolemia, and coagulation abnormalities. </p><p>Bleeding can be prevented or decreased with mechanical or pharmacologic methods. Allogeneic blood transfusion can be avoided by using methods of autologous blood transfusion (autologous blood donation, intraoperative and postoperative blood salvage, or acute normovolemic [isovolemic] hemodilution). </p><p>Techniques to reduce blood loss during abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy are reviewed here. Preoperative and postoperative care and surgical technique for abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-myomectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal myomectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic myomectomy and other laparoscopic treatments for uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3731788\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ANATOMY OF THE UTERUS AND LEIOMYOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ascending blood supply of the uterus is from the uterine arteries, which pass through the cardinal ligament at level of the cervicouterine junction. The descending blood supply is from the ovarian arteries, which pass through the infundibulopelvic ligaments (suspensory ligaments of the ovary) and perfuse the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterine cornua (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54737 \">figure 1</a>). The uterine and ovarian vessels anastomose to perfuse the uterus. Arcuate arteries run transversely within the uterine wall and radial arteries penetrate deeply into the myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The presence of leiomyomas in the uterus distorts normal vascular architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, the arcuate arteries may run in any axis, rather than transversely. Thus, either vertical or transverse incisions during myomectomy may transect these vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-myomectomy#H1522049\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal myomectomy&quot;, section on 'Uterine incision'</a>.)</p><p>It has been the common teaching that there is a vascular pedicle at the base of each myoma, and that ligation of this pedicle will achieve hemostasis during myomectomy. However, a study using vascular corrosion casting and electron microscopy revealed that myomas are surrounded completely by a dense vascular layer supplying the myoma, which is separated from the myometrium by a narrow avascular cleft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389273\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several preoperative measures can be taken to reduce the likelihood of postoperative anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389432\"><span class=\"h2\">Correction of anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency anemia associated with menorrhagia or dietary deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in the gynecologic patient population. In women with abnormal uterine bleeding, a common symptom of uterine leiomyomas, laboratory testing for anemia should be part of the diagnostic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preoperative anemia increases likelihood of blood transfusion and also increases the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. A systematic review of 20 observational studies confirmed the association between preoperative anemia and blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No meta-analysis was performed to quantify the magnitude of this effect, but in one representative study of 212 patients who underwent colorectal surgery, the rate of transfusion was significantly higher in those with a hemoglobin &le;12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> compared with &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (49 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The effect of preoperative anemia on perioperative morbidity was illustrated in a retrospective study of 1958 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery and declined blood transfusion for religious reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A preoperative hemoglobin of &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> was associated with a three-fold or higher increase in serious perioperative morbidity (cardiac events, respiratory failure, or serious bacterial infection) or mortality. </p><p>Preoperative anemia may be treated with iron supplementation. Strategies to correct anemia preoperatively are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Correction of anemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389439\"><span class=\"h2\">GnRH agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative use of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists provides some short-term benefits for women undergoing myomectomy regarding blood loss and uterine size, but may increase the difficulty of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the long-term, their use appears to increase the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/recurrent</span> myomas. </p><p>Preoperatively, GnRH agonists can help correct anemia by temporarily inducing amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, the clinical impact of these agents is controversial. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials compared women planning abdominal myomectomy who were treated with a GnRH agonist for three to four months with those receiving either placebo or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Preoperative GnRH agonist therapy resulted in a small, but statistically significant, increase in preoperative hemoglobin (1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> higher). A further benefit of treatment with these agents was a reduction in intraoperative blood loss (68 mL less). Ultimately, however, there was no significant decrease in the risk of blood transfusion in women treated with GnRH (14 percent for both treatment groups; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.26-2.85). This analysis was limited by insufficient statistical power to detect this difference. </p><p>Another potential benefit of GnRH agonists is reduction in uterine size. This may permit the use of a transverse rather than vertical laparotomy incision or may make a laparoscopic approach possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-myomectomy#H623653\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal myomectomy&quot;, section on 'Reducing uterine size with GnRH agonists'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H26569841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic myomectomy and other laparoscopic treatments for uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'GnRH agonists'</a>.)</p><p>There are several important disadvantages of preoperative use of GnRH agonists. These agents make enucleation of fibroids more difficult by obscuring the tissue plane between the myoma and the myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Operative difficulty associated with GnRH agonist pretreatment has been measured in only one randomized trial, which found no difference in difficulty between pretreatment with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> compared with immediate surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In our experience, however, operative difficulty <strong>is</strong> noticeably increased after pretreatment with these medications. </p><p>There is concern that pretreatment with GnRH agonists may increase the risk of persistent myomas, because small myomas would shrink in size and would not be palpable during myomectomy. The meta-analysis described above reported a significantly higher rate of post-myomectomy myomas in women treated with GnRH agonists compared with placebo or no treatment (11 of 17 [65 percent] versus 7 of 25 [28 percent]; OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.1-14.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The sample sizes and number of events in this analysis were small and the follow-up period ranged widely from 6 to 38 months. A subsequent randomized trial (n = 108) that compared eight weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> therapy with no treatment had a similar finding (proportion of women with myomas at six-month follow-up: 8 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Most of the data regarding GnRH agonists and myomectomy are for open procedures. The only randomized trial to address this issue in women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy found that GnRH agonist treatment compared with no treatment resulted in a significant increase in operative duration (45 minutes longer) and no decrease in blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H1880877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic myomectomy and other laparoscopic treatments for uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Conversion to laparotomy'</a>.) </p><p>GnRH antagonists are another type of agent that suppresses endogenous GnRH. Their effects are similar to those of GnRH agonists, with the exception that results would be seen sooner, since GnRH is immediately suppressed. However, these agents are not widely used for a preoperative indication, since they are more expensive than GnRH agonists and require a daily injection. There are no high quality data regarding use of GnRH antagonists prior to myomectomy. </p><p>Treatment with either GnRH agonists or antagonists is accompanied by menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flashes, mood disturbance) that many women find difficult to tolerate. </p><p>In summary, there is no evidence that use of GnRH agonists prior to myomectomy reduces the risk of blood transfusion and such use may increase operative difficulty and the risk of myoma <span class=\"nowrap\">persistence/recurrence</span>. The primary advantage of use of these agents is the ability to use a more favorable laparotomy incision or, potentially, to use a laparoscopic approach. We suggest <strong>not</strong> using GnRH agonist pretreatment for women undergoing open or laparoscopic myomectomy. Use of these agents is a reasonable option in women for whom treatment would allow a transverse rather than a vertical incision or a laparoscopic rather than open myomectomy and who place a high priority on type of surgical incision <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duration of recovery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1390136\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous blood donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient who is scheduled for surgery and is not anemic may bank one or more units of her own blood.

No studies have compared directly between these medications. Surgeons should use the agent with which they are most experienced, barring any individual patient contraindications. The most commonly used agent is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4413358\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasopressin and other vasoconstrictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intramyometrial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> injected into the planned uterine incision site for each fibroid reduces blood loss. Vasopressin acts by constricting the smooth muscle in the walls of capillaries, small arterioles, and venules. Randomized trial data show that blood loss during myomectomy with vasopressin is significantly less than with placebo (299 mL less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]) and less than or comparable to use of a uterine artery tourniquet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Safe use of </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> - Vasopressin use during myomectomy has been associated with rare cases of bradycardia, cardiovascular collapse, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Vasopressin use may be contraindicated in women with medical comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular, vascular, or renal disease). The use of vasopressin to decrease blood loss during myomectomy has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. <br/><br/>Safe use of vasopressin depends upon the surgeon&rsquo;s knowledge of its pharmacodynamics and use of safe practices. Care should be taken to avoid intravascular injection; before injecting, the surgeon should pull back on the plunger of the syringe to check for blood. However, complications may result even if intravascular injection does not occur. The maximal safe dose of vasopressin is not well established. Cardiovascular complications following intramyometrial injection have been reported in isolated cases with total vasopressin doses ranging from 5 to 11 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/23-25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25,27,28</a>]. A classic prospective cohort study found no cardiovascular complication in 13 women undergoing myomectomy who received a maximum of 4 units of intramyometrial vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. An upper limit of a cumulative total vasopressin dose per procedure of 4 to 6 units has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Use of a dilute solution helps to limit the total dose. In our practice, we dilute 20 units of vasopressin in 100 ml of saline; 4 to 6 units of vasopressin equals 20 to 30 mL of this solution. The half-life of intramuscular vasopressin is 10 to 20 minutes and the duration of action is two to eight hours.</p><p/><p>There are few data about combining use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> with other measures. The only randomized trial to address this issue included 105 women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy and were assigned to one of three groups: vasopressin combined with ligation of the myoma pedicle with a loop of suture, vasopressin alone, or no vasopressin or loop ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Blood loss was significantly lower with combined use of <span class=\"nowrap\">vasopressin/loop</span> ligation compared with vasopressin alone (59 versus 224 mL); both treatment groups had a significantly lower blood loss than the group that was not treated with either vasopressin or loop ligation (no treatment group: 364 mL). Ligation of the myoma pedicle merits further study. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> is another vasoconstrictor that is effective in reducing blood loss during myomectomy. One randomized trial found that intramyometrial injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> with epinephrine (50 mL bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.25 percent and 0.5 mL of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/ml</span> epinephrine) reduced blood loss compared with saline (69 mL less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There were no differences in blood pressure or heart rate between groups. Intravascular injection of epinephrine may cause acute cardiovascular adverse events, similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>. A disadvantage of epinephrine is that clinical experience during myomectomy is limited, since most gynecologic surgeons use vasopressin in this setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4413531\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterotonics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterotonics have been used during myomectomy.

Transfusion of banked autologous blood avoids some, but not all, of the risks that are associated with allogeneic blood transfusion. Transfusion of autologous blood should be restricted to the same indications as for allogeneic blood.

The uterine vessels will recannulate, so future fertility should theoretically be preserved. However, the impact on fertility and obstetric outcomes following uterine artery embolization as a primary procedure is not well established. For this reason, we reserve these techniques for situations in which other measures have failed and additional hemostasis is needed to avoid hysterectomy.

Blood loss during myomectomy is correlated with the size and number of myomas, and also with operative duration, (which depends in large part upon the first two factors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. During the preoperative evaluation of each patient, we assess the characteristics of the myomas and make our best clinical estimate of the risk of excessive blood loss. </p><p>In our practice, for all women undergoing myomectomy, we do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correct preoperative anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> before each uterine incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many surgeons apply a uterine artery tourniquet (for open myomectomy only) and ovarian artery clamps in all patients.

The average volume of blood loss during abdominal myomectomy is 200 to 800 mL and for laparoscopic myomectomy is 80 to 250 ml. (See <a href=\"#H1389281\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> using GnRH agonist pretreatment for women undergoing abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Use of these agents is a reasonable option in women for whom treatment would allow a transverse rather than a vertical laparotomy or a laparoscopic rather than abdominal myomectomy and who place a high priority on type of surgical incision <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duration of recovery. (See <a href=\"#H1389439\" class=\"local\">'GnRH agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce intraoperative blood loss for women undergoing laparoscopic or abdominal myomectomy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend intramyometrial injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> before each uterine incision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H505640517\" class=\"local\">'Tranexamic acid'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The above measures may be used in combination, although it is uncertain whether combined use further decreases blood loss. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other agents that appear to reduce blood loss include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, but further study of these agents is needed.
