It belongs to the axial group of the spondyloarthritis (SpA) family. The two major members of this group are AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA). The two differ in that significant plain radiographic changes affecting the sacroiliac joints are observed in patients with AS but not in those with nr-axSpA. AS characteristically affects young adults with a peak age of onset between 20 and 30 years. Although classically thought of as a spinal disease, transient acute arthritis of peripheral joints occurs in up to 50 percent of patients. In addition, other organs such as the eyes, lungs, heart, and kidneys can be affected.</p><p>The assessment, monitoring, prognosis, and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in adults are presented here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis in adults, and a detailed discussion of the clinical manifestations, approach to diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of SpA in children, are presented separately.

Our recommendations are generally consistent with 2010 update of guidelines jointly developed by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), 2014 guidelines proposed by an international task force, and the 2015 recommendations from the American College of Rheumatology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACR)/Spondylitis</span> Association of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(SAA)/Spondyloarthritis</span> Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) collaboration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The international task force advocates a &ldquo;treat to target&rdquo; approach to spondyloarthritis management, with an ideal goal of disease remission, and an alternative goal, appropriate particularly for some patients with more longstanding disease, of minimal disease activity (see <a href=\"#H24895270\" class=\"local\">'Acute phase reactants'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Management of AS is lifelong for each patient, and shared decision-making by patients and their clinicians is important in management.</p><p>The symptoms of AS and the rate of progression fluctuate with time and can vary substantially between patients. Functional limitations can result directly from disease activity but also indirectly from the feelings of helplessness and depression, which may be associated with disease activity and which also require recognition and appropriate treatment intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Unlike the BASDAI, the ASDAS also incorporates information from the level of acute phase reactants, in addition to clinical parameters (a patient global score and several questions also used for the BASDAI) (see <a href=\"#H32471209\" class=\"local\">'BASDAI'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The ASDAS has the advantage of categorizing the disease activity as inactive, moderate, high, or very high. It also defines the degree of change in the score that would classify the response to treatment as a clinically important improvement or major improvement<em>.</em></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24895116\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the general physical examination, the physical examination in AS focuses on three areas: axial joints, including the hips; peripheral joints; and entheses. Details of the assessment used in research are available (<a href=\"http://www.asas-group.org/clinical-instruments.php?id=02&amp;token=uGGGJzyXPE4G4L0UBsgY9jQfrzETcQX+9LOo36Z81aDjAr938865PleMcUD//CQaZ9a7F37TdFwtB6ATKGz2B68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7790\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.asas-group.org/clinical-instruments.php?id=02</a> and [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]). The parameters below are those used in clinical practice. There is considerable variation among healthy individuals in the ranges of motion of the cervical, thoracic and lower spine, which are influenced by the population studied, body habitus, age, and gender. Thus, the threshold values given should be considered as estimates, rather than precise cut-off points between normal and abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical spine &ndash; AS may cause forward stooping of the thoracic and cervical spine. The degree of flexion deformity is measured by asking the patient to stand erect with heels and buttocks against a wall and to extend his or her neck, while keeping the chin (mandible) horizontal in an attempt to touch the wall. Almost all normal individuals can touch the wall with the occiput. The distance between the occiput and the wall in a patient with AS reflects the degree of cervical deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62964 \">figure 1</a>). In addition, the range of flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation are also recorded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic spine &ndash; The range of motion of the costovertebral joints is measured by the degree of chest expansion. Chest expansion is measured at the level of the xiphoid. The patients are instructed to raise their arms above their heads and to exert a maximal forced expiration followed by a maximal inspiration. Normal expansion is usually &gt;2 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower spine &ndash; Range of motion of the lower spine is tested in the sagittal plane by the Schober test, and in the coronal plane by the extent of lateral spinal flexion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Schober test &ndash; The Schober test measures the forward flexion of the lumbar spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58884 \">figure 2</a>). The patient stands erect; a mark is placed at the midpoint of a line joining the posterior superior iliac spines (dimples of Venus); another mark is made 10 cm above it in the midline. The patient then bends forward maximally without bending the knees and the distance is measured again. In normal individuals, the difference between the two measurements should exceed 2 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lateral spinal flexion &ndash; With the patient standing erect with heel and back against a wall and knees and hands extended, the distance between the tip of the middle finger and the floor is measured. The patient is then instructed to bend sideways without bending the knees or lifting the heels. A second measurement is made and the difference between the two is recorded. The final result is the averaged measurements of right and left flexion. Normal is greater than 10 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sacroiliac joint tenderness &ndash; Patients who have pain in the region of the sacroiliac joints or the buttock may have tenderness elicited by direct pressure over the sacroiliac joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69832 \">figure 3</a>). In addition, three physical maneuvers can be used to exert stress on the sacroiliac joint and to bring out sacroiliac pain. However, none of these physical examinations for sacroiliac involvement have been demonstrated to be specific for sacroiliitis. These include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the patient lying supine, direct pressure is exerted by the examiner on the anterior superior iliac spine and, at the same time, the iliac spine is forced laterally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the patient lying on the side, pressure is exerted by the examiner to compress the pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80283\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80283 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the patient lying supine, he or she is instructed to flex one of the knees and then to abduct as well as externally rotate the corresponding hip. Pressure on the flexed knee causes pain at the corresponding sacroiliac joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60605 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip joint &ndash; Hip involvement should be suspected when a patient shows an abnormal gait. It is verified by testing whether there is limitation of flexion, internal and external rotation, or pain at the extremes of these joint motions. Destructive disease at the hip joints in AS can lead to flexion deformities. However, a unilateral flexion deformity is frequently masked by compensatory motion in the spine. To eliminate this problem during physical examination, the patient is asked to lie supine and maximally flex one hip. If there is a flexion deformity of the contralateral hip, the knee of the contralateral limb will be raised and the degree of flexion deformity can be measured by the angle of the contralateral thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64736%7ERHEUM%2F77527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64736 graphicRef77527 \">figure 6A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral joint count &ndash; This involves a 44-joint count of the number of tender <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swollen joints, including those of the ankles, feet and the sternoclavicular joints (page II40 in handbook in <a href=\"http://www.asas-group.org/&amp;token=uGGGJzyXPE4G4L0UBsgY9hJsTuEpFq5szW/6mO7VTEDruO3O9YjlfGZzZNUtn7wd&amp;TOPIC_ID=7790\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.asas-group.org/</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sausage digit (dactylitis) &ndash; The number of digits that have sausage appearance should be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis count &ndash; At least 18 entheseal sites are assessed during clinical trials (<a href=\"http://www.asas-group.org/&amp;token=uGGGJzyXPE4G4L0UBsgY9hJsTuEpFq5szW/6mO7VTEDruO3O9YjlfGZzZNUtn7wd&amp;TOPIC_ID=7790\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.asas-group.org/</a>). In practice, the minimum should be at the heel, at the sites where the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia are each attached to the calcaneus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By convention, all patients with AS show significant changes in the plain radiographs of the sacroiliac joints in the form of erosions or fusion. In research, radiographic damage of the spine is assessed using lateral views of the cervical and lumbar spine, graded vertebra by vertebra, and scored, for example, using the Modified Stokes Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In clinical practice, it is useful to examine the anterosuperior and anteroinferior margins of the lumbar vertebrae on a lateral spine radiograph, and to record those with syndesmophytes. In advanced disease, plain radiographs of the spine will reveal &quot;bamboo spine&quot; with virtually complete fusion of the vertebral column. At that stage there is usually fusion of the sacroiliac joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75935%7ERHEUM%2F50665\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75935 graphicRef50665 \">image 1A-B</a>).

Optimally, an initial evaluation and training by a physical therapist should be part of the therapeutic regimen.

The major causes of death in patients with AS were infections, cancer, and diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>].</p><p>In contrast to some other chronic rheumatic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome) the risk of developing lymphoma does not appear to be significantly increased in patients with AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The level of disease activity, presence of poor prognostic factors or concomitant illnesses, degree of functional impairment, patient's tolerance of the risk of adverse effects, expectations of treatment, and other psychosocial factors must be considered. The level of disease activity and the extent of improvement can be scored by using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) questionnaire <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend use of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Any NSAID may be effective. Regular use for a period of four weeks allows the maximal effect of a given NSAID to be assessed. If some but not satisfactory improvement is noted, the NSAID may be continued indefinitely while other interventions are initiated. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The NSAID can be supplemented by use of an analgesic; occasionally, low-potency opioids may be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend an exercise program for all patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Individual physical therapy may be needed by some. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacological treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest NOT using systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest intraarticular glucocorticoids for persistent peripheral joint involvement, enthesitis at sites other than the Achilles tendon, and for pain of sacroiliitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> [SSZ], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [MTX], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>) are ineffective for those with axial disease. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with axial disease who do not respond to NSAIDs we recommend an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). If there is failure to one anti-TNF agent, it is possible that an alternate anti-TNF agent can be effective. Prior to initiating anti-TNF therapy, active infection and latent tuberculosis should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in HIV-uninfected adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with predominantly peripheral arthritis who do not respond adequately to NSAIDs and for whom a TNF inhibitor is unavailable or is contraindicated, we recommend SSZ, unless there are contraindications (eg, allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics) to this drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Sulfasalazine'</a> above.) MTX is being used by some clinicians as an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H6377225\" class=\"local\">'Other DMARDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Secukinumab</a> (150 mg administered subcutaneously weekly for four weeks, then every four weeks thereafter) is an alternative biologic agent that may be used in patients with active AS. There is a paucity of data to guide therapy if the treatments recommended above as well as secukinumab are ineffective or contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H74097565\" class=\"local\">'Secukinumab'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9302526\" class=\"local\">'Possibly beneficial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical interventions are used selectively. Total joint replacement may be necessary for those whose joints are already destroyed. Wedge osteotomy of the spine is reserved for those patients with severe spinal deformities, as in patients with neck flexion so pronounced that useful forward vision is difficult or impossible. Fusion of the atlantoaxial joint of the cervical spine is needed if there is significant neck or occipital pain or evidence of neurologic dysfunction due to C1-C2 (atlantoaxial) subluxation, as occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-subluxation-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical subluxation in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Braun J, van den Berg R, Baraliakos X, et al. 2010 update of the ASAS/EULAR recommendations for the management of ankylosing spondylitis.
