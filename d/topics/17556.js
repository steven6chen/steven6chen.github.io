PHHI is a genetic disorder with familial and sporadic forms, both of which are characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion. Early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment are necessary to prevent or minimize neurologic damage from recurrent or prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia.</p><p>PHHI is a clinically heterogeneous disorder that depends in part on the genetic defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107384 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The clinical manifestations range from life-threatening hypoglycemia presenting on the first day of life to only mildly symptomatic hypoglycemia in a child or adolescent that may be difficult to identify. The response to medical and surgical therapy also varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The treatment and complications of PHHI will be presented here. The pathology, genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of PHHI and a review on islet cell tumors (insulinomas), which have similar clinical and biochemical features to PHHI, are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of therapy in persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is the prevention of acute neurologic symptoms (eg, seizure, lethargy, coma) and long-term sequelae (eg, epilepsy, cognitive deficits, microcephaly) of prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immediate goal is to increase and maintain the blood glucose concentration in a safe range (above 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> via intravenous administration of glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enteral feeding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term therapeutic approaches are directed toward decreasing insulin secretion pharmacologically or surgically and maintaining euglycemia to protect neurologic function. </p><p/><p>Therapy in infants and children with PHHI always should be directed by, or in conjunction with, a pediatric endocrinologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts must be made to maintain plasma glucose within the normal range during the diagnostic process (except during the controlled diagnostic &quot;fast&quot;). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31924479\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral glucose usually is required to maintain the plasma glucose concentrations in a normal range (80 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> or 4.4 to 7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mMol/L)</span>. In addition, placement of a central line should be considered early in the diagnostic and stabilization phase of management, because high rates of glucose infusion (10 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min) and high glucose concentrations in the infusate (&gt;10 percent) may be required to maintain euglycemia. Requirement for a glucose infusion rate &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute strongly supports the diagnosis of PHHI. We recommend measuring the blood glucose concentration at 30- to 60-minute intervals until a stable blood glucose concentration is established within the normal range. Once euglycemia is established, monitoring frequency should be decreased to an appropriate interval to assure maintenance of a normal plasma glucose concentration. </p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> (1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per hour, as a continuous infusion) may be helpful during the initial stabilization period and before surgery. However, this treatment may not be of long-term benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary therapy consisting of frequent and consistent feedings in infants may be helpful to reduce the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes and reduce the need for intravenous glucose. In some older infants and children with mild disease, frequent high-carbohydrate meals and the ingestion of uncooked cornstarch at night may be sufficient to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations without intravenous administration of glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, this technique may not be effective in young infants who may be relatively deficient in amylase. Some clinicians will supply continuous carbohydrate infusions via gastrostomy during the night or other times the child is not eating, to avoid hypoglycemia. When considering this approach, the clinician should carefully evaluate its medical necessity and the family's ability to manage the gastrostomy feeds at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERINSULINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term therapeutic approaches for persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) are directed toward decreasing insulin secretion. This may be accomplished pharmacologically or surgically. Pharmacologic interventions, although frequently unsuccessful, always should be tried before surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy for hyperinsulinism may involve treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> (a specific ATP-dependent potassium [K<sub>ATP</sub>] channel agonist in normal beta cells) or somatostatin analogues (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31077305\"><span class=\"h3\">Diazoxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Diazoxide</a> is the first-line therapy. It works by blocking the sulfonylurea receptors on the beta cells, resulting in opening of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and decreasing insulin release. Diazoxide is administered in doses of 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into three doses. The initial dose varies depending upon the preference of the treating provider. Some start with 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and increase the dose as necessary; others start with 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and decrease the dose as tolerated. The likelihood of response to diazoxide depends on the molecular defect, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107384 \">table 1</a>). Infants with certain types of ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations, or mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) or monocarboxylic acid transporter genes (<em>MCT1</em>, also known as <em>SLC16A1</em>) are unlikely to respond to diazoxide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of approach, it has been our experience that if a child does not respond at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, he or she will not respond at &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, and increasing the dose only increases the risks of medication-related complications. Defining a clear clinical response in this situation frequently is difficult. If no clear response is observed within 48 hours of the initiation of a dose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> will probably not be effective, and other alternatives should be considered. The authors define treatment success as maintenance of euglycemia after an overnight fast of 14 to 16 hours.</p><p>The most common side effects include hypertrichosis, which may be severe, and sodium and water retention. Other side effects include advanced bone age, mild hyperuricemia, decreased immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, decreased neutrophil counts, and thrombocytopenia. Water retention can be reduced by a thiazide diuretic, which may further reduce insulin secretion (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorothiazide</a> 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into two doses). Life-threatening complications such as ketoacidosis, heart failure, and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma are rare and can be avoided by daily monitoring of plasma glucose, urinary ketones, and fluid balance. Case reports suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> treatment of infants may be associated with pulmonary hypertension that resolves when diazoxide is discontinued, as described in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug safety communication in July 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31077312\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatostatin analogues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatostatin analogues (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a>) can be tried as a second-line therapy to reduce insulin secretion if treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> is unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Octreotide is frequently started together with diazoxide in an attempt to obtain control of the plasma glucose concentration. Case reports suggest that octreotide is associated with a modestly increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> is 5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day divided into three doses, but even higher doses have been used. The authors initiate therapy at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per injection, giving one to two injections per day, and double the dose if the patient remains hypoglycemic. No clear maximum dose has been established for these children. In some instances, 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span> has been used for short periods of time to determine the potential for therapeutic efficacy. The anticipated response under these circumstances is an acute rise in the plasma glucose concentration. Long-term follow-up studies have not been carried out to assess the potential side effects of prolonged therapy with octreotide for hyperinsulinism. Linear growth should be observed closely, as octreotide suppresses growth hormone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Two studies report the use of two different long-acting somatostatin analogues in children with PHHI with a variety of genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In both reports it had been established that these children were responsive to short-acting somatostatin. After switching to long-acting release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> (Sandostatin LP, Novartis) delivered IM monthly, glycemic control was slightly worse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The treatment seemed to be well tolerated despite requiring local anesthesia and sedation for each injection. Reported quality of life was unchanged for the children, but the parents' reports of general satisfaction were improved because of fewer injections and less concern about missed or delayed injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, these long-acting compounds may be useful in children who can be managed on a somatostatin analog, but should probably not be used as the first line medication until more thorough studies have been conducted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399924341\"><span class=\"h3\">Sirolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence that mutations that cause PHHI by interfering with K<sub>ATP</sub> channel function also lead to constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway (mammalian target of rapamycin complex), which may promote beta cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This provides a mechanistic basis for treatment of PHHI with the mTOR inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sirolimus</a> (previously known as rapamycin). In a small case series, sirolimus was used to treat four infants with PHHI that was unresponsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Three of the four infants had missense mutations in ABCC8, and the fourth had no identifiable mutations in ABCC8, KCNJ11, or HNF4A. All four patients had a clear glycemic response to sirolimus and no longer required intravenous infusions of dextrose and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a>; three were successfully weaned from octreotide. Subsequent reports with very small numbers of patients recommend caution in the use of sirolimus in these children, suggesting limited utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], development of diabetes in a patient at risk for diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the potential long-term side effects of mTOR inhibition in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Further studies and experience with sirolimus or related compounds is needed. Until the relative risks and benefits of sirolimus are better established, its use should be restricted to centers with extensive experience in treating these infants. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H364260165\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nifedipine</a>) have been used in the past, but we believe that they have little therapeutic value and would not recommend their use. In observational studies, nifedipine appeared to be successful in controlling insulin secretion or reducing the doses of other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>], but other case series suggest no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and this or other calcium-channel blocking agents for PHHI has not been evaluated in controlled trials. In the absence of such a trial, and because calcium-channel blocking agents have been used in conjunction with other medications and feeding strategies, their therapeutic efficacy, if any, remains to be determined. Long-term follow-up studies have not been carried out to assess the potential side effects of prolonged therapy with calcium-channel blockers for hyperinsulinism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31077326\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, PHHI is a heterogeneous disorder, with heterogeneous response to therapy even among patients with identical genetic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is reported that pharmacologic therapy is most useful in patients with autosomal dominant PHHI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some infants with the autosomal recessive form of PHHI respond to pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but most do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Pharmacologic and dietary therapy are more often successful in patients who present in infancy or childhood rather than as neonates (69 percent versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Infants and children with PHHI who are successfully treated pharmacologically should monitor blood glucose at home, particularly during intercurrent illnesses and fasts longer than 14 to 16 hours. Because there are case reports of spontaneous regression of PHHI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], patients should be reevaluated after four to six years of treatment to determine whether there is a need for continued treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with paternal uniparental disomy for ABCC8 or KCJN11 usually have a focal form of PHHI that is amenable to surgery. Surgical exploration is warranted in children older than several weeks of age in whom hyperinsulinism is proven and pharmacologic therapy fails to control hypoglycemia. However, caution should be used when considering an aggressive surgical approach within days of diagnosis. In some children, it is nearly impossible to maintain the plasma glucose concentration within a safe range regardless of medical management (medication and oral and intravenous glucose), and surgical management must be considered. On the other hand early surgical intervention may not be appropriate for other infants, such as infants exposed to perinatal stress (eg, birth asphyxia, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maternal toxemia). This group of infants is generally responsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a>, and the hyperinsulinemia resolves within days to months but nearly always within six months. The etiology for the dysregulation of insulin secretion in these patients remains to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Focal lesions, even those that have been localized before surgery, are often difficult to find in the pancreas during surgery. Some investigators have used intraoperative ultrasonography to identify focal lesions successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The combination of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET) and enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning has shown promising results in accurately identifying focal lesions. The detection limit is 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6 </sup>cells or a diameter of 1 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Unfortunately, this modality is only available in a limited number of institutions around the world and will reduce the number of near total pancreatectomies in infant with adenomas since a number of these children with adenomas in the head of the pancreas may require significant resection of the pancreas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;, section on 'Focal versus diffuse'</a>.)</p><p>When a focal lesion is identified, it can usually, but not always, be excised, leaving the remainder of the pancreas intact. A series of samples should be obtained from what is believed to be unaffected pancreas for histopathologic examination to determine whether the child has focal or diffuse disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Frozen section in focal disease shows beta cell crowding with small nuclei, whereas frozen section in diffuse disease shows diffuse hyperplasia of beta cells with giant nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Such frozen section diagnoses are much more difficult and require an experienced pathologist. If focal disease is detected, the lesion(s) should be identified and resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Selective resection of focal anomalies is often curative, whereas diffuse disease requires subtotal pancreatectomy, in which 95 to 99 percent of the pancreas is removed. Several reports have been published on the successful use of laparoscopic surgery for diagnosing and removal of focal lesions as well as for near total pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. This approach has several advantages compared with open surgery: it can be performed at an earlier postnatal age; the patient can be back on oral feedings within a day after surgery; and it is associated with minimal bleeding.</p><p>Surgical outcome depends upon islet cell pathology, location of lesion(s), the underlying mechanism for abnormal insulin secretion, and extent of pancreatectomy. Exogenous insulin may be required to control hyperglycemia for several weeks to months after subtotal pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On the other hand, recurrence of hypoglycemia within 24 to 48 hours of surgery indicates that establishing normal control of glucose homeostasis will most likely continue to be difficult and additional surgery may be necessary. The range of outcomes is illustrated by a series of 105 neonates and infants with congenital hyperinsulinism who underwent near-total or partial pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 58 patients with diffuse disease treated with near-total pancreatectomy, 59 percent had mild or asymptomatic hypoglycemia that responded to medical management and needed no further surgical treatment for hypoglycemia within five years. Ten patients underwent a second surgery because of persistent hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia was common initially (53 percent), and became universal within 13 years, usually requiring insulin therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 47 patients with focal disease, treated with partial pancreatectomy, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were rare, mild and transient. </p><p/><p>Careful follow-up of each patient is necessary to monitor long-term effects of subtotal pancreatectomy on pancreatic function. Exocrine function as measured by fecal elastase is impaired in most patients after near-total pancreatectomy, and about half have clinically significant fat malabsorption, with symptoms including steatorrhea and poor weight gain that respond to pancreatic enzyme replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This report suggests that routine assessment of pancreatic exocrine function and measures of fat malabsorption should become a routine part of long-term follow-up of children who have undergone near-total pancreatectomy for PHHI. In the past, many centers relied on growth parameters to monitor for the development of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, but this practice is not sufficient in this high-risk population. Endocrine function also progressively worsens and becomes severely impaired in most patients. As an example, among more than 300 children with medically unresponsive diffuse PHHI treated with near-total pancreatectomy, 96 percent had developed insulin-dependent diabetes by 11 years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. If hypoglycemia recurs after surgery, reexploration with near-total pancreatectomy should be pursued in conjunction with pharmacologic therapy as described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic sequelae, including psychomotor retardation, cognitive deficits (in short-term memory, visuomotor integration, and arithmetic skills), and epilepsy may result from repeated or prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia.

It should be pointed out that most of the patients (80 percent) had diffuse disease and therefore no meaningful conclusion can be made about differences in outcomes between diffuse and focal disease. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. PHHI is a genetic disorder with familial and sporadic forms, both of which are characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary goal of therapy in PHHI is the prevention of acute neurologic symptoms (eg, seizure, lethargy, coma) and long-term sequelae (eg, epilepsy, cognitive deficits, microcephaly) of prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment goals'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first management priority is restoration of normal plasma glucose via administration of parenteral glucose and frequent oral feedings, as appropriate. Because high rates of infusion and high concentrations of glucose may be required to avoid fluid overload, the placement of a central line should be considered early in the evaluation of such children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the plasma glucose concentration is being stabilized, pharmacologic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> and frequent oral feedings (if tolerated) should begin. The likelihood of response to diazoxide depends on the molecular defect, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107384 \">table 1</a>). Second-line pharmacologic agents (somatostatin analogues) should be added as needed. Pharmacologic therapy is most likely to be successful in patients who present beyond the neonatal period, or in those with autosomal dominant PHHI. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who can maintain normal plasma glucose concentrations with frequent feedings and pharmacologic agents should be able to tolerate an overnight fast (14 hours) without developing hypoglycemia before discharge from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Once discharged, blood glucose must be monitored at home, particularly during intercurrent illnesses; fasts of longer than 14 hours should be avoided depending upon the tolerance of the individual child. (See <a href=\"#H31077326\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial pancreatectomy can be attempted in patients who appear to have focal disease. Multiple biopsies should be taken from apparently unaffected areas of the pancreas to exclude diffuse disease. Subtotal or near total pancreatectomy should be planned for patients with diffuse disease whose hypoglycemia can only be managed with pharmacologic agents and continuous IV glucose. Patients undergoing near-total pancreatectomy generally require transient exogenous insulin therapy in the postoperative period and a significant number develop permanent diabetes mellitus within a decade after the surgery. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PHHI may cause neurologic sequelae such as psychomotor retardation, cognitive deficits (in short-term memory, visuomotor integration, and arithmetic skills), and epilepsy. These complications may be caused by repeated or prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Menni F, de Lonlay P, Sevin C, et al.
