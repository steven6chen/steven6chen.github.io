Storage of red cells has been enhanced by the development of preservative solutions; in addition, several types of components are available for use in selected circumstances to minimize complications. This topic review will discuss the storage and use of these various preparations.</p><p>The administration of RBC transfusions in adults, including issues of storage, specialized modifications, and infusion, is discussed here.

The largest study to date, which conducted a retrospective database review involving almost one million transfusion recipients, found that donor age and sex did not affect recipient mortality once the data were adjusted for the number of transfusions using a nonlinear model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These statistical adjustments were required to eliminate the confounding effects of the recipient's disease severity, which created a nonlinear relationship between the number of transfusions and the risk of death; the authors suggested that these confounding effects were responsible for an earlier report from 2016 that transfusions from female and younger donors might be associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>A separate study asked whether the prior pregnancy history of female donors affected outcomes in a cohort of 31,118 recipients of a first RBC transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among male recipients, compared with transfusion of an RBC unit collected from a male donor, transfusion of an RBC unit collected from an ever-pregnant female donor was associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26). This mortality effect persisted beyond one year, but causes of mortality were not assessed and no mechanism for the effect could be identified. These observations suggest that an effect, if present, is very weak. Therefore, the findings need to be replicated in other studies before any changes in donor screening procedures for RBC transfusions are considered. This is especially important because removal of ever-pregnant female donors would significantly reduce the supply of available RBC units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>By contrast, the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is well known to be greater with plasma or apheresis platelets (which contain a high volume of plasma) from female donors who have been pregnant, especially multiparous female donors. The likely mechanism involves a contribution of immune (antibody-mediated) neutrophil activation in many cases (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>). This observation has led to the practice of deferring multiparous female donors from donating plasma, along with other related TRALI risk mitigation procedures. Deferral of female plasma donors is possible because plasma units can be frozen, increasing shelf-life, and the supply of plasma units exceeds demand. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COLLECTION AND STORAGE PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood collections are routinely separated into various components (ie, red cells, plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets) and the RBC are stored for up to 42 days in the United States. These processes have markedly enhanced our ability to meet transfusion requirements and are due to two important developments, namely preservative solutions that allow for a long shelf-life of the red cells, and storage bags that permit separation of blood components and maintain sterility and viability of the contained red cells. These are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of Cryoprecipitate&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preservative solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preservative solutions are added to RBCs to improve their shelf-life (eg, by maintaining pH and preventing coagulation). Although it was recognized since 1916 that red cells could be stored for brief periods of time in a citrate-glucose solution, it was not until the 1930s that blood was transfused after storage, and not until 1937 that the first blood &quot;bank&quot; was established at Cook County Hospital in Chicago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the early 1940s, a major breakthrough came with the development of the first effective anticoagulant-preservative solution (A-P) ACD (acid citrate dextrose), which allowed blood to be stored for up to 21 days.</p><p>During the ensuing years, significant progress was made in the development of other A-P solutions, such as citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) for 21-day storage, CPD-adenine for 35-day storage, and the current generation of additive solutions that permit storage for 42 days. As the shelf-life of blood has been extended, the loss of collections through outdating has been progressively reduced. There have been (and continue to be) attempts to further improve the quality of RBCs during and at the end of their 42-day storage period. To this end, a newer additive solution was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, for commercial reasons, it is not in widespread use in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Storage bags</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of equal importance is the use of plastic storage bags that permit the separation of collected blood into red cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate in a closed and therefore sterile environment. These generally became available around 1960.</p><p>Today, whole blood collections are routinely separated into an average of 1.5 to 2.0 transfusable components (including frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate); furthermore, many units of plasma are made available for fractionation into plasma derivatives such as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Component separation provides the ability to support the transfusion needs of multiple patients from a single donation but has led to the virtual disappearance of the availability of whole blood from blood banks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348513434\"><span class=\"h2\">Storage temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regulations require that red cells be stored under refrigeration at controlled temperatures of 1 to 6&deg;C to maintain the viability of the red cells and to prevent the growth of bacteria. When transported between facilities (eg, from a blood collection facility to a hospital or between hospitals), the storage temperature must be maintained at 1 to 10&deg;C. When units are transported from the blood bank to another part of the hospital for transfusion, they should be transported under the same controlled temperature conditions. However, if such controlled temperature transport does not occur (ie, the units are instead maintained in a room temperature environment) and the red cell unit is subsequently returned to the blood bank because it was not transfused to the intended patient, a decision will need to be made as to whether the blood bank can reissue the unit for transfusion to another patient.</p><p>In the US there are no regulatory requirements for how long a red cell unit can be exposed to temperatures above 10&deg;C, then replaced into refrigerator storage, and subsequently reissued to another patient. In the UK, there is a requirement that the red cell unit be discarded if it has been outside of controlled storage conditions for longer than 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This requirement is based on historical data from the 1970s related to red cell quality, and on concerns about bacterial proliferation in the very uncommon circumstance where the stored red cell unit contains viable organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, studies have shown that red cell units can be maintained outside controlled temperature conditions for up to 60 minutes without either of these adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. For those hospital transfusion services that are accredited by AABB, an AABB Standard requires that each hospital establish and validate procedures to ensure that units eligible for reissue have been maintained under conditions that ensure an appropriate temperature while outside of the hospital blood bank (ie, between 1 to 6&deg;C or 1 to 10&deg;C depending on local hospital policy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4308410\"><span class=\"h2\">Freezing to preserve rare RBC units</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RBCs frozen in 40 percent glycerol are approved by the FDA and the AABB for storage at -80&ordm;C for up to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The use of this product was evaluated in a prospective, randomized trial of 57 stable trauma patients who required blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Compared with refrigerated RBC, frozen deglycerolized cells were noninferior with respect to increasing hematocrit, effects on thromboelastography parameters, and clinical outcomes.</p><p>The need to subject red cells to glycerolization and freezing, and the time and effort required for thawing and washing immediately before infusion increases cost and delays transfusion. Thus, frozen deglycerolized red cells have a limited number of indications. These include the long-term storage of &quot;rare&quot; RBC units for transfusion of individuals with uncommon blood types (eg, Bombay phenotype), and use in patients with IgA deficiency if IgA negative donors do not exist (since this process removes more plasma than simply washing the RBC). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Washed red cells to remove plasma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF STORAGE CONDITIONS ON TRANSFUSION OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022666402\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical relevance of storage time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average estimated storage duration of an RBC unit transfused in the United States ranges from 15 to 19 days. Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent outcomes with transfusion of &quot;fresh&quot; RBCs (RBCs stored for fewer days) and &quot;old&quot; RBCs (RBCs stored for a greater number of days).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco#H27658918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood warmers</strong> &ndash; For patients who require blood that is warmed (eg, those at risk of hypothermia or autoimmune cold-induced hemolysis), blood warmers that raise the temperature closer to body temperature are used. These must be calibrated and monitored to avoid heating of the blood cells above 40&deg;C, which will cause hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Prevention of hypothermia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of blood products in the critically ill&quot;, section on 'Hypothermia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post-transfusion hemoglobin level</strong> &ndash; The post-transfusion hemoglobin level may be accurately measured as early as 15 minutes following transfusion, as long as the patient is not actively bleeding. This practice is based on studies showing a high degree of concordance between values measured 15 minutes after the transfusion versus longer intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. In the inpatient setting, a post-transfusion hemoglobin either may be obtained soon after transfusion or may wait until a routinely ordered laboratory blood draw. A post transfusion hemoglobin may be drawn on outpatients but is not needed in all circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Observation following transfusion</strong> &ndash; In addition to observing the patient during transfusion, inpatients will continue to be observed for 15 to 30 minutes post-transfusion. The situation with outpatients is more variable and dependent on local institutional procedures; some institutions will observe for this length of time but others will release the patient sooner (eg, after the final set of vital signs is taken, especially if the patient has been routinely transfused at the same facility in the past).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3741346438\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Whole blood should be considered only when dealing with an adult who has bled acutely and massively. (See <a href=\"#H904532\" class=\"local\">'Packed RBCs versus whole blood'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additive solutions and blood <span class=\"nowrap\">collection/storage</span> bags permit storage of RBC for 42 days.

However, several randomized trials have found no difference in outcomes using RBCs of shorter storage duration versus longer storage duration. Thus, there is no reason to alter transfusion practice toward the use of fresher RBCs. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Effect of storage conditions on transfusion outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1022666402\" class=\"local\">'Clinical relevance of storage time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available RBC modifications include irradiation, leukoreduction, and washing to remove plasma.
