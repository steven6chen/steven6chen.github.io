A cataract is an opacity of the lens of the eye that causes partial or total blindness. The word derives from the Latin &quot;catarractes,&quot; which means &quot;waterfall&quot;; to the naked eye of an observer, the foamy white opacity of an advanced cataract, seen through the pupil, resembles the turbulent water of a waterfall.</p><p>Modern microsurgical technique allows intervention for cataract before it has resulted in blindness; normal vision typically is restored with intraocular lens implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Except in certain very uncommon situations, delay in treatment does not result in an adverse outcome. The major advances in the surgical treatment of cataract in the last century have not been matched by advances in the understanding of cataract formation, in approaches to prevention, or in nonsurgical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic models estimate that there are approximately 30 million blind people in the world, 50 percent of whom are blind due to cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pattern and rate of blinding disorders is different in developed and developing nations depending upon whether nutritional and infectious causes of blindness are eradicated and whether there are resources available for treatable disorders such as cataract.</p><p>The definition of blindness is different for international health purposes than it is for social and rehabilitative purposes in the United States. The least-developed nations are estimated to have a 1 percent rate of blindness using the international definition; developed nations are thought to have a 0.2 percent rate of blindness. Blindness by international health standards is defined as the inability to count fingers at 10 feet; this converts to <span class=\"nowrap\">10/200</span> by Snellen notation, which means that a patient can see at 10 feet what a normal person would see at 200 feet. This level of vision allows ambulation but does not allow the reading of print of any size. The standard for legal blindness in the United States is <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span>. This standard is lower than the international standard, meaning it is easier to qualify as &quot;blind.&quot; Individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span> vision can ambulate, and some can read print with appropriate low-vision aids.</p><p>The Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group (EDPRG) estimated causes of blindness and visual impairment in the United States by applying the results of population-based studies conducted in North America, Western Europe, and Australia between 1990 and 2001 to the population structure of the United States based on the year 2000 census [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The EDPRG estimated that 0.78 percent of people older than age 40 in the United States were blind by the US definition and an additional 1.98 percent had low vision, with a best corrected visual acuity between <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span>. Cataract was associated with approximately 50 percent of cases of low vision. Using a definition of cataract that did not require visual impairment, the EDPRG estimated that in 2000 there were 20.5 million people over 40 in the United States (17.2 percent) with cataract in either eye and projected that this number would rise to 30.1 million by 2020 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The 10-year incidence of cataract has been reported as 72 percent from a longitudinal study of people over age 49 in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and 54 percent for a United States population aged 43 to 86 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryonic development and lifelong growth of the lens of the eye produce a structure composed of specialized cells arranged in a highly ordered complex manner. These cells are stratified epithelia and have a very high content of cytoplasmic protein. These proteins, the crystallins, along with the complex structure, impart transparency to the lens.</p><p>Unlike other epithelia, the lens does not shed its nonviable cells. Thus, it is particularly susceptible to the degenerative effects of aging on cell structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some of the anatomic and ultrastructural correlates of lens opacity are known, although exact pathogenetic mechanisms are not. Epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggests that photo-oxidative insult, perhaps potentiated by toxic or sensitizing substances, plays a role.</p><p>The vast majority of cataract extractions are for acquired cataract, with senile or age-related cataract predominating. Risk factors that have been associated with acquired cataract in developed nations include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol consumption</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunlight exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor lifestyle habits, including malnutrition and physical inactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic corticosteroid use and possibly prolonged administration of high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Statin use, although data conflict about this association (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration&quot;, section on 'Other'</a>)</p><p/><p>Most of these risk factors are environmental stressors that lead to the formation of toxins or the impairment of antioxidants, although low education has no obvious biologic link. A dose-response relationship has been demonstrated with ultraviolet-B exposure in sunlight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The size of the risk associated with duration of exposure to diabetes has not been quantified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A dose-response relationship has also been demonstrated with smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Assuming a roughly twofold increased risk of cataract associated with smoking, approximately 20 percent of cataract cases are attributable to smoking in the United States population. Some damage to the lens caused by smoking may be reversible upon quitting, although the reduction in cataract risk associated with smoking cessation is primarily due to limiting further dose-related damage to the lens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Other environmental stressors may be involved as well. Low-level accumulated lead exposure, at levels commonly experienced by adults in the United States, appears to be associated with an increased risk of cataract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Other generally accepted causes of acquired or secondary cataract include ocular trauma (traumatic cataract), uveitis, scleritis (particularly necrotizing scleritis), radiation of an intraocular tumor, systemic disease such as myotonic dystrophy, and use of topical corticosteroids, certain phenothiazines, and topical anticholinesterases (toxic cataract). Patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> may develop cataracts at an earlier age compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The indication for surgical intervention in these types of acquired cataract is the same as for age-related cataract (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgery'</a> below). Some forms of acquired cataract, such as that related to trauma or uveitis, require modification of standard surgical technique, but in most cases special surgical considerations are not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of age-related cataract is a painless, progressive process that is highly variable among individuals. Cataract formation is typically bilateral, although it is often asymmetrical. Patients usually complain of a problem with night driving, reading road signs, or difficulty with fine print.</p><p>In many cases, there is an increase in nearsightedness before there is opacity of the lens that degrades vision. This increase in nearsightedness, called a &quot;myopic shift,&quot; is caused by an increase in the refractive power of a lens that is gradually becoming cataractous and can continue as opacity develops. The myopic shift may be correctable with a change in spectacle correction; the lens opacity is not correctable in this manner. Surgery should be deferred as long as diminished acuity can be corrected with spectacles to meet a patient's needs; in rare cases, the patient may not tolerate the full correction of refractive error because the result is imbalanced with respect to the fellow eye, and cataract surgery is chosen without first dispensing full correction.</p><p>Age-related cataract typically has three components: nuclear sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51557\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51557 \">picture 1</a>), cortical spoking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56676\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56676 \">picture 2</a>), and posterior subcapsular haze (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72677\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72677 \">picture 3</a>). Each affects a different anatomical part of the lens and has different symptoms and progression, although the indication for intervention with all types is the same (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70532\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70532 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nuclear cataract</strong> &ndash; Nuclear cataract progresses very slowly. Distance vision typically is affected much more than near vision. It is not unusual to find individuals in their 80s with nuclear cataract degrading acuity to the <span class=\"nowrap\">20/70</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">20/100</span> level, with near vision preserved at the <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span> level. Such an individual may not be particularly aware of or bothered by the decreased vision from cataract if he or she does not drive. Nuclear cataract also dulls colors and white significantly; this is rarely a patient complaint until after the first cataract is removed, at which time the effect on color is noted by comparison with the brightness of colors in the operated eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cortical cataract</strong> &ndash; Although it is a prominent finding on biomicroscopic examination, cortical cataract does not degrade vision very much.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior subcapsular cataract</strong> &ndash; Posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) tends to cause disabling glare in bright sunlight and from headlights, even if visual acuity is degraded only slightly. Systemic and topical steroid use is associated with formation of this type of cataract (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>). PSC tends to progress more quickly than nuclear cataract (over a period of months rather than years); the explanation for this pattern of progression is not known.</p><p/><p>A cataract that still allows a view of the retina and transmits a red reflex is called an immature cataract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53639\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53639 \">picture 4</a>); once the red reflex is lost, it is called mature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71657\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71657 \">picture 5</a>). A mature cataract degrades vision to the <span class=\"nowrap\">20/400</span> level or worse. A hypermature cataract is one in which the cortex of the lens has liquefied and the lens nucleus is mobile within the capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62426\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62426 \">picture 6</a>). A moderate to advanced cataract can interfere with the diagnosis and therapy of diseases involving the retina and optic nerve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary glaucoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small fraction of mature and hypermature cataracts can give rise to secondary glaucoma. Three rare types of intractable glaucoma may occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phacolytic glaucoma, in which lysed lens proteins cause a pressure rise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma, in which the autoimmune reaction to these proteins causes a pressure rise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phacomorphic glaucoma, in which the swollen lens causes a form of angle closure glaucoma</p><p/><p>These types of glaucoma cause a red, painful eye; they are not asymptomatic like many other glaucomas. Since this complication is not subtle, the presence of a mature cataract is not necessarily an indication for cataract surgery if it remains asymptomatic in a patient who for other reasons had little useful vision in the affected eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cataract should be suspected in any patient who complains of a painless, progressive decline in vision. A lens opacity can be confirmed by a nondilated fundus examination with the direct ophthalmoscope; there may be darkening of the red reflex, opacities within the red reflex, or obscuration of ocular fundus detail. In the absence of other visual symptoms, a red eye, or other abnormality noted on fundus examination, these patients should be referred on a nonurgent basis for comprehensive ophthalmic examination.</p><p>A comprehensive ophthalmologic examination begins with a history of visual complaints, including the patient's ability to meet his or her visual needs. Subjective refraction should be attempted to monitor for myopic shift and to see if a change in spectacles would improve vision. The type and extent of lens opacity is noted, and a dilated fundus examination is performed to rule out the presence of other pathology that could account for diminished vision. A diagnosis of visually significant cataract is made if no other pathology is detected and the degree of lens opacity correlates with the patient's complaints and best-corrected visual acuity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=slit-lamp-examination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Slit lamp examination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most cases of cataract occur in patients over age 60 or in younger individuals who have risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, systemic steroid use, or a history of significant eye trauma (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above); these individuals should be and are typically seen annually by an ophthalmologist to monitor for asymptomatic conditions such as open-angle glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Patients with known cataract and no specific complaint are followed at intervals determined by their risk for glaucoma or other eye disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no proven therapy to either prevent cataract formation or slow progression of lens opacity once it develops. However, observational studies suggest that some interventions may be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a healthy diet is associated with a lower risk of developing nuclear cataract in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Healthy diet in this study was based on US dietary guidelines from the 1992 food pyramid which places emphasis on major food groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, meat), as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">total/saturated</span> fat, cholesterol, and sodium intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diets rich in lutein, zeaxanthin, and B vitamins are associated with a decreased risk of cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This relationship might reflect other benefits of diets high in fruits and vegetables, or lifestyle factors associated with such a diet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing nuclear cataract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk for cataract extraction over time, although risk had not returned to baseline even two decades after smoking cessation in a cohort study of over 40,000 Swedish men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal estrogen use (longer than 10 years) may reduce the risk of nuclear cataracts, although there are significant concerns about the long-term use of estrogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Several interventions that have been suggested for prevention have not been proven to prevent cataracts. There is no evidence that any particular type of sunglasses is effective or superior in the prevention of cataract or slowing cataract progression. Increased dietary glycemic load is not associated with risk for cataract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and no studies have been performed to evaluate whether blood sugar control in patients with diabetes correlates with cataract risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin supplementation</strong> &ndash; Multiple randomized trials have investigated whether vitamin supplementation can prevent cataracts with mixed results. A 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized trials evaluating one or more antioxidant vitamins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>) for at least one year, with follow-up for 2 to 12 years, found no evidence that vitamin supplementation reduced the risk of cataract or of cataract extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial in over 11,000 men with a mean 5.6 years of treatment and follow-up found no benefit of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> or vitamin E supplementation in the prevention of cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, another randomized trial found evidence of benefit from long-term multivitamin use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The trial involving over 14,000 male physicians aged 50 and older followed for an average of 11 years, found a modest decrease in the risk of cataract (872 versus 945 cataracts in multivitamin and placebo groups respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.99) with long-term daily multivitamin use.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE MEDICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cataract surgery is a low-risk procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but the surgery is typically performed on older adults. In this population, multiple medical morbidities increase the risk of any procedure. In a systematic review of 21,531 total cataract surgeries, 707 adverse medical events related to the surgery were reported, resulting in three deaths and 61 hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining a routine &quot;battery&quot; of tests is not necessary in patients undergoing cataract extraction. A systematic review of three randomized trials (21,531 cataract surgeries) found that routine preoperative medical testing increased surgical costs but did not reduce the risk of intraoperative or postoperative medical adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The largest trial among the three involved 19,557 surgeries and reported complication rates of 31.3 events per 1000 operations for patients randomly assigned either to testing or no routine testing; results did not differ when stratified by age, sex, race, or physical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbid conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age alone is not a contraindication to cataract surgery.

Patients with diabetes should preferably undergo surgery in the early morning to avoid hypoglycemia; insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs can then be held until after surgery.

In general, patients can be continued on their antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the decision to continue or discontinue these medications should be made after discussion with the ophthalmologist who is performing the surgery.

In a prospective cohort study of 19,584 cataract surgeries in patients 50 years of age and older, there were 4517 patients routinely taking aspirin prior to surgery, of whom 3363 continued aspirin within 14 days of surgery and 977 discontinued aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The rate of ocular hemorrhagic events in patients who continued aspirin was similar to that in patients not routinely taking aspirin (0.56 versus 0.59 events per 1000 surgeries). Patients who discontinued aspirin prior to surgery also had no evidence of increased stroke, transient ischemic attacks, or thromboembolic events compared with those who continued aspirin (1.02 versus 1.49 per 1000 surgeries) and had a somewhat lower rate of myocardial ischemia and infarction (1.02 versus 5.06 per 1000 surgeries).</p><p>The higher rate of events in those who continued <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> suggests that there was confounding in the study in that those who discontinued aspirin were probably a lower risk group at baseline.

It is important to make sure the surgeon is aware that the patient was or is taking an alpha-1 antagonist, as intraoperative regimens can reduce IFIS. Most surgeons do not insist that these agents be discontinued, as discontinuing the medication prior to cataract surgery has not been shown to prevent or decrease the severity of IFIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. IFIS has been reported years after the discontinuation of alpha-1 antagonists.

There is no technical advantage to taking out a cataract sooner. Except in cases in which cataract limits monitoring for retinal or optic nerve disease, or in the rare instance in which it is inducing glaucoma, the choice of whether to pursue surgery should be determined by the informed patient rather than the surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Prior to the development of modern intraocular lenses and surgical techniques, patients were often told that they must wait for surgery until their cataract was &quot;ripe.&quot; Cataract extraction in that era was deferred until the vision was poor in both eyes. Surgery involved greater risk to the eye and required several weeks of immobilization. This is no longer necessary.</p><p>The ophthalmologist must assess what proportion or aspect of diminished vision is accounted for by cataract in the presence of coexistent pathology such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy. Even if it seems that cataract accounts only partially for loss of vision, surgery may be indicated if the other disease process is under control and the patient understands that the prognosis for complete recovery of visual acuity is guarded. Many patients with impaired vision from cataract and AMD or diabetic retinopathy do have significant improvement in visual function after cataract extraction, even when coexistent retinal disease precludes recovery of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/20</span> vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Adjunctive tests that can be done preoperatively, such as the potential acuity meter (PAM), may provide useful information in advising whether cataract surgery is likely to yield improvement in vision in patients with coexistent pathology. Retrospective data suggest that cataract surgery for patients with wet AMD can improve vision, but that close monitoring is warranted postoperatively because of a trend toward increased macular thickening or intraretinal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery on second eye</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about health care expenditures have raised questions regarding the value of performing cataract surgery on a second eye after successful surgery on the first eye.

However, there were major benefits for the second surgery group in terms of reported visual symptoms and quality of life. A retrospective study comparing immediate (same day) with delayed (within one year) surgery on the second eye found no difference in postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, refractive error, or complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A retrospective population-based study found that visual outcomes were better for bilateral, compared with unilateral, cataract surgery only when the second eye had a significant cataract or poor visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Another analysis concluded that surgery on a second eye is highly cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cataract surgery typically is performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia with monitored intravenous sedation at a hospital or ambulatory surgicenter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

A 2017 systematic review of periprocedural antibiotic therapy found that intracameral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> with or without topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> lowers the risk of endophthalmitis after surgery (high-certainty evidence) and that antibiotic eye drops in addition to an antibiotic injection lowers the risk of endophthalmitis compared with using an injection or eye drops alone (moderate-certainty evidence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A retrospective study of over 600,000 cataract surgeries showed that the risk of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients who had received intracameral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> was lower than in those who did not receive it (0.02 versus 0.07 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Two techniques are most commonly used for cataract extraction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Standard extracapsular cataract extraction</strong> &ndash; This typically involves removal of the lens nucleus in one piece. The lens cortex is aspirated from the eye and the lens capsule is left behind to support an intraocular lens. A rigid plastic lens is inserted through the same incision and placed on or in the capsule, behind the iris.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Phacoemulsification</strong> &ndash; Also called small incision surgery, the lens is fragmented using ultrasound energy and aspirated from the eye through a small incision. The cortex is aspirated and the lens capsule is left behind as in extracapsular cataract extraction. A foldable plastic or silicone lens may be passed through the smaller incision, or the incision can be extended to accommodate a larger, rigid plastic lens. The small incision may be self-sealing, requiring one or even no sutures. Phacoemulsification has the advantage of more rapid visual recovery due to the small incision size and decreased likelihood of suture-induced astigmatism.</p><p/><p>While phacoemulsification is commonly performed in developed countries, it is technology-dependent and relatively costly. These factors create barriers to care in the developing world, where cataracts cause 50 to 80 percent of blindness. A systematic review comparing phacoemulsification with extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) for age-related cataract found lower complication rates with phacoemulsification, but that lower costs for ECCE support its use when high-volume surgery is important, since differences in visual outcomes for the two procedures were small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>A patient and surgeon may choose phacoemulsification under topical anesthesia for its apparent short-term advantages.

The alternatives to lens implantation (aphakic spectacles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71082 \">picture 7</a>) or contact lenses), however, are unsatisfactory for most patients.</p><p>There are three types of IOL, monofocal, multifocal, or accommodative, that can be implanted. The multifocal and accommodative lenses are newer options. In a 2012 systematic review of 18 trials (16 completed, 2 ongoing) that compared monofocal and multifocal lenses, improvements in distance visual acuity were similar with the two types of lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Multifocal IOL conferred better near vision and more freedom from having to use glasses. However, patients with multifocal IOL reported more adverse visual effects (eg, haloes). Meta-analysis could not be performed because of methodologic and statistical heterogeneity among the trials. In a subsequent randomized trial comparing multifocal IOL with monofocal lenses adjusted to provide monovision (normal refraction in one eye and myopia in the other to improve near vision), patients with the multifocal lens were less likely to require glasses but more likely to undergo exchange lens implantation because of side effects (glare) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A 2014 systematic review of four trials in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany comparing accommodative IOL with monofocal IOL found moderate-quality evidence of small gains in near vision after six months with accommodative IOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Distance vision at 12 months may be reduced, but this may be related to confounding factors. More data are needed to determine the relative benefits of monofocal, multifocal, and accommodative lenses.

Many surgeons allow resumption of driving at the level immediately prior to surgery at this time, as long as continued patching is not required.</p><p>Recommendations on physical activity restriction vary widely among surgeons depending upon their confidence in the technique used. Patients with large incisions typically are advised not to undertake heavy lifting or strenuous activity for several weeks to several months. Surgeons who perform phacoemulsification tend to restrict activity for a period of days to weeks. Most patients are able to return to work by one week unless driving or heavy lifting is required. There are no evidence-based data for these recommendations.</p><p>Patients typically are seen one day, one week, and one month after surgery to monitor for complications and proper healing.

A meta-analysis found that biomaterials and edge design may influence posterior capsule opacification; incidence was lower for acrylic or silicone lenses and for those with sharp optic edges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) is inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye, occurring typically within 24 hours of surgery and related to noninfectious contaminants of equipment, solutions, or other supplies used during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Clusters of cases have been traced to faulty preparation of sterilization equipment.</p><p/><p>Because of the frequency with which cataract surgery is performed in the United States (1 million cases annually), even the infrequent complications affect large numbers of people. One study based on Canadian administrative claims data found that adverse events were lower for surgeons who performed more cataract procedures (adverse event rate within 14 days of surgery 0.8 percent for surgeons performing 50 to 250 cataract surgeries per year; 0.1 percent for those performing more than 1000 cataract surgeries per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Other reports examined the factors that were predictive of the outcome of cataract surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. In one prospective cohort, age &gt;75, good visual function, low symptom score, and ocular comorbidities all independently increased the likelihood of no improvement in visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In another prospective cohort study designed to create decision trees for appropriateness of cataract surgery, poor preintervention visual acuity and negative surgical complexity were predictors of significant improvement in visual acuity after cataract surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>The Cataract Patient Outcome Research Team reported on the rigor of research methods in studies of the effectiveness and safety of cataract extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Their review suggested that the rigor of evidence regarding the outcomes of cataract surgery performed by alternative techniques was suboptimal. In particular, most of the published studies on outcomes of cataract surgery were not designed with a control or comparison group. There were problems with patient selection bias, lack of standardized assessment of outcome, and lack of standard definitions of complications and measures of their clinical significance. Studies of large numbers of eyes were just as susceptible to these problems as those of smaller numbers, and the rigor of studies did not show improvement between 1979 and 1991.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of macular degeneration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns have been raised that patients undergoing cataract surgery may be at increased risk for AMD. Proposed mechanisms include an increased susceptibility to light damage, inflammatory changes secondary to surgery, or induction of angiogenesis.</p><p>A 2017 systematic review concluded that it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Pooled data from two observational studies including 6019 patients with five years of follow-up concluded that the risk of developing late-stage AMD in eyes that had undergone cataract surgery was substantially increased (odds ratio [OR] 5.7, 95% CI 2.4-13.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. These results may potentially be confounded by the fact that AMD and cataracts have common risk factors. The study controlled for such confounding in a multivariate model; however, residual confounding is possible. Additionally, some cases of newly diagnosed or progressed AMD following cataract surgery may represent prior disease that was not recognized because of lens opacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Further studies will be needed to define whether the association between AMD and cataract surgery is causal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost of cataract surgery is born, for the most part, by Medicare, since it is predominantly performed on individuals over the age of 65. In 1990, it was the most frequently performed surgical procedure in the Medicare population; more than 1 million procedures were performed yearly in Medicare beneficiaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. One analysis projected that in 1991 Medicare spent USD $3.3 billion on cataract surgery (with a median allowed charge of approximately $2500 for a &quot;typical&quot; episode of cataract surgery), $39 million on preoperative ophthalmological tests, $7 million on postoperative ophthalmological tests, and more than $18 million on perioperative medical services, for a total estimated expenditure of $3.4 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The rate of reimbursement to hospitals, surgicenters, and surgeons does not vary by technique used. There have been no analyses of the benefit or effectiveness of the Medicare expenditure for cataract surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16665471\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness of surgery and impact from population studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cataract surgery has been found to be cost-effective in its effect on quality-adjusted life years gained compared with other medical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In one analysis, the cost utility for first eye cataract surgery in Western countries was calculated to range from $245 to <span class=\"nowrap\">$22,000/quality-adjusted</span> life year and from $9 to $1600 in developing countries, with variation depending on the model applied for discounting over time and the surgical costs of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].</p><p>Cataract surgery may result in benefits for older adults, beyond improved vision and resulting improved quality of life. Data from a Medicare database, comparing hip fracture rates in patients with cataract who did or did not undergo cataract surgery, found a 16 percent decrease in the adjusted OR for hip fracture within one year in patients who had surgery and a 23 percent decrease for patients with severe cataract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. A cohort study suggested that cataract surgery reduces the number of motor vehicle crashes in older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. However, the impact was relatively small (reduction of 4.74 crashes per million miles) and other confounding factors may have played a role in the outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Fifty percent of blindness globally is estimated to be caused by cataract. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for cataract include older age, smoking, poor lifestyle habits, alcohol consumption, sunlight exposure, lower educational status, diabetes mellitus, and systemic and possibly high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataract formation is usually bilateral and presents with problems with night driving, reading road signs, or difficulty with fine print. There is often an increase in myopia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataract should be suspected in any patient who complains of painless progressive decline in vision. Most cases of cataract occur in patients over age 60 or in younger individuals who have risk factors. Diagnosis is by comprehensive eye examination; a dilated fundus examination should be performed to rule out other pathology that could account for diminished vision. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataract surgery is a low-risk procedure. Extensive preoperative evaluation is not indicated, but blood pressure should be controlled in hypertensive patients; endocarditis prophylaxis is not necessary. As the risk of bleeding is low, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or anticoagulants may be continued for most patients. The decision to continue or discontinue these medications should be made after discussion with the ophthalmologist who is performing the surgery. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative medical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) is seen in patients treated with alpha-1 antagonists; it is important that the surgeon be aware when patients have been taking alpha blockers since special surgical protocols can be used to reduce risk for IFIS. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Medications and intraoperative floppy iris syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is indicated when symptoms from the cataract interfere with the patient's ability to meet his or her needs of daily living. Surgery is typically on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia with monitored sedation. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small incision surgery, involving phacoemulsification of the lens and implantation of a synthetic intraocular lens, is the most commonly performed technique for cataract surgery in developed countries. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), including the variant manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), may be performed at the surgeon's preference or based on resources available in the developing world. Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) typically does not allow for intraocular lens (IOL) placement and requires aphakic spectacle correction; it is typically performed only in the developing world and only when there is no option for IOL placement. (See <a href=\"#H32248167\" class=\"local\">'Surgery in developing countries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are typically seen on the first postoperative day and then one week and one month post-surgery. Most surgeons advise restricted physical activity for days to weeks, though there is scant evidence basis for this. The final prescription for glasses is determined at one to three months. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infrequent complications include endophthalmitis, lens <span class=\"nowrap\">malposition/dislocation,</span> cystoid macular edema, and retinal detachment. An association exists between cataract surgery and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but causality is not known. (See <a href=\"#H106886595\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Thylefors B, N&eacute;grel AD, Pararajasegaram R, Dadzie KY.
