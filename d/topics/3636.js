The third edition of the ICSD (ICSD-3) includes seven major categories of sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related breathing disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central disorders of hypersomnolence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasomnias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related movement disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other sleep disorders</p><p/><p>ICSD-3 includes 60 specific diagnoses within the seven major categories, as well as an appendix for classification of sleep disorders associated with medical and neurologic disorders. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) codes corresponding to each specific diagnosis can be found within the ICSD-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, pediatric diagnoses are not distinguished from adult diagnoses except for sleep-related breathing disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The ICSD-3 complements and refers to the regularly updated Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events, published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) also classifies sleep disorders in a manner that largely parallels the ICSD-3 system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INSOMNIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ICSD-3 identifies three distinct types of insomnia: short-term insomnia, chronic insomnia, and other insomnia (when the patient has insomnia symptoms but does not meet criteria for the other two types of insomnia). Previous editions had subclassified chronic insomnia into primary and comorbid types, but these were eliminated in the ICSD-3 because they did not improve diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618724394\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic insomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ICSD-3 consolidates all chronic insomnia diagnoses under a single disorder, chronic insomnia disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Chronic insomnia requires a report of a sleep initiation or sleep maintenance problem, an adequate opportunity and circumstances to sleep, and daytime consequences as the result of the insomnia symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Types of insomnia'</a>.)</p><p>To meet diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia disorder, the patient should have symptoms at least three times per week over a duration of three or more months. Since insomnia is a component of many psychiatric and medical conditions, a diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder should be considered only when the insomnia is very prominent and requires further evaluation and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H804552111\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term insomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of short-term insomnia must meet the same criteria as chronic insomnia except that the symptoms have been present for less than three months. The development is often temporarily related to a significant stressor. To make this diagnosis, the insomnia must be an independent focus for the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require separate clinical attention. This type of insomnia often resolves when the stressor does, or when the patient develops adequate coping mechanisms or adapts to the stressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-sleep-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The criteria for this disorder include the demonstration of primarily OSA during diagnostic polysomnography. Upon initiation of treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) without a backup rate, there is emergence or persistence of central apneic events despite resolution of obstructive sleep apnea. These central apneic events also cannot be attributed to another identifiable comorbidity such as Cheyne-Stokes breathing or use of a substance (eg, opioids).</p><p>Note that some patients may have central apneic events which emerge during initial PAP titration, often when transitioning from wake to sleep. These central events may resolve with implementation of and good adherence to PAP therapy (usually within one month). Verification that these central apneas have resolved can often be made with PAP machine downloads during clinical follow-up.

In adults with medical or psychiatric comorbidities (eg, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes, cognitive dysfunction, or mood disorder) or signs or symptoms including excessive sleepiness, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insomnia, the diagnosis of OSA can be made when there are five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events per hour.

HSAT procedures measure the respiratory disturbance index based on recording time. Thus, HSAT may underestimate respiratory event frequency because recording time, and not sleep time, is utilized for the calculation of the index. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pediatric criteria for OSA require that at least one clinical finding (snoring, labored breathing, apnea, daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, or other findings) is present. Polysomnographic criteria require the presence of one or more obstructive events per hour of sleep or, alternatively, evidence of obstructive hypoventilation (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;50 mmHg for &gt;25 percent of sleep time and associated snoring, flattening of nasal airway pressure waveform, or paradoxical thoraco-abdominal movement).

In addition, there must be evidence of REM sleep without atonia during polysomnography. Clinical findings of RBD may also be noted in patients taking certain medications (such as selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). In these patients, the diagnosis of RBD is still made (and not parasomnia due to medication or substance) if the diagnostic criteria for RBD are met. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nightmare disorder is characterized by recurrent, highly dysphoric or anxiety-laden dreams that are clearly recalled upon awakening and result in significant distress or impairment. Nightmares are a common element of other disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder. This diagnosis is made only when the nightmares become a focus of clinical attention or require independent treatment.
