A viral infection associated with the common cold is the most frequent etiology of acute rhinosinusitis, more properly called viral rhinosinusitis.

Although acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) also may resolve without treatment, treatment with antibiotics hastens recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The terms &quot;sinusitis&quot; and &quot;rhinosinusitis&quot; often are used interchangeably because inflammation of the paranasal sinuses is almost always accompanied by inflammation of the nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Inflammation of the sinuses is common during upper respiratory infection but usually resolves spontaneously.

Chronic rhinosinusitis may be related to noninfectious conditions such as allergy, cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, gastroesophageal reflux, or exposure to environmental pollutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Chronic rhinosinusitis is discussed separately.

It is estimated that approximately 6 to 9 percent of viral upper respiratory infections in children are complicated by the development of a secondary bacterial rhinosinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-12</a>]. These proportions translate into a large number of infected individuals and substantial medical expenditures.</p><p>In children, ABRS typically occurs at four to seven years of age, but it can occur at any age, even infancy (complications of ethmoid sinusitis occasionally are observed in infants). ABRS is less common in children younger than two years of age than in older children. Two factors contribute to the decreased prevalence of ABRS in younger children. First, in younger children, the viral antecedent infection predisposes to acute otitis media (AOM) and treatment of AOM with antibiotics prevents the viral infection from evolving to ABRS. Second, the sinus ostia are larger (relative to the body of the sinus) than in older children (and therefore less likely to cause obstruction).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The paranasal sinuses are usually sterile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. However, because the membranes that line the nose are continuous with the membranes that line the sinus cavities, the paranasal sinuses may be contaminated with bacteria that colonize the nasal mucosa and nasopharynx. The contaminating bacteria are typically removed by mucociliary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When mucociliary clearance is altered (eg, by conditions that damage the ciliary epithelium or affect the number or function of cilia, the production or viscosity of mucous, or the patency of the ostia), the sinuses may be inoculated with large numbers of microorganisms, and infection may develop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDISPOSING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral upper respiratory infection (URI) is the most important risk factor for the development of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].

URI and allergic rhinitis contribute to the development of ABRS through mucosal congestion and possibly by depressing the local and systemic immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].
