This immune process can also affect non-exocrine organs, including the kidneys, producing an interstitial nephritis and defects in tubular function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The reported prevalence of renal involvement has varied widely, ranging from 2 to 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. This variability is due in part to different definitions of kidney involvement. In a renal biopsy series of 25 patients, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome preceded renal manifestations by a median of 5.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Twenty-two patients were female, and the median age at the time of biopsy was 55 years. Thirteen patients had proteinuria &gt;1 g, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> was seen in 21 patients; more than half the patients had eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. In another series, renal involvement occurred in 4.9 percent of 715 patients with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, with glomerular involvement occurring more frequently than tubulointerstitial disease; 37 percent had interstitial nephritis alone, 49 percent had glomerulonephritis alone, and 14 percent had both. The prognosis appears to be worse in patients with predominantly glomerular involvement, with lower survival rates and higher incidence of lymphoma, compared with patients with predominantly tubulointerstitial involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most common renal manifestation of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. The interstitial nephritis in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is characterized histologically by an interstitial infiltrate that can invade and damage the tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. In some cases, granuloma formation is seen, and there may be a concurrent uveitis, suggesting the possible presence of sarcoidosis or the tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More chronic disease is associated with tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The glomeruli are usually normal, although an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis has rarely been described&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Glomerular disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of the interstitial nephritis include a variable but generally mild elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration, a relatively benign urinalysis, and abnormalities in tubular function, including the Fanconi syndrome, distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (RTA), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (tubular resistance to antidiuretic hormone), and hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/8,11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-17</a>].</p><p>There are few data defining the optimal treatment of interstitial nephritis in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. In the absence of such data, it seems reasonable to prescribe a course of glucocorticoids if the interstitial nephritis is severe and active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; stabilization or improvement in renal function has been reported anecdotally. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a>, starting at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (up to 60 mg per day), has been used followed by a taper according to clinical response. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> maintenance therapy at doses of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> can be instituted as a steroid-sparing agent in patients who appear to be steroid dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal renal tubular acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A defect in distal acidification occurs in up to 25 percent of patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. The associated metabolic acidosis is usually mild, but some patients present with a plasma bicarbonate concentration below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and a plasma potassium concentration below 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> due to concurrent urinary potassium wasting. A brief review of the mechanisms by which distal acidification might be impaired and the effect of these abnormalities on distal potassium secretion is available elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a>). Muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest have been reported as consequences of the severe hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]; in some cases, hypokalemic paralysis has been the presenting symptom of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome leads to distal RTA is incompletely understood. Several patients have been described in whom immunocytochemical analysis of tissue obtained by renal biopsy showed complete absence of the H-ATPase pump in the intercalated cells in the collecting tubules that is largely responsible for distal proton secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. How the immune injury leads to loss of H-ATPase activity is not known. Another possible mechanism is the presence of high titers of an autoantibody directed against carbonic anhydrase II; inhibition of this enzyme would result in the generation within the cell of fewer hydrogen ions available for secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Some patients present with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis due to distal RTA without a prior diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is therefore important to consider the possible presence of this disorder in any adult with otherwise unexplained distal RTA since treatment aimed at the immunologic disease (as described above) may at least partially correct the acidification defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of distal (type 1) and proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial nephritis'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations and treatment of patients with distal RTA are discussed elsewhere.

Once again, patients may present with these complaints rather than a sicca syndrome. It is therefore important to exclude Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome in any adult with symptomatic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus who does not have the two most common causes of this disorder: chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> ingestion or hypercalcemia.

The primary defect is thought to be sodium wasting, which has two effects that augment potassium secretion: It increases sodium delivery to the potassium secretory site in the collecting tubules and, via volume depletion, enhances the release of aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>This mechanism is different from that in RTA, and these patients can acidify the urine normally and do not have metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular involvement is much less common than interstitial nephritis in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous nephropathy (MN) are the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/6,8,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,20-22</a>].

The pathogenesis of the glomerular disease, including the possible etiologic relationship to Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, is unclear but may be related to the deposition of circulating immune complexes, sometimes with underlying cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>].
