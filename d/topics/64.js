Intertriginous sites, such as the neck and axillae, are common sites for involvement. Less frequently, acanthosis nigricans appears in other skin sites or on mucosal surfaces.</p><p>Clinical recognition of acanthosis nigricans is important because the disorder can occur in association with a variety of systemic abnormalities, many of which are characterized by insulin resistance. Obesity and diabetes mellitus are among the most frequently associated disorders. Rarely, acanthosis nigricans develops as a sign of internal malignancy.</p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acanthosis nigricans will be reviewed here.

Abnormalities involving three types of tyrosine kinase receptors, insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGFR1), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), have been proposed as potential contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The association of acanthosis nigricans with multiple disorders characterized by insulin resistance suggests that hyperinsulinemia plays a key role in the development of acanthosis nigricans. Elevated levels of insulin may stimulate keratinocyte and dermal fibroblast proliferation via interaction with IGFR1, resulting in the plaque-like lesions that typify the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Acanthosis nigricans related to genetic syndromes of insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or other disorders associated with insulin resistance may be attributable to this theory (see <a href=\"#H464423\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above). These theories are supported by the finding of inherited form of acanthosis nigricans due to a homozygous mutation in the insulin receptor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Other mechanisms may also be involved in acanthosis nigricans, particularly in cases in which insulin resistance is absent. As an example, mutations in certain FGFRs may contribute to acanthosis nigricans through the promotion of keratinocyte proliferation and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Activating mutations in FGFR3 have been linked to several inherited syndromes that present with acanthosis nigricans, including Crouzon syndrome, severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN), thanatophoric dwarfism, and hypochondroplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/29,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,51</a>]. In addition, FGFR3 mutations were identified in a family with familial acanthosis nigricans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>], and at least two patients with malignancy-associated skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, a cytokine that may exert proliferative effects via activation of EGFR, may also contribute to the development of malignancy-associated acanthosis nigricans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. In support of this theory is a report of a patient in whom reduction of elevated serum TGF-alpha levels and amelioration of acanthosis nigricans followed the removal of a malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acanthosis-nigricans/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which other forms of acanthosis nigricans occur remain elusive.

Obesity-related, drug-induced, and malignancy-associated acanthosis nigricans often respond to this form of therapy. The role of agents that improve insulin sensitivity in patients with acanthosis nigricans related to insulin resistance remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1018712\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of underlying disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who desire accelerated improvement of acanthosis nigricans or in whom treatment of the underlying disorder is not possible or satisfactory, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical tretinoin</a> or a topical vitamin D analog, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcipotriol-calcipotriene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcipotriol</a> (calcipotriene) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Systemic retinoids may lead to clinical improvement in patients with extensive or severe disease, but relapse is common after treatment discontinuation.
