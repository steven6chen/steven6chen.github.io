With the growing availability of highly effective interferon-free regimens for HCV, a curative all-oral treatment is a possibility for the vast-majority of patients, including those with HIV coinfection. The very low incidence of adverse events and high efficacy means that almost every patient can benefit from HCV treatment. However, the cost of these new agents complicates universal delivery of antiviral therapy. Because of the more rapid progression to advanced liver disease in the setting of HIV infection, coinfection is one reason to prioritize a patient for HCV antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].

This strategy is discussed as a possible option in the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) coinfection treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, given the breadth of the antiretroviral armamentarium, there are many good choices that can be safely used with HCV DAA regimens and thus HIV therapy can generally be started first. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H870366303\"><span class=\"h2\">ART-experienced patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-coinfected</span> patients who have achieved HIV viral suppression on an ART regimen that they tolerate can continue the regimen if it does not have any expected significant drug interactions with the selected HCV treatment regimen. In contrast, a regimen switch may be indicated if components of the ART regimen cannot be used with the HCV antiviral agents. Additionally, if an ART regimen switch is indicated because of failure to suppress HIV or intolerance, potential drug interactions with HCV antivirals should be taken into account in addition to the other considerations that inform ART choice in treatment-experienced patients. (See <a href=\"#H870364631\" class=\"local\">'Potential drug interactions with ART'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In cases of ART regimen switches, the prior antiretroviral history and resistance profiles should be carefully studied to ensure that the new regimen includes two to three fully active antiretroviral agents. In general, HCV therapy is started four to six weeks after an ART regimen switch to allow for assessment of tolerability and adverse events of the new ART regimen alone. Additionally, HIV RNA is measured within four to eight weeks after the ART regimen switch to ensure that the new regimen maintains viral suppression. If the new ART regimen is to be switched back to the original ART regimen following HCV treatment, this should be delayed until at least two weeks after the completion of the HCV treatment to ensure clearance of the HCV antivirals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345778634\"><span class=\"h1\">HCV REGIMEN SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral-containing regimens among <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-coinfected</span> patients overall appears to be comparable to that among HCV-monoinfected patients, decisions on regimen selection are similar between the two groups. Regimen selection for HCV-infected patients can vary based on genotype, history of prior HCV treatment, the stage of underlying liver fibrosis, and, in rare cases, the presence of baseline NS5A resistance associated substitutions. For coinfected patients, HCV antiviral regimen selection is also constrained by the potential for drug interactions with HIV antiretrovirals, and this is the major consideration when selecting HCV antiviral regimens for such patients.

However, as they are not available in the United States, they are not discussed in this topic. Clinicians in those locations are advised to check local guidelines on the optimal use of such agents. </p><p>Treaters should note that some studied regimens are not easily prescribed because they involve combinations of drugs made by different manufacturers, and thus tend to be much more expensive than regimens made by a single company. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1469007307\"><span class=\"h2\">Regimen options by genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regimen options for <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-coinfected</span> patients with a particular HCV genotype are the same as those for HCV-monoinfected patients with that same genotype.
