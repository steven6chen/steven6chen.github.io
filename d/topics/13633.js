Some changes affect all lung transplant recipients; others may be dependent upon the type of lung transplant surgery performed (single lung transplantation (SLT), bilateral sequential or double lung transplantation (BLT), heart-lung transplantation (HLT), and living donor lobar transplantation (LDLT)), or on the pre-transplant diagnosis (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension).</p><p>The effect of lung transplantation on long-term general respiratory physiology will be presented here. Other outcome measures, such as survival and quality of life, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart-lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the process of donor lung retrieval, the vagus and sympathetic nerves, pulmonary and bronchial blood vessels, and lymphatics are interrupted. Although the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are reanastomosed to those of the recipient, the bronchial arteries that supply the airways are usually not revascularized. The recipient phrenic, vagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves are sometimes injured during the operative procedure, more commonly during heart-lung transplantation or when cardiopulmonary bypass is needed.</p><p>Postoperative respiratory function of the recipient will reflect these changes in addition to any lung injury that occurs related to the procedure. If a single lung is transplanted, postoperative function will reflect the combination of donor lung and diseased recipient lung. A discussion of the different surgical procedures is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Procedure and postoperative management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung transplantation alters many components of respiratory physiology. Some changes result from the surgical procedure, such as denervation of the transplanted lung, interrupted cough reflex, and reduced gastroesophageal motility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild airway hyperresponsiveness, particularly in response to certain bronchoprovocations, is common among lung and heart-lung transplant recipients. However, it is generally not a clinically significant problem. Nevertheless, this abnormality may be associated with an increased risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).</p><p>Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in response to exercise, isocapnic hyperventilation, and inhalation of histamine and distilled water has been studied in lung transplant recipients. Small studies have found that neither exercise nor isocapnic hyperventilation provokes a significant decrement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>); distilled water inhalation challenge stimulated only a modest response in a minority of HLT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methacholine</a> challenge tests have yielded conflicting results. Hyperresponsiveness to methacholine has been confirmed in some, but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. When present, hyperresponsiveness was attributed to denervation hypersensitivity of airway smooth muscle muscarinic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Response to methacholine does not appear to correlate with time since transplantation, post-transplantation FEV<sub>1</sub>, acute rejection, or airway inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].</p><p>Although bronchial hyperreactivity is nonspecific, early bronchial hyperresponsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> has been associated with a higher likelihood of developing BOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cough reflex and mucociliary clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two important lung defenses, the cough reflex and mucociliary clearance, are impaired following transplantation. These changes probably influence susceptibility to respiratory infection and the consequences of aspiration.</p><p>The afferent limb of the cough reflex from the transplanted lung is interrupted during organ procurement. Coughing can be stimulated from a remaining native lung or from sites in the respiratory tract proximal to the airway anastomosis. HLT recipients show a markedly decreased response to inhalation of nebulized distilled water despite the preservation of the laryngeal cough response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Reduced airway clearance may be a risk factor for sequelae of aspiration (eg, lung injury and infection) in that prolonged contact time leads to greater likelihood of lung or airway injury. This problem has been demonstrated by the presence of bile acids in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of some transplant recipients, which appeared to be a risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Mucociliary clearance appears to be modestly decreased in the transplanted lung, but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Mucociliary transport depends upon the interaction between cilia and the overlying layer of mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Both epithelial damage and ciliary dysfunction may contribute to poor clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], but mucus secretion is also influenced by neurologic control. It is possible that post-transplant alterations in the quantity or the composition of mucus change its rheologic properties and retard clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Control of breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Control of breathing is subtly altered after heart-lung and lung transplantation, but the changes are not clinically significant. The ventilatory response to hypercapnia has been variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. In one series of patients with obstructive lung disease, hypercapnia, and a blunted response to CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing before transplantation, hypercapnia and decreased ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> persisted during the first week after single lung transplantation (SLT) or bilateral lung transplantation (BLT), but resolved by three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Both normal and mildly blunted responses to hypercapnia have been reported later in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]; however, the ventilatory response to isocapnic hypoxia remains normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to lung transplantation, patients with advanced lung disease adapt their breathing patterns (frequency, tidal volume, proportion of time spent in inspiration) to compensate for their underlying lung disease. After lung transplantation, the breathing patterns during rest and exercise of transplant recipients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis are similar to those of healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], suggesting that lung disease-based adaptations in breathing pattern are reversible with lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Oropharyngeal dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and gastroparesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spectrum of oropharyngeal and gastroesophageal disorders develops following lung transplantation. The pathogenesis is likely related to injury to the vagus, recurrent laryngeal, and superior laryngeal nerves at the time of surgery, or may be a continuation of preoperative disease.</p><p>Postoperative development of swallowing difficulty was examined in a retrospective series of 263 lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Over 70 percent had laryngeal penetration or tracheal aspiration as assessed by fiberoptic endoscopic or video fluoroscopic swallowing studies. Of these, the majority had silent aspiration without any protective mechanism (eg, cough). In addition, vocal cord paresis was frequently identified (25 percent) when a formal swallowing evaluation was performed. The mechanism of oropharyngeal dysphagia is probably multifactorial, including gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), recurrent and superior laryngeal (sensory) nerve injury, and local trauma from endotracheal intubation and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram. In a follow-up study, patients with a normal swallowing evaluation had improved survival, although oropharyngeal dysphagia was not an independent risk factor for BOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Gastroesophageal dysfunction is common in patients with end-stage lung disease prior to lung transplantation. In one study of patients awaiting lung transplant, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, esophageal dysmotility, abnormal pH probe testing, and delayed gastric emptying were reported in approximately 72, 33, 38, and 44 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Pretransplant GERD may affect early outcomes after lung transplantation. Among 32 lung transplant recipients with objective evidence of GERD prior to transplantation, FEV<sub>1</sub> and survival at 18 months were decreased compared with 82 transplant recipients without GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a series of small retrospective cohort studies from a single center, reflux episodes and decreased bolus clearance detected on pre-transplant impedance monitoring were superior to pH measurement in predicting early allograft injury (acute cellular rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis) after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These parameters were also associated with early hospital readmissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The same authors suggested that pre-transplant and early post-transplant (&lt;6 month) antireflux surgery would improve outcome after lung transplantation by preventing the development of early graft injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Parameters detected on pre-transplant impedance monitoring and their impact on the development on chronic lung allograft dysfunction has not been fully explored.</p><p>The incidence of gastroesophageal dysfunction appears to be further increased following lung transplant surgery. As examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/24,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29-34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GERD has been noted in 50 to 65 percent of transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/29-31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31,34</a>]. In a cohort of 23 transplant recipients, 35 percent had GERD before transplant; this increased to 65 percent post transplant (based on 24 hour pH probe analysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. GERD was not associated with esophageal or gastric dysmotility. A lower prevalence (48 percent) of GERD was found in a study of 45 transplant recipients, although patients were tested later in their post-transplant course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of gastric emptying, delayed emptying was noted in 50 percent of pre-transplant patients, 74 percent of recipients at three months post-transplant, and 63 percent at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A significant association was noted between pre- and post-transplant gastric emptying time and subsequent BOS 0p (potential BOS), although associations with BOS 1 or higher did not achieve statistical significance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66742 \">table 1</a>). In another study, delayed gastric emptying was noted in 39 of 43 lung transplant recipients at three months post transplant and 17 of 21 at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile acids were found in BAL fluid in about half of 50 lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This finding was confirmed in another series; in addition, while pepsin was generally present in BAL from lung transplant recipients, 70 percent of the patients with BOS had bile acid in their BAL fluid compared to 31 percent of stable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, bile acid aspiration is associated with an increased rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>, progression of BOS &gt;1, and decreased survival despite the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significantly higher BAL bile acid levels, neutrophilia, and IL-8 levels were detected in 12 lung transplant recipients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, compared to 12 noncolonized controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This finding highlights a possible association between reflux, aspiration, and chronic bacterial airway colonization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonacid or weakly acidic reflux, as detected by impedance-pH testing, also appears common among lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/31,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,38</a>]. In one study of 24 lung transplant recipients, the volume of reflux and an increase in nocturnal weakly acidic reflux events, even in the face of normal total reflux events, appeared to correlate with the presence of bile acids in BAL fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>Possible mechanisms underlying this enhanced risk of oropharyngeal and gastroesophageal disorders may include immune mechanisms triggered by microaspiration and injury to the vagus nerve and esophagus during transplant surgery, especially in heart-lung transplant patients due to the anastomosis in the posterior mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory and skeletal muscle function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal and respiratory muscle dysfunction are both observed in lung transplant recipients. The etiology is likely multifactorial; the principal mechanisms include deconditioning, critical care neuropathy, glucocorticoid related myopathy, and injury to the phrenic nerve.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg muscle weakness, a consistent finding in lung transplant patients, appears to be independent of the underlying pre-transplant diagnosis and type of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/18,42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,42-46</a>]. As an example, a significant decrease in skeletal muscle strength, as measured by the quadriceps force, was found in 36 patients after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This decline correlated with the length of stay in the intensive care unit. Furthermore, in a longitudinal retrospective study the initial increase in six-minute walk distance following lung transplantation was not continued between 6 to 12 months post transplant; 58 percent of lung transplant recipients did not achieve the 82 percent predicted distance at 12 months. FEV<sub>1 </sub>and quadriceps, or grip strength at discharge were predictive of reaching this value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a randomized controlled trial, a three month rehabilitation program improved quadriceps force and other measures of physical fitness and functional capacity in uncomplicated lung transplant recipients over age 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. With rehabilitation, leg muscle strength can equal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] or exceed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] pre-transplant values. A systematic review found that quadriceps strength in published reports ranged from 49 to 86 percent predicted in pre-lung transplant patients to 51 to 72 percent in the early postoperative period and 58 to 101 percent beyond three months post transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, lung transplantation had a more profound effect on exercise tolerance in female patients and their muscle strength recovered more slowly despite intensive rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These findings suggest that deconditioning is not the only factor in the development of skeletal muscle weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report of 12 patients found that the cumulative dose of glucocorticoids was an independent predictor of quadriceps atrophy, but not diaphragm or abdominal muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In contrast, another study found both diaphragmatic and leg weakness after a brief course of high dose glucocorticoids, as given to treat acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When donor lungs are transplanted, vagal and autonomic nerves, and also pulmonary, bronchial, and lymphatic vessels are all interrupted. One of the interrupted nerves is the afferent limb of the cough reflex; coughing can be stimulated from a remaining native lung or from sites in the respiratory tract proximal to the airway anastomosis, but may be blunted in the transplanted lung. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following lung and heart-lung transplantation, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, esophageal dysmotility, and delayed gastric emptying are frequent. As a consequence of gastroesophageal dysmotility, aspiration of gastric and bile acids may occur and contribute to acute rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Oropharyngeal dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and gastroparesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragmatic strength improves after lung transplantation in most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), however diaphragmatic paralysis may occur in 3 to 30 percent of transplant recipients, more commonly those receiving HLT. Skeletal muscle strength is reduced in most transplant recipients, probably due to deconditioning and effects of immunosuppressive medications post transplant. Rehabilitation is effective at improving strength. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory and skeletal muscle function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) usually improve over first 3 months following SLT and BLT; slight further improvement occurs up to about 24 months after BLT. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of complications, lung transplant recipients experience improved functional capacity; however, a persistent exercise limitation remains regardless of the type of surgery or the underlying lung disease. In part, this is caused by skeletal muscle dysfunction from deconditioning and medications. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Exercise function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following BLT or HLT for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiac index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance usually return to normal. After SLT for PAH, mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decrease significantly, but cardiac index is less likely to improve. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Disease specific changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1870487254\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Roland G Nador, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Glanville AR, Gabb GM, Theodore J, Robin ED.
