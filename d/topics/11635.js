Stone disease is also seen with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors but typically not with proximal (type 2) RTA. Most of the studies on RTA and nephrolithiasis have been small, and there is variability in individual phenotype and the response to therapy. The following should be read with these cautions in mind.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal (type 1) RTA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors can contribute to the relationship between distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and stone formation or nephrocalcinosis. In some families, for example, hypercalciuria appears to be the primary abnormality, with calcium-induced interstitial and tubular damage possibly responsible for the RTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In most cases, however, RTA is the initial condition with subsequent acidemia promoting stone formation both by increased calcium phosphate release from bone during bone buffering of retained acid and by direct reduction in the tubular reabsorption of these ions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. The degree of hypercalciuria is roughly proportional to the severity of the acidemia.</p><p>Two other factors also contribute importantly to stone formation in this disorder: the persistently high urine pH, which favors the precipitation of calcium phosphate (but not calcium oxalate, the solubility of which is relatively insensitive to pH in the physiologic range); and reduced citrate excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], since acidemia enhances proximal citrate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Urinary citrate is normally a potent inhibitor of calcium stone formation (oxalate and phosphate), both by forming a soluble complex with calcium and by inhibiting stone growth by agglomeration of calcium crystals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Kidney histopathology of stone formers with distal RTA reveals calcium phosphate deposits plugging inner medullary collecting and Bellini ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Significant interstitial fibrosis is also observed, even in areas without plugging. Although further study is needed to verify these results, some of the radiographic calcifications in these patients may represent surgically approachable stones rather than nephrocalcinosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal (type 2) RTA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By contrast, stone formation does not appear to occur more frequently in individuals with proximal RTA in which the primary defect is a reduction in bicarbonate reabsorptive capacity in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of distal (type 1) and proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At least three factors may protect against stone formation in this disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the plasma bicarbonate concentration has fallen to the level of reabsorptive capacity (usually between 12 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> all of the filtered bicarbonate can be reabsorbed. At this time, bicarbonaturia ceases (unless exogenous bicarbonate is given) and the urine can be normally acidified. The acid urine pH increases the solubility of calcium phosphate, thereby preventing its precipitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reabsorption of all of the filtered bicarbonate means that the daily acid load can be excreted as ammonium and titratable acids, as in normal individuals. Thus, in the steady state, untreated patients with proximal RTA are in acid-base balance, although at a lower plasma bicarbonate concentration and extracellular pH than normal. As a result, there is no continued increase in calcium phosphate release from bone due to buffering of unexcreted acid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal tubular dysfunction can lead to increased excretion of organic anions (including citrate). These solutes can form soluble complexes with calcium, thereby limiting the amount of free calcium available for precipitation with phosphate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbonic anhydrase is important for both proximal and distal acidification. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, are thought to act primarily in the proximal tubule, where they inhibit bicarbonate reabsorption, producing a picture similar to proximal RTA. However, by contrast, nephrolithiasis in proximal RTA (in which the risk of calcium stones is not elevated), the risk of calcium stones is raised with acetazolamide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] and with two drugs that have carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zonisamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. The stones have primarily been composed of calcium phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>], but calcium oxalate stones can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A marked reduction in urinary citrate excretion had been documented in these patients and is a known risk factor for stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Hypocitraturia'</a>.)</p><p>Data are limited on the absolute risk of stone formation with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy. In a study of 20 patients chronically treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> for neuromuscular disease, three (15 percent) developed renal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The reported prevalence was much lower in a series of 167 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zonisamide</a> (3.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and 1800 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> (1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], both of which appear to be a weaker carbonic anhydrase inhibitor than acetazolamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and nephrolithiasis should undergo a metabolic evaluation to design the optimal regimen to prevent growth of existing stones and new stone formation. A bone density examination should also be performed because of the frequent finding of skeletal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All of the above changes in distal RTA can be reversed by complete correction of the acidemia: less calcium phosphate release from bone, lower rates of urinary calcium and phosphate excretion, a rise in urinary citrate excretion (although not necessarily to the reference range), and prevention of new stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/1-3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,19,20</a>]. The decrease in stone formation can occur even in patients with the incomplete form of distal RTA who have a persistently alkaline urine pH and hypocitraturia, but a normal or near normal extracellular pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of distal (type 1) and proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis&quot;, section on 'Incomplete distal RTA'</a>.)</p><p>Potassium citrate (citrate is rapidly metabolized to bicarbonate) or potassium bicarbonate can be used to correct the acidemia in stone formers with distal RTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>]. Potassium citrate is available in a tablet form, while potassium bicarbonate needs to be dissolved in water. The use of either potassium salt will directly treat hypokalemia.</p><p>On the other hand, the increase in sodium intake associated with sodium citrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> administration can produce an undesirable increase in urinary calcium excretion since calcium reabsorption passively follows that of sodium in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Thus, we recommend avoiding sodium alkali salts.</p><p>The potential efficacy of potassium alkali (citrate or bicarbonate) therapy can be illustrated by the following observations in studies in which stone formation rates were compared before and after therapy; randomized placebo-controlled trials have not been performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of nine patients with incomplete distal RTA and nephrolithiasis, treatment with potassium citrate (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day)</span> for almost three years was associated with complete cessation of new stone formation compared to a mean of 39 stones per patient formed in the three years prior to potassium citrate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of incomplete distal RTA and hypocitraturia associated with medullary sponge kidney, potassium citrate therapy was given to patients with stone risk factors (eg, hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia) at an initial dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> that was increased gradually until urinary citrate excretion exceeded 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or the urine pH reached 7.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There were 65 patients who were treated for one year and ten patients who did not accept or adhere to therapy. The stone event rate, defined as passage or surgical extraction or fragmentation of a stone was markedly reduced in the adherent patients (0.10 versus 0.58 stones per year per patient). The adherent patients had a substantial and significant reduction in urinary calcium excretion (378 to 178 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and a significant increase in citrate excretion (268 to 460 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Neither of these changes were seen in the nonadherent patients, while the urine volume and sodium excretion were similar in the two groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-sponge-kidney#H21853656\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary sponge kidney&quot;, section on 'Kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The inverse relationship between urinary citrate excretion and calcium-containing stone formation is continuous; thus, the higher the urine citrate concentration is, the lower the stone risk. However, the administration of potassium alkali has the potential to increase the risk of stones by raising the urine pH, thereby increasing the likelihood of calcium phosphate crystal formation. Thus, alkali therapy must be undertaken with caution. We monitor the urine pH and citrate excretion with the following goals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with complete distal RTA, the goal of potassium citrate therapy is to increase the plasma bicarbonate concentration to the low end of the reference range, which should prevent a substantial increase in urine pH. We typically discontinue citrate therapy if the urine pH rises above 7.0 without a substantial increase in urinary citrate excretion or a reduction in urinary calcium excretion. Among such patients, we balance the need to administer alkali to maintain the serum bicarbonate level with the risk associated with a higher urine pH. Thus, if the serum bicarbonate level is acceptable, then the alkali dose is reduced or even discontinued and we administer a thiazide diuretic with the goal of lowering the urine calcium level. A thiazide diuretic may also be added in patients with low bone density, given the evidence that thiazides can help maintain bone density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcium phosphate stones'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;, section on 'Thiazide diuretics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with incomplete distal RTA, the goal is to increase urinary citrate concentration without exceeding a urine pH of 7.0. A thiazide diuretic can be added to reduce urinary calcium if stone formation persists, even if the urine calcium is in the traditional &quot;normal&quot; range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A thiazide diuretic may also be added in patients with low bone density, but this does not seem to be a common finding in incomplete distal RTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
