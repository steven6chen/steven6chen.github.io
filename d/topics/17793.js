Specifically, patients with lipoatrophy have loss of subcutaneous fat, most noticeably in the limbs, face, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> buttocks areas. Patients with fat accumulation have gain of visceral fat in the abdomen and may have dorsocervical fat pad enlargement (buffalo hump) and breast enlargement.</p><p>Patients may present with lipoatrophy, fat accumulation, or a combination of the two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Since potential management differs depending on the nature of the change in fat, lipoatrophy and fat accumulation will be discussed separately after a general consideration of the rationale for treating these disorders.</p><p>The treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy will be reviewed here.

Neither stavudine nor zidovudine is a first-line NRTI for treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patients initiating ART. However, some patients who initiated treatment years ago may still be on regimens that contain these agents. Although replacing an older-generation protease inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a>) with a different third agent (eg, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], integrase inhibitor, or later-generation protease inhibitor) does not clearly improve lipoatrophy or limb fat loss, it may have other metabolic benefits. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Switching antiretrovirals'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient#H511381876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Treatment-experienced patients'</a>.) </p><p>For patients with severe facial atrophy who are willing to undergo a surgical approach to reverse the appearance, we suggest the injectable temporary fillers. This intervention is generally effective but may not be accessible for financial reasons. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with lipoatrophy who also have impaired glucose tolerance, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> can increase limb fat. However, its efficacy has not been clearly established and a number of safety concerns have been raised with the use of thiazolidinediones. (See <a href=\"#H49850451\" class=\"local\">'Thiazolidinediones'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Switching antiretrovirals</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H684114697\"><span class=\"h3\">Switching the NRTI backbone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to thymidine analogues (in particular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, but also <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>) is a major factor associated with lipoatrophy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy#H2270602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;, section on 'Exposure to NRTIs'</a>). Thus, modifying the antiretroviral regimen so that stavudine or zidovudine is replaced with a different NRTI, namely tenofovir or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, is the main medical approach to lipoatrophy. This can result in modest gains in limb fat. In fact, tenofovir and abacavir are first-line NRTIs because of their efficacy, safety, and convenience, whereas stavudine and zidovudine are associated with an excess of other side effects and inferior virologic potency. Thus, such a switch would have additional potential benefits. Nevertheless, an individual's prior antiretroviral treatment history and resistance profile must be taken into account prior to changing antiretrovirals to ensure that the new regimen would have expected efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Considerations on choosing between tenofovir and abacavir in the absence of resistance concerns are discussed elsewhere.

However, gains in fat have been modest over the short term, and patients should be advised not to expect dramatic changes in appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 111 patients with moderate to severe lipoatrophy (85 on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and 26 on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>), patients were randomly assigned to either switch their thymidine analogue therapy to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> or to continue treatment without change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At 24 weeks, patients who switched to abacavir had modest increases in limb fat compared with those who continued thymidine analogue therapy. In long-term follow-up of this trial, those switching to abacavir had a 36 percent increase in limb fat at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 105 patients with moderate to severe lipoatrophy (71 on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and 34 on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>), patients were randomly assigned to switch their thymidine analogue therapy to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> or tenofovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At 48 weeks, patients in both groups had similar, modest increases in limb fat compared with baseline.</p><p/><p>Another strategy involves switching to a protease inhibitor-containing, nucleoside-sparing regimen, although this has other drawbacks and is not generally done to address only lipoatrophy without other reasons for switching. This approach was evaluated in 62 patients with advanced HIV, but not necessarily lipoatrophy, who were switched from their initial successful antiretroviral regimen to one including <span class=\"nowrap\">lopinavir/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a></span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> versus two nucleoside analogues and efavirenz (ACTG 5125) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although limb fat significantly increased in the nucleoside analog-sparing arm at 48 weeks, this was accompanied by a significant increase in triglycerides and total cholesterol as well. Additionally, most nucleoside-sparing regimens have inferior virologic potency compared with NRTI-based regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient#H1723488332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Regimens that do not include tenofovir or abacavir'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H684114704\"><span class=\"h3\">Switching the third drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some studies have suggested that protease inhibitors used with thymidine analogues synergistically increases the risk of lipoatrophy, there does not appear to be substantial benefit to lipoatrophy by switching a protease inhibitor to a different third drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy#H95344288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;, section on 'Exposure to other ART classes'</a>.)</p><p>Switching from a protease inhibitor to an NNRTI or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> has not resulted in improvement in lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Moreover, switching from an older-generation protease inhibitor to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> does not clearly improve lipoatrophy. In a trial of 201 HIV patients with abdominal fat accumulation and viral suppression on a regimen containing a twice-daily ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, half of whom were taking thymidine analogues, there was a trend towards less limb fat loss at 48 weeks among those who were randomly assigned to switch to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (0.9 versus -3.6 percent change in patients remaining on their original regimen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This difference, however, was not statistically significant. There was no difference in abdominal adiposity between the two groups, either. However, switching to atazanavir favorably affected lipid profiles, as seen in other studies, and thus may be warranted for reasons other than effects on lipoatrophy.

In another study of 101 patients with facial lipoatrophy randomly assigned to either immediate or deferred therapy with PLLA, subjective measures of lipoatrophy severity were better in the immediate therapy group even though there were no significant differences between the two groups in facial tissue volume as measured by computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium hydroxylapatite consists of hydroxylapatite microspheres that serve as scaffolding for collagen growth, and several observational studies have supported its use for HIV-associated lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-43</a>]. In an open-label study in 100 patients with facial lipoatrophy, 100 percent met the primary efficacy endpoint of improvement on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The subjective improvement was sustained through 12 months of follow-up, and skin thickness increased significantly by a mean of 2.3 mm at 12 months.

In general, use of permanent fillers is less desirable than temporary fillers due to potential worsening or improvement in facial lipoatrophy as a result of continuing or changing ART, which may result in undesirable cosmetic effects such as sagging of skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Furthermore, infectious complications have been reported with some permanent fillers.
