The following five interconnected proteins are involved in the coupling of the cytoskeleton to the membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79183 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spectrin (the most abundant RBC cytoskeletal protein, composed of alpha-beta heterodimers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ankyrin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein 4.2 (also called band 4.2; previously called pallidin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein 4.1 (also called band 4.1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Band 3 protein (also called AE1 [anion exchange protein 1])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycophorin C</p><p/><p>Genetic variation affecting the abundance, structure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of these proteins can cause abnormalities of RBC shape and reduced deformability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Elliptocytosis is one such shape change, which can be conferred by abnormalities in spectrin, protein 4.1, or band 3. (See <a href=\"#H852150957\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> below.)</p><p>The elliptical shape of elliptocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63129\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63129 \">picture 1</a>) appears to develop during the normal aging of RBCs in the circulation (rather than during RBC production in the bone marrow) since RBC precursor cells in the HE syndromes are round and do not exhibit morphologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mechanism is thought to involve repeated episodes of deformation that occur as RBCs pass through narrow capillary beds; these episodes of deformation cause permanent changes in the cytoskeleton of affected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Unaffected RBCs undergo elastic recoil after they emerge from narrow capillaries and regain the normal biconcave disc shape, but RBCs from individuals with HE appear to lack some of the normal connections between cytoskeletal and membrane components and may form new contacts that cause the cell to retain an elliptocytic shape. In severe cases, membrane is lost, leading to more severe alterations in shape <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> membrane fragmentation, producing spherocytes or poikilocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114013 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1484587627\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal RBC morphologies'</a> below.)</p><p>The morphologic changes in HE do not necessarily shorten the lifespan of an RBC. This is illustrated by the observation of a normal lifespan of RBCs from individuals with Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO; caused by abnormalities of band 3), despite the oval shape of these cells and their increased membrane rigidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, people with SAO generally do not have hemolysis or anemia.

These include single base substitutions, insertions, deletions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes that affect mRNA processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Variants in alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin are most common, accounting for approximately 65 and 30 percent of cases, respectively (see <a href=\"#H3144600209\" class=\"local\">'Spectrin mutations'</a> below). Defects in protein 4.1 account for approximately 5 percent, and abnormalities in glycophorin C have also been reported. SAO is due to a characteristic deletion in band 3.</p><p>Most forms of HE are transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern; affected individuals are heterozygous for a disease-causing mutation. Expressivity can be variable (ie, the phenotype can be more or less severe in different individuals with the same genotype) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H3091344985\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Variable expressivity'</a>). Heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic with mild or no hemolysis, although a small percentage may have more severe disease with chronic or intermittent hemolysis. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes often have severe, symptomatic hemolytic anemia, which may be designated as hemolytic HE or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), depending on the RBC morphology. HPP is often caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting spectrin protein structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In other HPP cases, heterozygosity for a spectrin defect may occur in combination with a variant that severely reduces production of the normal spectrin protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Alpha chains are normally produced in excess of beta chains, but the proportion of alpha to beta chains in the final spectrin molecule is equivalent. Thus, the quantity of beta chains synthesized is thought to determine the total quantity of spectrin that will ultimately be assembled on the RBC membrane. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;, section on 'Spectrin'</a>.)</p><p>Mutations affecting the alpha-spectrin gene are the most common cause of HE, accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55451 \">figure 2</a>); mutations affecting beta-spectrin account for another 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha-spectrin</strong> &ndash; The majority of alpha-spectrin mutations are single nucleotide substitutions that cause changes in helix C of one of the repeating polypeptide units near the amino-terminal end of the alpha-spectrin polypeptide; these affect dimer-dimer self-association and thus interfere with tetramer formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These abnormalities can be identified because they often alter the normal 80 kD alpha-I tryptic fragment from this region upon tryptic digestion of the protein, creating smaller polypeptide fragments (typical sizes: 78, 74, 65, or 46 to 50 kD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/4,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-12</a>]. Mutations have also been described that affect the alpha-II tryptic fragment, which is adjacent to the alpha-I 80 kD fragment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,14</a>]. A more distal mutation, located between the alpha-3 and alpha-4 spectrin repeats, limits tetramer formation by stabilizing the closed dimer conformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There are also several abnormally truncated (shortened) alpha-spectrins caused by alterations in introns that lead to exon skipping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most individuals with disease-causing alpha-spectrin mutations are heterozygotes and have common HE, often with little to no hemolysis (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical syndromes'</a> below). Some individuals may have more severe hemolytic anemia or an HPP phenotype, especially when they are homozygous or compound heterozygous for a disease-causing mutation or when they are compound heterozygous for a disease-causing mutation and an alpha-spectrin variant that reduces production of normal alpha-spectrin, resulting in a high ratio of abnormal to normal alpha-spectrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/4,5,15,18,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,15,18,21-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common low-expression alpha-spectrin allele is alpha-spectrin LELY (low-expression allele Lyon), named for the city in France where it was characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The allele has two base substitutions (a single base change in exon 40 and a single base change in intron 45 that causes partial skipping of exon 46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The reduced expression appears to be due to the partial exon skipping, which confers increased vulnerability to proteolysis. It can be convenient to consider the alpha-spectrin LELY mutation to be acting in a way similar to a single gene alpha thalassemia mutation, in both cases giving rise to a condition that is clinically silent on its own but that can exacerbate other anemias (such as HE) that depend on normal levels of alpha-spectrin production. When inherited in trans with an HE disease-causing mutation, alpha-spectrin LELY causes a more severe disease phenotype because it reduces levels of the normal alpha-spectrin protein. When inherited in cis with an HE disease-causing mutation (ie, on the same allele as the disease-causing mutation), the clinical consequences of the mutation may be ameliorated because the level of the abnormal spectrin is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When inherited on its own (without an HE mutation, which occurs in 20 to 30 percent of the general population), alpha-spectrin LELY does not cause disease or abnormal RBCs. Other low-expression alleles have also been reported that reduce mRNA synthesis or increase proteolysis (eg, LEPRA [low-expression allele Prague], Bicetre, St. Louis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta-spectrin</strong> &ndash; Disease-causing beta-spectrin mutations typically cause abnormalities at the distal (carboxyl-terminal) end of the protein and affect dimer-dimer association. Several single nucleotide substitutions lead to production of full-length beta-spectrin polypeptides with altered function. These variants also lead to greater exposure of the alpha-I-74 cleavage site in alpha-spectrin and increase the ratio of the I-74 to I-80 fragments upon tryptic digestion of alpha-spectrin. Heterozygosity for these variants is clinically silent or produces a mild phenotype, but homozygosity can cause severe or even lethal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/10,12,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,31-33</a>]. Other variants that truncate (shorten) the beta-spectrin polypeptide have also been demonstrated to interfere with dimer-dimer association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. Low-abundance beta-spectrins may give rise to spectrin deficiency as well as altered dimer-dimer associations, sometimes causing spherocytic elliptocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/34,36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,38</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4197241074\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary spherocytic elliptocytosis (HSE)'</a> below).

Variants that lead to deficiency of the protein and structural abnormalities have been described. As an example, analysis of nine related French families with HE revealed a single codon deletion that causes loss of a single amino acid (lysine) residue in protein 4.1, resulting in a partial protein 4.1 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Heterozygotes tend to have elliptocytosis without hemolysis or anemia, whereas homozygotes for disease-causing variants in protein 4.1 tend to have a severe HPP phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Its functions are twofold: exchanging bicarbonate for chloride ions across the RBC membrane and linking the membrane lipid bilayer to the underlying cytoskeleton. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics#H3785284454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;, section on 'Band 3'</a>.)</p><p>A specific band 3 variant (a 27 base pair deletion) causes Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO)'</a> below). This deletion creates an in-frame removal of nine amino acids (codons 400 to 408) at the junction of the membrane-spanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail of band 3 on its cytosolic surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].

This explains the typical laboratory findings consistent with extravascular hemolysis (see <a href=\"#H283084979\" class=\"local\">'Testing for hemolysis'</a> below), as well as the benefit of splenectomy in individuals with severe chronic hemolytic anemia due to HE.

These changes have been hypothesized to occur as a consequence of the high concentrations of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in neonatal RBCs. HbF does not bind 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), and, as a result, large amounts of free 2,3-DPG are available to interact with and destabilize the RBC cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Excess 2,3-DPG does not appear to have a discernible effect on RBC shape or survival in infants without HE. However, in RBCs with a weakened cytoskeleton, 2,3-DPG is thought to be sufficient to decrease mechanical stability, producing poikilocytosis and hemolytic anemia. As HbF levels decline over the first few months of life, the contribution of 2,3-DPG to the hemolytic process wanes, hemolysis disappears, and poikilocytes are replaced by the elliptocytes that are characteristic of common HE. Transient hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anemia may also be precipitated by intercurrent illnesses or infections in older children and adults.

Causes of this variability include the specific genes affected and the specific mutation(s) within those genes, as well as whether the individual has inherited an HE mutation from one parent or both. Anemia can develop or worsen if the individual develops concomitant iron deficiency or deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate. Severe hemolysis is usually a consequence of homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for one or more disease-causing mutations or one disease-causing mutation and one low-expression &alpha;-spectrin (alpha-spectrin) allele. (See <a href=\"#H852150957\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> above.)</p><p>Variability is also seen in different family members with the same disease-causing variant, as well as in the same individual at different ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Genetic modifiers and other factors are thought to be responsible for this variability among individuals with the same HE genotype.

Some of these syndromes have specific genotype-phenotype relationships (eg, heterozygosity for spectrin or protein 4.1 mutations in common HE; homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for spectrin or protein 4.1 mutations in HPP; specific band 3 deletion in SAO), but others do not. The major clinical differences in these syndromes are in the RBC morphology and severity of hemolysis, as discussed in the following sections and summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99514\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99514 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484587627\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal RBC morphologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of common HE is the presence of elliptical (oval)-shaped red blood cells (RBCs) on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63129\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63129 \">picture 1</a>), which can range from numerous (up to 100 percent of RBCs) or less common (approximately 15 percent of RBCs).

Many individuals with common HE only come to medical attention when a high percentage of elliptocytes (typically &ge;15 percent, often as high as 90 percent) is noted on the peripheral blood smear. A few individuals, termed silent carriers, inherit a mutation that, in others, underlies common HE but for poorly understood reasons do not exhibit the RBC morphologic changes typical of HE. Nevertheless, their mutation, if inherited alone or in combination with another HE mutation, may lead to clinical HE in their children.</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of individuals with common HE have more severe hemolysis, referred to as hemolytic HE. This may be due to homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for an HE mutation, heterozygosity for an HE mutation in combination with a low-expression alpha-spectrin allele (see <a href=\"#H852150957\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> above), or another genetic or environmental modifier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPP, generally the most severe type of HE, is thus named because the RBC morphology resembles that seen in patients with thermal burns.

However, the absence of these findings does not eliminate the possibility of HE since many individuals with HE do not have hemolysis. If hemolysis is present, the severity and chronicity of hemolysis has implications for management that are discussed below.

This test is not required for the diagnosis of HE, but it may be helpful in selected cases in which there is diagnostic uncertainty such as suspected hereditary spherocytic elliptocytosis (HSE). This test may require a specialized laboratory. If osmotic fragility testing is performed, it may be normal in individuals with common HE who do not have significant hemolysis; it may show increased fragility in individuals with HPP or hemolytic HE or spherocytic HE; and it may show normal to decreased fragility in individuals with SAO. It is worth noting that individuals with HE may have other conditions that alter osmotic fragility testing. An example of this was illustrated in a case report that described falsely normalized osmotic fragility in an individual with SAO and beta thalassemia trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Of note, testing for hemolysis is often appropriate in other individuals with unexplained anemia (ie, those with other diagnoses than HE), as discussed separately.

We consider the diagnosis of an HE syndrome (HE, SAO, or HPP) to be confirmed in an individual who has ovalocytes or elliptocytes on the peripheral blood smear without another explanation. Typically, at least 15 percent of the RBCs show the abnormal morphology, although there may be exceptions (eg, a recent episode of severe hemolysis). The extent of evaluation required to exclude other causes depends on the individual and the RBC morphology. In a young healthy person with a known family history, it may not be necessary to do other testing with the possible exception of testing for iron deficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thalassemia. In other cases (eg, negative family history, RBC morphologies other than typical elliptocytes), additional testing is used.

This is because HS is routinely treated with splenectomy, whereas HSE is only treated with splenectomy if hemolysis is quite severe (see <a href=\"#H10802609\" class=\"local\">'Role of splenectomy'</a> below). Distinction between HSE and HS, as well as differentiation among other HE subtypes, may be facilitated by osmotic fragility tests, a search for elliptocytes in family members, and, in some cases, genetic testing (eg, suspected SAO).

Like HE, thalassemia is common in malaria-endemic regions of the world; the family history is often positive; and the blood smear shows abnormal RBC morphologies. Like hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), hemoglobin H disease (a severe form of alpha thalassemia) can have microcytosis, fragmented RBCs, spherocytes, and reticulocytosis. Unlike HE, the main finding in the thalassemias is hypochromic, microcytic RBCs, teardrop-shaped RBCs, target cells, and basophilic stippling in RBCs. Unlike HE, thalassemia results in an abnormal hemoglobin analysis and globin gene abnormalities on DNA testing.

Like HE, HS is characterized by mutations affecting cytoskeletal components, including spectrin and band 3, and there is often a family history of hemolytic anemia. Unlike HE, HS is characterized by abundant spherocytes without RBC fragments or severe microcytosis; elliptocytes are not present in HS. Confusion may arise when encountering a case of hereditary spherocytic elliptocytosis (HSE), a rare condition that shares features of both HS and HE. The presence of numerous elliptocytes in the blood of a patient with otherwise typical HS suggests a diagnosis of HSE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4197241074\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary spherocytic elliptocytosis (HSE)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary xerocytosis</strong> &ndash; Hereditary xerocytosis (HX; also referred to as dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis [dehydrated HSt]) is a rare inherited RBC disorder in which mutations affecting RBC membrane transport channels lead to reduced RBC water content, producing stomatocytes on the blood smear and hemolytic anemia. Like individuals with Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO), those with HX have a family history of hemolytic anemia and stomatocytic-appearing cells on the blood smear, although the appearance of stomatocytes differs from stomatocytic elliptocytes. Like SAO, some cases of HX are caused by mutations affecting band 3; however, the characteristic band 3 deletion is specific to SAO. Unlike SAO, target cells are a dominant feature of HX. Osmotic fragility is not helpful as it is decreased in both HX and SAO. Additional laboratory test results specific to HX are discussed separately.

Like those with HE, individuals with iron deficiency may have abnormal RBC morphologies and anemia. Unlike HE, iron deficiency anemia is microcytic and hypochromic without elliptocytes, and in iron deficiency the iron studies show low serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation. In some cases of suspected HE, it may be prudent to eliminate the possibility of iron deficiency before proceeding to more specialized testing.

Like HE, the RBC morphology in myelofibrosis may show oval-shaped cells, and the patient may be anemic. Unlike HE, the cells in myelofibrosis are more teardrop-shaped than elliptical, and in myelofibrosis there are often abnormalities in other cell lines such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, or thrombocythemia. Unlike HE, myelofibrosis is associated with characteristic increased reticulin fibers in the bone marrow. Unlike HE, myelofibrosis usually affects older adults.

Like HE, the RBC morphology in MDS is abnormal, but in MDS there is typically macrocytosis (large cells) rather than elliptocytosis. Unlike HE, MDS can be associated with other cytopenias besides anemia (MDS often causes thrombocytopenia and neutropenia), along with dysplastic changes in one or more cell line. Acquired elliptocytosis has been described in some patients with MDS, often in association with del(20q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H10802609\" class=\"local\">'Role of splenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Chronic hemolytic anemia may also lead to formation of pigment gallstones and symptomatic gallstone disease. We generally reserve gallbladder imaging for those with symptoms or those planning to undergo splenectomy (for whom cholecystectomy might be performed at the same time if gallstones are present).

This is consistent with our experience and with the mechanism of extravascular hemolysis involving reticuloendothelial macrophages (of which the spleen is a primary site).</p><p>When hemolysis is severe or the resulting anemia is life-threatening, splenectomy may lessen anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eliminate the need for regular RBC transfusions. We sometimes use splenectomy in this setting, with a decision process similar to that for individuals with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), as discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>). However, unlike HS, in which splenectomy is routine for individuals with chronic hemolysis, in HE the decision requires more thought. Given the paucity of definitive information and the relative rarity of HE, decisions must be individualized, and referral to a hematologist and surgeon with the appropriate experience is warranted.</p><p>As with splenectomy for other nonmalignant disorders, splenectomy is associated with surgical risks and an increased risk of infections, especially with encapsulated organisms. Thus, we usually try to delay the procedure until after the age of six years if possible, and we provide pre-splenectomy vaccinations and education regarding when to use prophylactic antibiotics and when to seek medical attention for possible infections. This subject is discussed in more detail separately.

Testing for hemolysis is appropriate if &gt;15 percent elliptocytes or other characteristic HE morphologies are present or if the patient has anemia.
