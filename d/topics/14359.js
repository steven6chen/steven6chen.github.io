Because of the propensity for scarring and inadequate sampling, nail surgery is best performed by clinicians with appropriate training and experience. Prerequisites for a successful nail biopsy include a thorough understanding of nail anatomy, adequate anesthesia and hemostasis, and proper patient selection and preparation. Nail avulsions, biopsies, and excisions can be safely performed in the office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the surgical anatomy of the nail apparatus, preoperative patient evaluation, anesthesia techniques, basic surgical procedures, and surgical treatment of specific nail lesions. </p><p>Nail disorders, nail biopsy techniques, nail plate avulsion, and chemical matricectomy are discussed separately.

Although most of the nail matrix is hidden beneath the proximal nail fold, the distal third of the nail matrix is sometimes visible through the proximal portion of the nail plate as a half-moon shaped structure called the lunula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. The proximal nail matrix forms the dorsal (superior) portion of the nail plate whereas the distal nail matrix forms the ventral (inferior) surface of the nail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85617 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]. The proximal portion of the nail matrix is responsible for the production of approximately 80 percent of the nail plate, allowing the nail plate to achieve a natural convex curvature as it grows distally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>The nail bed extends transversely between the lateral nail folds and longitudinally from the distal lunula to the hyponychium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. The nail bed possesses a rich vascular supply that results in the pink color visible through the tightly-adherent and translucent nail plate. The epithelial cells of the nail bed contribute to the undersurface of the nail plate forming a tight seal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85617 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For this reason, nail bed surgery is sometimes complicated by mild onycholysis and rarely by permanent nail dystrophy. </p><p>The dermoepithelial interface of the nail bed is composed of longitudinal rete ridges and papillary body ridges. Each papillary body ridge contains three to five longitudinally-oriented capillaries, explaining the longitudinal orientation of splinter hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. No subcutaneous tissue separates the dermis of the nail bed from the periosteum of the distal phalanx.</p><p>The proximal and lateral nail folds are collectively known as the paronychium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The nail folds serve to protect the nail plate and direct its growth in the correct orientation. The lateral nail folds of the toes are often very pronounced, making patients susceptible to the development of ingrown nails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The skin of the dorsal aspect of the proximal nail fold has a thin dermis; it lacks hair follicles and sebaceous glands, but contains some sweat glands in its most proximal part [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The ventral surface of the proximal nail fold, also called the eponychium, is thin and lacks all skin appendages. The stratum corneum of the tip and ventral surface of the proximal nail fold extends onto the nail plate as the cuticle, which protects the proximal nail plate from environmental pathogens and irritants. During nail surgery, it is important to remember that the insertion of the extensor tendon of the digit is located approximately 12 mm proximal to the cuticle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the tendon is usually proximal to the nail surgical field, it may be compromised in extensive nail surgery. </p><p>The hyponychium, located at the distal free edge of the nail plate just proximal to the distal groove, is contiguous with the volar skin and functions to seal and protect the distal nail unit from the environment. Disruption of the hyponychium may result in onycholysis and subsequent bacterial invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The paronychium plus the hyponychium and nail bed is called the perionychium.</p><p>The distal phalanx possesses a rich blood supply. Two proper digital arteries, the smaller dorsal and larger volar arteries, run alongside each digit and anastomose approximately at the level of the distal interphalangeal joint to form arcades at the levels of the proximal nail fold and the nail bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Capillaries that arise from these vessels run obliquely in the proximal nail fold and nail matrix and parallel to the surface of the longitudinally-oriented papillary ridges of the nail bed. Distal phalanx circulation is complemented by glomus bodies connected to the small muscular arterioles. At lower temperatures, glomus bodies dilate and supply warm blood to the digital capillaries.</p><p>The venous system of the digit is more variable. The blood is collected into deep and superficial systems that drain into larger veins that run subcutaneously on the dorsal and volar aspect of the digits. </p><p>Paired palmar and plantar nerves run alongside the proper digital arteries and the flexor tendon sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52608%7EPC%2F82236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52608 graphicRef82236 \">figure 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,7</a>]. The nails of the second through fourth fingers are innervated by the volar proper digital nerves, whereas the first and fifth nails and all digit tips are innervated primarily by the dorsal digital nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50552%7EPC%2F52461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50552 graphicRef52461 \">figure 4A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Just distal to the distal interphalangeal joint, the digital nerves divide into three main branches, one innervating the nail bed, one the digit tip, and the other the pulp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120459091\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4659297\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete history and targeted physical examination are necessary before nail surgery. The history should focus on potential causes of neurovascular compromise, altered hemostasis, cardiovascular disease, and the use of drugs that could interfere with anesthesia or coagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85839 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Patients should also be questioned about history of allergy to latex, antibiotics, and topical anesthetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>, or parabens (a preservative commonly found in anesthetics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Physical examination should include palpation of peripheral pulses, evaluation of fingernails and toenails, and inspection of skin, mucous membranes, hair, and scalp, looking for signs of neurovascular compromise or evidence of associated conditions (eg, systemic sclerosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130502806\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When infection is suspected, appropriate mycology, bacteriology, or virology studies should be performed.

The needle may be bent at 120&deg;, reinserted at the initial injection site, and pushed distally to the end of the lateral nail fold. The anesthetic is injected in a retrograde fashion, while pulling the needle back. For complex nail procedures, the ventral nerve branches should also be anesthetized by inserting the needle at the initial puncture site on each side and injecting 0.5 mL of anesthetic into the digit pulp.

(See <a href=\"#H120459158\" class=\"local\">'Squamous cell carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Before en bloc excision, the planned excision margins should be marked. Proximal margins generally include a line drawn transversely at about 50 to 75 percent of the distance between the distal interphalangeal joint crease and the cuticle to ensure that the nail matrix is fully excised (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85736\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85736 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This line should form a 90&#8304; angle with the lateral nail folds bilaterally. Lines should also be drawn along each of the lateral nail folds and meet at least 2 mm distal to the hyponychium on the distal digital tip. These margins may be widened on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>Although surgical techniques vary, one approach is to start the incision at a lateral edge just dorsal to the distal transverse line to simplify access to the correct plane of dissection, which is at the level of the periosteum, and proceed dorsally to reach the dorsal surface of the phalanx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

A split-thickness skin graft offers reliable graft survival but less-than-ideal color and texture match and less protection of the distal phalanx than full-thickness skin graft.

Many nail surgeons apply the initial dressing themselves to determine the appropriate level of pressure needed to maintain hemostasis without causing a tourniquet effect. A layer of antibiotic ointment is usually applied to the surgical site before dressing. Patients should be instructed to loosen the original bandage if pain due to pressure worsens, since postoperative edema may cause the original bandage to tighten, thereby functioning as a tourniquet.

Dried blood may cause adherence of the bandage to the surgical site. Soaking the dressing in warm tap water before its removal can minimize discomfort. The wound should be cleaned with half-strength hydrogen peroxide (3% over-the-counter hydrogen peroxide diluted with an equal amount of tap water) before reapplying antibiotic ointment and a clean padded dressing. On average, fingernail regrowth takes approximately 6 months and toenail regrowth about 12 months and up to 18 months for the great toenail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Postoperative analgesics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>, or NSAIDs may be necessary for adequate pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Closing the matrix defect with fine absorbable suture may prevent the split nail complication. A nail split may also occur as a consequence of pterygium (adherence between the proximal nail fold and the nail matrix after nail plate removal). Pterygium may be prevented by separating the proximal nail fold from the nail bed with nonadherent gauze, a stent, or the original nail plate. A split nail can be repaired by excision of the matrix scar followed by careful repair or, for wide matrix scars, by free matrix graft, using the big toe as donor site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>Nail plate misalignment is typically associated with the lateral longitudinal nail biopsy technique, particularly when the biopsy is &gt;3 mm in width [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/58,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,60</a>]. Nail misalignment can be treated by surgical realignment of the matrix or total matricectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/58,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques#H2729113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail biopsy: Indications and techniques&quot;, section on 'Lateral longitudinal excision'</a>.)</p><p>Partial or total chemical matricectomy may be associated with nail spicule recurrence due to incomplete destruction of the lateral or subproximal matrix. Chemical ablation is associated with the risk of tissue necrosis, pain, persistent exudative drainage, and periostitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Surgical matricectomy is thus preferred by some surgeons because of the lower risk for nail spicule formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail avulsion and chemical matricectomy&quot;, section on 'Chemical matricectomy'</a>.)</p><p>A distal nail fold may form when an overlying nail plate is lacking for an extended period of time, as in the case of a great toenail avulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although a distal nail fold is usually pushed down by the regrowing nail plate, when present for a long period of time it may become fibrotic, fixed, and interfere with further outward nail plate growth. Under these circumstances, compression of the distal nail fold by taping or removal of the distal nail fold by crescentic wedge excision may be necessary.</p><p>A pyogenic granuloma may develop following nail surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85753\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85753 \">picture 21</a>). It may be removed by cautery, scalpel excision, laser, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Other nail surgical complications include anesthetic allergy, bleeding, infection (including superficial infection, acute purulent tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis), hematoma formation, persistent pain and swelling, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy due to traumatic nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery/abstract/58,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15764861\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail surgery is performed for diagnosing clinically ambiguous lesions and dystrophies, removing benign and malignant nail tumors, and alleviating pain secondary to ingrown and traumatized nails.
