In the United States and England, the incidence of DLBCL is approximately 7 cases per 100,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. In Europe as a whole, the incidence is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Incidence varies by ethnicity, with Caucasian Americans having higher rates than Blacks, Asians, and American Indian or Alaska Natives, in order of decreasing incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7</a>]. By comparison, the incidence in Denmark is approximately 3 cases per 100,000 adults per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. DLBCL appears to be a more frequent subtype of NHL in Central and South America, where it accounts for approximately 40 percent of NHLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Like most other NHLs, there is a male predominance with approximately 55 percent of cases occurring in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Incidence increases with age; the median age at presentation is 64 years for patients as a whole, but appears to be younger for Blacks than for Caucasian Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Familial aggregation of patients with DLBCL and other NHL subtypes has been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. As an example, a large population-based observational study of patients from Sweden and Denmark reported that relatives of probands with aggressive NHL had an approximately 3.5-fold increased risk of developing NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DLBCL arises from a mature B cell, and is usually comprised of cells resembling centroblasts or immunoblasts, two distinct types of activated B cells. The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is complex and includes both genetic lesions that are relatively specific for this disease (ie, rearrangements of <em>BCL6</em>) and molecular alterations that are shared with other NHL variants. The pathogenesis of DLBCL is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to occurring de novo, DLBCL can arise through the transformation of many different types of low grade B cell lymphomas, including B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (eg, Richter's transformation), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone (MALT) lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DLBCL is an AIDS-defining malignancy. The pathogenesis of NHL in the setting of HIV infection is poorly understood, but chronic B cell stimulation and T cell immunodeficiency leading to loss of control of transforming viruses, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are thought to play important roles. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of systemic lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DLBCL typically present with a rapidly enlarging symptomatic mass, most usually nodal enlargement in the neck or abdomen, or, in the case of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, the mediastinum, but may present as a mass lesion anywhere in the body. Extranodal involvement is common among those presenting with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Systemic &quot;B&quot; symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats) are observed in approximately 30 percent of patients, and the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated in over one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A more detailed discussion of systemic complaints seen in patients with NHL is presented separately, along with the specific definitions of B symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Systemic complaints (B symptoms)'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 60 percent of patients will present with advanced stage DLBCL (usually stage III or IV disease) while 40 percent have more localized disease, usually defined as that which can be contained within one irradiation field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The bone marrow is involved in up to 30 percent of cases, but may be of a discordant histologic type, such as follicular lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], in as many as half of those cases. The staging of DLBCL is discussed in more detail separately.

DLBCL also can be locally highly invasive, leading to compression of vessels (eg, superior vena cava syndrome) or airways (eg, tracheo-bronchial compression), involvement of peripheral nerves, and destruction of bone (eg, cord compression), requiring urgent attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DLBCL is an AIDS-defining malignancy. When compared with lymphoma in the HIV-negative population, systemic lymphoma in the HIV-positive population is characterized by more frequent B symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, night sweats), extranodal disease, involvement of unusual locations (eg, body cavity, rectum, soft tissue), and advanced stage at diagnosis. This is discussed in more detail separately.

The tumor cells are of large size (eg, nuclei at least twice the size of a small lymphocyte and larger than the nucleus of a tissue macrophage) and often resemble normal centroblasts or immunoblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67243\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67243 \">picture 3</a>). Centroblasts are large, noncleaved cells with round or oval nuclei, vesicular chromatin, often multiple peripheral nucleoli and a narrow rim of basophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82926\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82926 \">picture 4</a>). Immunoblasts are larger cells with very prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm, often with plasmacytoid features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82925 \">picture 5</a>). Some tumors contain mixtures of centroblastic and immunoblastic forms.</p><p>In addition to the common centroblastic and immunoblastic morphologies, several other cytologic variants are recognized (eg, multilobated and anaplastic), but their clinical significance is debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, there is poor intra- and inter-observer reproducibility among hematopathologists attempting to subtype DLBCL based on the appearance of the tumor cells, and as a result the morphologic subtypes of DLBCL are lumped together in a single diagnostic category in the current World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, plasmablastic lymphoma is a morphologic variant that displays immunophenotypic characteristics that allow for its distinction from other DLBCLs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1386908\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasmablastic lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor cells of plasmablastic lymphoma typically have large, eccentrically placed nuclei, often with prominent single nucleoli, and abundant basophilic cytoplasm, which together constitute a &quot;plasmablast-like&quot; appearance. Unlike the other morphologic variants described above, plasmablastic tumors are immunophenotypically distinct. Specifically, these tumors are comprised of late B cells that express plasma cell markers (eg, CD138) instead of the pan-B cell markers found in typical DLBCL (eg, CD20 and CD79a). Some tumors belonging to this group have distinctive genetic or clinicopathologic features. For example, oropharyngeal plasmablastic lymphomas occur most frequently in HIV-positive individuals and are often positive for Epstein-Barr virus. Another rare genetic subtype of plasmablastic lymphoma has rearrangements of the ALK tyrosine kinase gene, discussed in more detail below. Because of the plasmacellular differentiation of these tumors, they can be easily mistaken for anaplastic myeloma when they involve the bone marrow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other mutations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunophenotype of DLBCL can be confirmed by histochemistry or flow cytometry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77348\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77348 \">figure 1</a>). Tumor cells in DLBCL generally express pan B cell antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a), as well as CD45 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74703\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74703 \">picture 6</a>). Fifty to 75 percent of tumors express surface or cytoplasmic monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig), most often of the IgM isotype. The immunoglobulin variable region genes have undergone rearrangement and are commonly somatically mutated; clonally related subpopulations may express alternative isotypes (isotype switch variants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Approximately 70 percent express B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) protein; this expression is independent of BCL-6 gene rearrangement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53759\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53759 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].
