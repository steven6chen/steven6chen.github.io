As an example, a one-year prospective observational study assigned female patients (n = 90) to one of four treatment conditions: hospitalization (multimodal specialized care program including various psychotherapies) for several months followed by outpatient treatment, an outpatient program based upon individual and family psychotherapy, an outpatient group psychotherapy program, or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The three active treatment conditions included nutritional rehabilitation (including nutritional counseling). Mean weight gain at one year was greater in patients who received active treatment than patients who received no treatment (9 to 10 kg versus 3 kg).</p><p>However, successful nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration in anorexia nervosa is often followed by relapse. One review found that in the first year after inpatient nutritional rehabilitation, relapse occurred in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Based upon retrospective studies of patients with anorexia nervosa who are treated with nutritional rehabilitation, relapse and rehospitalization may be less likely to occur in patients who are closer to their ideal body weight at the time of discharge, compared with patients with lower weights at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of inpatients (n = 59) found that the risk of postdischarge relapse was four times greater among patients with a body mass index &le;19 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> at the time of discharge, compared with a body mass index &gt;19 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study consisted of inpatients who initially gained comparable amounts of weight, and were discharged either fully weight recovered (n = 14; mean weight 96 percent of ideal body weight) or with lower discharge weights (n = 8, mean weight 76 percent of ideal body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Normalization of eating aims to interrupt problematic behaviors, such as purging and other actions that are used to compensate for eating, and can help patients regain the ability to perceive hunger and satiety.</p><p>Nutritional replenishment often reverses the general medical complications that can occur in anorexia nervosa due to starvation and malnutrition. As an example, weight restoration can ameliorate electrolyte, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and endocrine disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>].

Although osteoporosis is less amenable to acute nutritional rehabilitation, achieving a normal weight and the resumption of menses can improve osteoporosis, especially in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For patients who do not achieve expected weight gain, we suggest prescribing more calories <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreasing physical activity. In addition, patients will likely require monitoring during and after meals for a range of behaviors that undermine weight restoration (eg, vomiting, exercising, and hiding food that is not consumed).

The discussion includes information about caloric needs, the plan to initiate weight gain by increasing caloric intake from the patient&rsquo;s baseline, and the likely need to continually increase caloric intake as weight gain progresses. </p><p>Clinicians should explain to patients and families that treatment is intended to keep the patient alive. If treatment is experienced as punitive or a struggle over control, clinicians can explain that behavioral treatment aims to reinforce only those behaviors that promote health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].

The inpatient hospitalization represented the first lifetime admission to a hospital for anorexia nervosa; continued inpatient hospitalization and day hospital care each provided the same multimodal specialized care program of nutritional rehabilitation (including nutritional counseling), cognitive-behavioral therapy, and family therapy.

Enteral feeding is preferable to parenteral feeding (see <a href=\"#H2511710386\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral'</a> below) because enteral feeding normalizes gastrointestinal function (comparable to oral intake) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>].

A review of nine observational studies and one randomized trial (total n = 899 patients) found that supplementing oral meals with nasogastric tube feeding posed no additional risks; however, most studies used prophylactic supplemental phosphate to prevent refeeding hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, weight gain may perhaps be faster with nasogastric plus oral refeeding than oral refeeding alone.

All patients received psychotherapy and dietary counseling in the context of behavioral management.

In addition, a BMI &ge;18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> was achieved by more patients treated with tube feeding than the control group (39 versus 8 percent). During the one year follow-up after discharge, time to relapse was longer in the group that received tube feedings, compared with the controls (34 versus 27 weeks). However, patients may have an aversion to the tube (which can cause nasal irritation and epistaxis) and complaints of gastric fullness with enteral feeding; also, one goal of nutritional rehabilitation is to restore normal eating behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Based upon clinical experience, enteral feeding is better tolerated (with less gastric discomfort and diarrhea) and poses less danger of metabolic abnormalities when it is administered continuously over 24 hours, rather than in three to or four daily boluses, each of which requires approximately 10 minutes to administer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. However, continuous enteral feeding requires patients to be connected to the pump all day.

Edema (including abdominal edema) may be more likely to occur in patients who purged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> used laxatives. </p><p>In the absence of the full-blown refeeding syndrome, refeeding edema probably results from the increased release of insulin that is associated with increased caloric intake. Increased insulin causes sodium retention through increased reabsorption of sodium in the renal distal tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/23,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,44</a>].

Clinicians should explain that the high rate of weight gain is unlikely to continue as fluid gets reabsorbed and the general medical status stabilizes, and that nutritional rehabilitation must continue for edema to stabilize and resolve.</p><p>Refeeding edema is usually managed conservatively with bed rest, leg elevation, and monitoring fluid intake. Low-sodium diets may also be helpful. In a retrospective study that included patients managed with low sodium diets (n = 176; 4 to 5 grams <span class=\"nowrap\">NaCl/day</span> per 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day)</span> or normal sodium diets (n = 42; 10 to 12 grams <span class=\"nowrap\">NaCl/day),</span> peripheral edema occurred in fewer patients who received low-sodium diets (6 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Patients with anorexia nervosa are at high risk for orthostatic hypotension. In addition, patients are usually bradycardic, and a sudden, sustained, increased pulse greater than 70 beats per minute may be a sign of cardiac overload and harbinger of the refeeding syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: The refeeding syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight</strong> &ndash; For inpatients and partial hospital patients, weight is measured several (eg, three) times per week or on a daily basis, and for outpatients at each visit. Weighing is preferably conducted at the same time each day with the same scale, typically in the morning, post voiding, with patients in hospital gowns (when appropriate). These procedures can increase the reliability and validity of recorded weights by preventing patients from falsely elevating their weight through water loading, wearing heavy clothing, or surreptitiously carrying extra weights in pockets. Weight gain targets are discussed separately.

Early in the refeeding process (eg, first two weeks), clinicians should examine inpatients and partial hospital patients daily and outpatients at each visit, looking for signs of the refeeding syndrome. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> &ndash; Once nutritional replenishment commences, clinicians should regularly check serum electrolytes, glucose, phosphorous, magnesium, and liver function tests. The frequency of laboratory testing depends upon the severity of the patient&rsquo;s general medical status. We usually perform tests on hospital days 1, 3, 7, and 10, and weekly thereafter. For patients whose general medical status is severely compromised, laboratory tests are performed daily or every other day for at least one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hypophosphatemia can signal the need to slow down the refeeding process; hypophosphatemia is the hallmark of the refeeding syndrome, and most commonly appears on day 3 or 4 of refeeding. Hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and elevated liver enzymes can also occur. Hyponatremia may necessitate fluid restriction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The frequency of laboratory tests can be decreased progressively as patients consistently gain weight, provided serum electrolyte levels remain stable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is worth noting that hypokalemia can occur in patients who persistently vomit. If clinicians suspect that patients are fluid loading to artificially increase their weight, a urine specific gravity should be checked.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1552390\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE DIETARY REGIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anorexia nervosa who have restored their weight have higher daily caloric requirements than healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].
