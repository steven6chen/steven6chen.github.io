In general, they recommend upper endoscopy if the results are likely to influence management of the patient, if empiric treatment for a suspected benign disorder has been unsuccessful, if the procedure can be used as an alternative to radiographic evaluation, or if a therapeutic maneuver may be needed. In addition, upper endoscopy is indicated if the results would affect the management of other diseases (eg, a patient with a history of upper GI bleeding who requires anticoagulation or treatment with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug). The ASGE issued a second <a href=\"http://www.asge.org/uploadedFiles/Publications_(public)/Practice_guidelines/Endoscopy_in_the_managment_of_GERD.pdf&amp;token=DIqkudZtTnIuasKDAXStIhjHU+cc0vnCT+Wntkdv+iXmGZb5U7sgpThxzknV5G7N3h7guSkTCSxZUmCpErI7T1kXKM6x+AIW6dUxakgcrxgvCBN57TYlMsDnauJeE7LkvFRtRvlVtfujAy0yDdq7vg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13928\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guideline</a> in 2015 specifically addressing the role of upper endoscopy for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In patients with GERD, upper endoscopy was recommended to evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of complicated GERD or alarm symptoms, for follow-up of patients with severe esophagitis to rule out underlying Barrett's esophagus, and to screen for Barrett's esophagus in patients with multiple risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H671602654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The ASGE guidelines note that upper endoscopy is generally not indicated when the results will not affect management or for periodic surveillance of healed benign lesions, unless surveillance of a premalignant condition is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67012372\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic examinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many upper endoscopies are carried out for the evaluation of symptoms or to investigate abnormal findings on GI tract radiology. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper gastrointestinal symptoms &ndash; Upper endoscopy is indicated for the evaluation of patients with upper abdominal symptoms (eg, pain, nausea) that persist despite an adequate trial of therapy, whose symptoms are associated with other signs or symptoms that suggest serious organic disease such as weight loss, or who are over the age of 50 years. Upper endoscopy is also indicated for the evaluation of dysphagia, odynophagia, esophageal reflux that is persistent or recurrent despite adequate therapy, persistent vomiting of an unknown cause, or diarrhea thought to be due to small bowel disease.

This recommendation is based upon the assumptions that Barrett's esophagus adversely influences survival and that surveillance can reduce mortality. However, a survival benefit in patients undergoing surveillance has not been demonstrated in randomized prospective trials.

However, some form of screening has been proposed in several subgroups of patients in whom the risk of gastric cancer is particularly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These include older adult patients with atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia, those who have undergone partial gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], those with a sporadic gastric adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], immigrant ethnic populations from countries with high rates of gastric cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60151 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-15</a>], and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (particularly if gastric cancer has occurred in the kindred) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Other contraindications include the inability of the patient to cooperate with the procedure despite adequate attempts at <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia,</span> an inability to obtain informed consent, or the presence of a known or suspected perforated viscus (unless the examination is being done to treat the perforation). Failure to comply with dietary restrictions prior to endoscopy is a relative contraindication. (See <a href=\"#H67012131\" class=\"local\">'Diet'</a> below.) </p><p>One question that often comes up is when is it safe to perform an upper endoscopy in a patient who has had a recent myocardial infarction (MI). In a patient who needs an <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergent</span> endoscopy (eg, overt upper GI bleeding), endoscopy should not be delayed in a hemodynamically stable patient with a recent MI. A decision analysis suggests that this approach is preferable to proceeding with cardiac catheterization in patients with overt (but not occult) GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>With regard to elective procedures, there are no firm recommendations. The American Heart Association recommends waiting 60 days for noncardiac surgery following an MI if the patient has not undergone coronary revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The recommendation is to wait 14 days after balloon angioplasty and 30 days after bare metal stent implantation. If a drug-eluting stent is inserted, elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed 365 days, if possible (180 days if the risk of delay is greater than the risk of ischemia and stent thrombosis). One factor that complicates endoscopy in this setting is that patients are likely to be taking antiplatelet agents. The management of these agents around the time of endoscopy is discussed in elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiplatelet-agents-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H350963316\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiac surgery after percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p>Whether the procedure is emergent or elective, decisions regarding the timing of endoscopy and the management of antiplatelet agents in such patients should involve both the gastroenterologist(s) and cardiologist(s) caring for the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67012257\"><span class=\"h2\">Important considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the procedure, patients should be evaluated for other factors that may affect the ability to safely and successfully perform an upper endoscopy, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic considerations such as a small mouth or a limited range of motion in the jaw (factors that may make it difficult to insert the protective mouth piece), a limited range of motion of the neck that may make correct patient positioning difficult, or the presence of a Zenker's diverticulum, which increases the risk of esophageal perforation during esophageal intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid illnesses that may increase the risks associated with sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of medications such as benzodiazepines or narcotics that may increase a patient's tolerance to the effects of sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213982080\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67012131\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to elective upper endoscopy, patients typically take no food by mouth for four to eight hours, and sometimes longer if there is known or suspected delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Alternatively, clear liquids can be taken up to two hours before endoscopy (American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75116545\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most medications can be continued up to the time of endoscopy and are usually taken with a small sip of water.

Others omit this step since it may not improve patient tolerance of the procedure and since it is associated with methemoglobinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Finally, some endoscopists apply a small amount of benzocaine gel for topical pharyngeal anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H61432890\" class=\"local\">'Methemoglobinemia'</a> below.)</p><p>For upper GI endoscopy, patients are typically placed on their left side with their neck flexed forward. A simulation of the maneuver that will be necessary to pass the endoscope from the mouth to the upper esophageal sphincter is recommended to assure proper orientation of all equipment. The upper endoscope is introduced into the mouth under direct visualization, allowing for limited visualization of the tongue, other structures in the mouth, and ultimately the hypopharynx. The endoscopist can often view the epiglottis, the vocal cords, both piriform sinuses, and the arytenoid cartilages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82592\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82592 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>On the monitor, the cricopharyngeus muscle and esophageal orifice appear below the opening to the trachea, seemingly between the piriform sinuses. The endoscope is passed posteriorly toward the upper esophageal sphincter, which is at the level of the thyroid cartilage, 15 to 18 cm from the incisors. The upper esophageal sphincter is passed under direct visualization, often with the assistance of air insufflation and slight application of pressure. </p><p>Esophageal intubation should be done slowly and gently, in part to avoid intubation of a Zenker's diverticulum since doing so can lead to a perforation. A Zenker's diverticulum is an outpouching of the posterior oropharynx just proximal to the upper esophageal sphincter caused by decreased compliance of the upper esophageal sphincter. Care must also be taken in patients with known or suspected proximal esophageal strictures, which can make esophageal intubation difficult and can increase the risk of perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zenkers-diverticulum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zenker's diverticulum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213982094\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophagus and esophagogastric junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following intubation of the esophagus, the tubular esophagus is examined. The esophagus is typically approximately 25 cm in length. The examination should be carried out slowly and with adequate air insufflation to ensure complete visualization. Elements to note include the color of the mucosa and evidence of erythema, erosions, ulcers, strictures, rings, webs, varices, or diverticula.</p><p>The esophagogastric junction is generally approximately 40 cm from the incisors. There are both anatomic and histologic markers that separate the esophagus from the stomach. However, landmarks differentiating the esophagus from the stomach may be difficult to identify due to movement of the esophagus and stomach during the examination. The top of the gastric folds is the landmark generally believed to represent the esophagogastric junction. In patients without Barrett's esophagus, this is also the area of the squamocolumnar junction. The squamocolumnar junction is the area where the squamous epithelial lining of the esophagus meets the columnar lining of the stomach. Because this transition from squamous to columnar epithelium is typically uneven around the circumference of the lumen, it is also referred to as the Z-line. The transition from squamous to columnar epithelium results in a color change. The columnar mucosa of the stomach is salmon-colored, whereas the squamous mucosa is pale pink (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83182 \">picture 2</a>). In patients without a hiatus hernia, the esophagogastric junction also corresponds with the lower esophageal sphincter, though the lower esophageal sphincter cannot be seen endoscopically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiatus-hernia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hiatus hernia&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and physiology of the gastroesophageal junction'</a>.)</p><p>Hiatus hernias are frequently identified during upper endoscopy. A hiatus hernia is a condition where some portion of the stomach has herniated through the esophageal hiatus in the crural diaphragm. In this situation, the columnar-lined mucosa and top of the gastric folds will be seen proximal to the extrinsic narrowing of the lumen caused by the diaphragmatic pinch. Hiatus hernias may be seen during retroflexed exanimation of the stomach as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiatus-hernia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hiatus hernia&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213982101\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stomach is entered after passing the region of the esophagogastric junction. Initial visualization is usually of the relatively large folds of the greater curvature of the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55359\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55359 \">picture 3</a>). The examination usually proceeds along the greater curvature of the stomach towards the pylorus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68173 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Certain techniques improve examination of the stomach. First, it is important to avoid full insufflation of the stomach initially, as it may induce retching or belching. Second, suctioning the pool of fluid that is often seen in the fundus upon entering the stomach improves visualization of the area. This also minimizes the risk of reflux of gastric fluid and possible aspiration. A plastic trap can be placed in line with the suction tubing to collect this fluid for pH analysis if needed. However, care should be taken to avoid applying suction to the mucosa, as doing so may create suction artifacts that appear as abnormal mucosa. In addition, since any contact between the endoscope and the mucosa can result in trauma, it is best to examine the mucosa throughout the upper GI tract while avoiding contact with the mucosa. </p><p>While all areas of the stomach should be carefully examined, particular attention should be paid to the area of the angularis along the lesser curvature, as it is often the site of pathology.</p><p>Adequate visualization of the proximal stomach and esophagogastric junction is achieved through retroflexion. Retroflexion allows the endoscopist to see areas that are not well visualized during the initial direct examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68753\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68753 \">figure 2</a>). The technique involves the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distending the stomach with air</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advancing the endoscope to the region of the angularis in the lesser curvature in the antrum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turning the endoscope up-down dial to the maximal up position to achieve a 140 to 160 degree bend at the tip of the endoscope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many recommend locking the wheels of the endoscope to increase stiffness of the tip of the endoscope </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawing the endoscope in order to pull the tip of the endoscope toward the esophagogastric junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69189\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69189 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotating the endoscope to obtain a 360 degree view of the upper stomach</p><p/><p>Hiatus hernias are particularly easy to see when the endoscope is in the retroflexed position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83183\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83183 \">picture 5</a>). It is important to note that items placed through the endoscope's accessory channel, such as a biopsy forceps, may be difficult to use when the endoscope is in the retroflexed position. In addition, care is required to ensure that the retroflexed endoscope does not become entrapped within a hiatus hernia or in the esophagus. This is normally done by making sure that the retroflexed scope is not pulled into the hernia or the esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213982108\"><span class=\"h2\">Pyloric intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Next, the pylorus traversed under direct visualization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82398\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82398 \">picture 6</a>). Opening the pylorus for passage of the endoscope sometimes requires air insufflation, and patience may be required in patients who have particularly active or motile pyloric regions. Some patients have &quot;J-shaped&quot; stomachs, and this may increase the difficulty of intubating the pylorus due to the extreme angulation of the endoscope that may be required. Attempts to traverse the pylorus in such patients may sometimes result in significant looping in which the shaft of the endoscope presses on the greater curvature of the stomach. The pressure applied to the gastric wall by the loop can result in patient discomfort. Removing air from the stomach may help with passage in such cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213982115\"><span class=\"h2\">Duodenum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After passing through the pylorus, the endoscope enters the duodenal bulb. The endoscope is then advanced through the duodenal sweep and into the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal bulb is often devoid of characteristic features, though there may be raised bumps and polypoid areas representing either prominent Brunner's glands or heterotopic foci of gastric mucosa. The duodenum distal to the bulb has distinctive circular rings called valvulae conniventes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61994\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61994 \">picture 7</a>). </p><p>The ampulla of Vater is found in the second portion of the duodenum and is the site where the common bile duct and pancreatic duct empty into the duodenum. While the ampulla may be seen with a standard forward-viewing endoscope, a more complete examination of the ampulla requires the use of a side-viewing duodenoscope (the same endoscope used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). This is not done routinely as part of an upper endoscopy and requires specialized skills and equipment. However, it may be required for some patients such as those with familial adenomatous polyposis who are undergoing screening for ampullary adenomas. If examination of the ampulla is required, the examination should be performed with an endoscopist who is trained in the use of a side-viewing duodenoscope. In addition, the need for ampullary visualization should be communicated to the endoscopist prior to the procedure to ensure that the appropriate equipment is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67011595\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC MANEUVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers can be carried out during upper endoscopy.

sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue sampling is an important part of many upper endoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. This is highlighted by the fact that training guidelines emphasize the requirement that anyone performing diagnostic upper endoscopy masters standard techniques of tissue sampling, which include biopsies, brushings of the mucosal surface, and polypectomy. Specimens obtained during procedures can be sent for histologic, cytologic, or microbiologic analysis, depending on the type of sample and clinical scenario.</p><p>While making the visual assessment and deciding what sampling to perform, endoscopists should always keep in mind the clinical questions which prompted the procedure in the first place.</p><p>When submitting samples, it is helpful to provide the pathologist, cytologist, or microbiologist with details such as the clinical history, specimen-specific location and appearance, and the question to be answered. Including the endoscopy report and photographs of the area in question can also be very helpful. </p><p>The techniques of tissue sampling are usually straightforward:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy: A biopsy forceps is placed though the accessory channel of the endoscope, advanced to the target area, and the forceps is opened and closed to obtain a pinch biopsy. Many forceps have a &quot;spike&quot; that allows for the acquisition of more than one sample at a time. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The tubular esophagus may be difficult to biopsy because the forceps comes out of the accessory channel parallel to the wall of the esophagus. This problem can be solved by the &quot;turn-in&quot; technique, where the tip of the endoscope is turned to be more perpendicular to the wall of the esophagus (or anywhere in the upper gastrointestinal tract where this is an issue), allowing for a more direct angle in which to obtain a biopsy. This technique may be augmented by suctioning of the mucosa into the biopsy forceps before tissue acquisition, allowing for a larger sample to be obtained with each &quot;bite&quot; of the biopsy forceps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typically, biopsy forceps can only sample mucosal lesions. If a submucosal lesion is encountered, it may be possible to perform stacked or tunneled biopsies in which the same location is biopsied multiple times with the hope of obtaining deeper samples. This frequently is unsuccessful and increases the risk of perforation (especially in the esophagus), so it should be done with extreme caution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When urgent diagnosis of suspected cancer is needed in a hospital setting, endoscopic forceps biopsies can be processed by frozen section or by smashing small specimens for immediate cytology preparation. This may save time and avoid repeat procedures if delayed processed biopsies are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brushings: A brush within a sheath is placed though the accessory channel of the endoscope and advanced to the target area. The brush head is advanced out of the sheath, and the endoscopist gently brushes the area of interest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polypectomy: Polypectomy is carried out in a manner similar to that used during colonoscopy. Small polyps may be removed using a biopsy forceps. Larger polyps can be removed using snares that are passed down the accessory channel of the endoscope. Lesions larger than approximately 2 cm may require removal using specialized techniques.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessively motility in the stomach or small bowel may make careful examination difficult. While patience may be all that is necessary to allow the bowel to &quot;quiet&quot; and allow the entire examination to be completed, the use of medications to slow the bowel, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> (0.5 mg intravenously [IV]), is an option. This may be particularly helpful when therapeutic maneuvers are being carried out (eg, argon plasma coagulation of an angiodysplasia).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bubbles and excessive mucus may obscure the view of portions of the upper GI tract during endoscopy; adequate washing using an irrigating syringe or irrigating device is often sufficient. Agents that lower the surface tension of bubbles (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simethicone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simethicone</a>) and mucolytic agents (eg, N-acetylcysteine) may be useful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual material in the stomach needs to be cleared for adequate visualization; again, copious irrigation is often sufficient. Prokinetic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> (10 mg IV) given 30 to 90 minutes prior to endoscopy may facilitate passage of retained debris or blood. Residual gastric contents not only impede complete visualization, but also increase the risk of the complication of aspiration. Specialized suction devices are also available to help clear the stomach.
