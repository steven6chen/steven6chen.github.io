When a blood vessel wall is disrupted, the hemostatic response must be quick, localized, and carefully regulated. Abnormal bleeding or thrombosis (ie, nonphysiologic blood clotting not required for hemostatic regulation) may occur when specific elements of these processes are missing or dysfunctional.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathways of thrombin-stimulated fibrin clot formation and plasmin-induced clot lysis are linked and carefully regulated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81428\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81428 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When they work in coordinated harmony, a clot is laid down initially to stop bleeding, followed by eventual clot lysis and tissue remodeling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal bleeding can result from diminished thrombin generation (eg, due to factor VIII deficiency) or enhanced clot lysis (eg, due to alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency). Conversely, excessive production of thrombin (eg, due to an inherited thrombophilia) can lead to thrombosis.</p><p/><p>The elements responsible for normal hemostasis will be reviewed here. Approaches to the patient with abnormal bleeding or abnormal thrombosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The uses of platelet function testing and coagulation assays to diagnose hemostatic abnormalities are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Normal platelet function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-biology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet biology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Injury to the endothelium leads to exposure of the circulating blood to subendothelial elements from which it would normally be protected, and endothelial cell activation may further promote recruitment of platelets, other cell types, and procoagulant factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-endothelium-a-primer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The endothelium: A primer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The functional response of activated platelets involves four different processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesion &ndash; The deposition of platelets on the subendothelial matrix</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggregation &ndash; Platelet-platelet cohesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secretion &ndash; The release of platelet granule proteins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procoagulant activity &ndash; The enhancement of thrombin generation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of physiologic platelet stimuli including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, thrombin, and collagen. ADP and epinephrine are relatively weak platelet activators, while collagen and thrombin are the most potent platelet activators.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Collagen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intact endothelium prevents the adherence of platelets by the production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Intimal injury impairs these processes and exposes subendothelial elements such as microfibrils, laminin, and collagen. These factors lead to the adherence of platelets, platelet activation, and secretion.</p><p>Integrins are a superfamily of adhesive protein receptors that are found in many different cell types. The integrin glycoproteins <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIa/IIa</span> (also known as alpha2 beta1) and GPVI are the two most important platelet collagen receptors, playing critical roles in platelet adhesion and activation, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIa/IIa</span> deficiency generally have mild bleeding diathesis, while severe spontaneous bleeding has been reported with platelet GPVI deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombin activation of cells is mediated by a family of G-protein coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Platelets have a dual receptor system for thrombin, with two distinct receptors (PAR-1 and PAR-4). Thrombin cleaves the amino-terminal exodomain of PAR, exposing a new amino-terminus, which then serves as a tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to initiate transmembrane signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. PAR-1 is a high-affinity receptor that mediates the effect of thrombin at low concentrations; PAR-4 is a low-affinity receptor that requires high levels of thrombin for activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vorapaxar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vorapaxar</a> is an oral PAR-1 antagonist developed as an antiplatelet agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>In an animal model of laser-induced vascular injury, it was shown that the tissue factor-mediated pathway of thrombin generation, rather than the collagen-induced GPVI-mediated pathway, was the major route leading to platelet activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385566943\"><span class=\"h3\">ADP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADP binds to two G-protein coupled purinergic receptors, P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>12</sub>. Activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> leads to calcium mobilization, platelet shape change, and rapidly reversible aggregation; activation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> leads to platelet secretion and more stable aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. ADP is released from platelets upon platelet activation and functions in a <span class=\"nowrap\">paracrine/autocrine</span> fashion to recruit additional platelets and amplify platelet aggregation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clopidogrel</a> blocks the activation of P2Y<sub>12</sub>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet adhesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following activation, platelets undergo significant shape changes, producing elongated pseudopods that make the platelets extremely adhesive. Platelet adhesion is primarily mediated by the binding of platelet surface receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIb/IX/V</span> complex to von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the subendothelial matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Deficiency of any component of the <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIb/IX/V</span> complex or VWF leads to congenital bleeding disorders: Bernard-Soulier disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and von Willebrand disease, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia#H20171374\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Causes of thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, there are other adhesive interactions that contribute to platelet adhesion. One example is binding of the platelet collagen receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIa/IIa</span> to collagen fibrils in the matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet aggregation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelet activation results in both exposure of and conformational changes in the <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> receptor on the platelet surface, leading to binding of both immobilized VWF and fibrinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> is also a member of the integrin superfamily. The <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> complex (integrin alpha IIb beta 3) is the most abundant receptor on the platelet surface, with about 80,000 complexes per platelet. <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> does not bind fibrinogen, a divalent symmetrical molecule that bridges activated platelets, on nonstimulated platelets. However, following platelet stimulation (eg, by thrombin, collagen, or ADP), <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> undergoes a conformational change and is converted from a low-affinity to a high-affinity fibrinogen receptor, a process referred to as &quot;inside-out&quot; signaling (since the conformational change in the external cell surface exposed <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> complex is mediated by changes in the intracellular cytosolic portion [&quot;cytoplasmic tail&quot;] of the complex). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-biology#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet biology&quot;, section on 'GPIIb/IIIa activation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-fibrinogen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of fibrinogen&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to mediating platelet aggregation, when <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> binds to immobilized VWF, the cytosolic portion of the activated <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> complex binds to the platelet cytoskeleton, resulting in platelet spreading and clot retraction, which has been referred to as &quot;outside-in&quot; integrin signaling. Thus, the <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> complex integrates receptor-ligand interactions that occur on the external face of the membrane with cytosolic events in a bidirectional fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]; it is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation, irrespective of the mode of platelet stimulation.</p><p>The importance of <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> is illustrated by the bleeding disorder in Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which is characterized by mutations in the gene for either the alpha IIb or the beta-3 subunit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], as well as the clinical utility of <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> antagonists in the treatment of coronary heart disease.

The alpha granules contain many proteins including fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), platelet factor 4, and P-selectin. Dense granules contain ADP, ATP, ionized calcium, histamine, and serotonin. Platelets secrete a variety of substances from their granules upon cell stimulation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADP and serotonin stimulate and recruit additional platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Platelet-released serotonin normally causes vasodilation; however, it can induce vasoconstriction in the presence of damaged or abnormal (dysfunctional) endothelium. ADP-activated platelets increase the surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibronectin and thrombospondin are adhesive proteins that may reinforce and stabilize platelet aggregates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrinogen is released from platelet alpha granules, providing a source of fibrinogen at sites of endothelial injury in addition to that present in plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboxane A2, a prostaglandin metabolite, promotes vasoconstriction and further platelet aggregation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth factors, such as PDGF, have potent mitogenic effect on smooth muscle cells. The release of PDGF from platelets at the site of vascular injury probably mediates tissue repair physiologically and, at a site of repeated injuries, may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary reocclusion following angioplasty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of platelets in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of the thiol isomerase, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), by platelets and disrupted vessel wall cells may serve to activate tissue factor and enhance the generation of fibrin and platelet thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Procoagulant activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelet procoagulant activity is an important aspect of platelet activation and involves both exposure of procoagulant phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylserine, and the subsequent assembly of the enzyme complexes in the clotting cascade on the platelet surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These complexes are an important example of the close interrelationship between platelet activation and activation of the clotting cascade. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Multicomponent complexes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9533866\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulant activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulant activities provided by platelets are less well studied. One example may be an endogenous thrombin inhibitor involved in vascular regulation.

As an example, the generation of a small number of factor VIIa molecules will activate many molecules of factor X, which in turn generates even larger numbers of thrombin molecules, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a>). The resultant local generation of fibrin, in turn, enmeshes and reinforces the platelet plug.</p><p>The function of the active enzymes is markedly facilitated by the formation of multiple component macromolecular complexes, such as the tenases (X-ase) that activate factor X and the prothrombinase which produces thrombin from prothrombin. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Multicomponent complexes'</a> below.)</p><p>All of the procoagulants are synthesized in the liver except for von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, and factor VIII, which is produced in endothelial cells in the liver as well as other tissues such as lymphatics and renal glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. VWF stabilizes factor VIII.

The best characterized modifications occur in the vitamin K-dependent procoagulants (ie, prothrombin, factors VII, IX, and X) and anticoagulants (ie, protein C and protein S). For each of these factors, vitamin K-dependent carboxylated glutamic acid residues function as calcium-binding sites that are important in the assembly of the membrane-bound macromolecular procoagulant complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

This view of coagulation is useful for interpreting in vitro tests of coagulation.

The small initial amount of thrombin generated then activates factor XI in a feedback manner, leading to <strong>amplification</strong> of thrombin generation. This was shown via the time course of thrombin generation, which demonstrated an initiation phase with only a small amount of thrombin being generated, followed by a propagation phase consisting of the bulk of thrombin generation, and finally cessation of thrombin generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Standard laboratory clotting tests, which detect initial fibrin clot formation, primarily measure the initiation and not the propagation phase of clotting.

Thus, the initial small amount of generated thrombin primes the clotting cascade and activates platelets, which then leads to explosive thrombin generation.

Despite their structural relatedness, they display remarkable specificity towards their substrates (eg, FIXa activates factor X but not prothrombin (factor II) or fibrinogen). This substrate specificity results from the structural requirement of the substrate to be aligned properly (&quot;docked&quot;) with the enzyme before proteolytic cleavage of the substrate can take place. This docking is mediated by an exosite on the enzyme surface that lies outside the active catalytic site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97057 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The advantages of these multicomponent enzyme complexes can be illustrated by the prothrombinase complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. When platelets are activated, anionic lipids &ndash; primarily phosphatidylserine &ndash; become exposed on the platelet surface, and factor V, stored in platelet granules, is released and bound to these anionic lipids. Factor V is activated to factor Va by the initial trace amount of thrombin generated from interactions between tissue factor and factor VIIa at the wound site. Together with the appropriate anionic membrane phospholipids and calcium, this activated factor Xa and its cofactor, factor Va, form the prothrombinase complex, which cleaves prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa).</p><p>Because of its extremely favorable local proximity, thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex is approximately 300,000 times more efficient compared with that generated by factor Xa and prothrombin alone. In addition, factor Xa bound to factor Va is also relatively protected from inhibition by circulating inhibitors such as antithrombin. The net effect is that thrombin generation is dramatically enhanced on the surface of activated platelets and restricted to sites of vascular injury.</p><p>The importance of the procoagulant effect of platelets in the assembly of multicomponent complexes is illustrated by congenital platelet function disorders in which the platelet membrane phospholipids do not change in response to platelet activation.

It is ubiquitous in biology and can vary from a few to several thousand phosphate units in polymer length, depending on the organisms and tissues from which it is derived. In microorganisms, polyP is synthesized from ATP and may serve as an energy store allowing the bacteria to resynthesize ATP in times of starvation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. PolyP is also stored in human platelet dense granules and is efficiently released upon platelet activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In contrast to microbial polyP, platelet polyP is smaller, consisting of 60 to 100 phosphate units.</p><p>With its multiple anionic charges, polyP is a potent procoagulant, and it likely represents the &quot;physiological&quot; or &quot;pathological&quot; negatively charged surface that triggers blood coagulation via the intrinsic pathway. The source of polyP in this setting may derive from injured tissues at the wound site or a microbial source in the case of an infection. In addition to triggering intrinsic pathway activation, polyP has other effects on blood clotting. It accelerates factor V activation, abrogates the inhibitory effect of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), enhances fibrin polymerization (making the fibrils thicker), and accelerates factor XI activation by thrombin. The potency of polyP is dependent on its chain length. Long-chain polyP (from a microbial source) is efficient in carrying out all four functions, while medium-size polyP (from platelets) is less effective in triggering the intrinsic pathway but effective in accelerating blood clotting once it is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Deficiencies of intrinsic contact pathway proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic relevance of the initial complex of the intrinsic contact pathway is not fully established.

One likely mechanism is that thrombin feedback activates factor XI, with polyP, released from activated platelets or derived from injured tissues, serving as a cofactor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/66-68,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68,79</a>]. Factor XIa then activates factor IX, which leads to further thrombin formation after the clot has been formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>This interpretation is also consistent with the phenotype observed in mice deficient in either factor XII or factor XI. These mice do not exhibit any bleeding problems under normal circumstances, similar to patients deficient in factor XII or factor XI, but surprisingly, they are protected from arterial thrombosis in experimental thrombosis models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. In this regard, it is notable that patients severely deficient in factor XI (&lt;15 percent), are reported to be protected from ischemic stroke but not myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Further evidence for the lack of spontaneous bleeding with factor XI deficiency comes from a trial in which antisense therapy was used to lower the activity of factor XI to approximately 20 percent of normal in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery; this was able to reduce the incidence of venous thrombosis without increasing bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms of factor XII have also been linked to an increased incidence of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. These data suggest that the additional thrombin generated via the tertiary amplification pathway, involving factor XII or factor XI, may play more of a role in pathological thrombosis rather than physiological hemostasis.</p><p>This mechanism also provides a rationale by which bleeding can occur in patients with factor XI deficiency: increased fibrinolysis due to diminished activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/67,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,87,88</a>].

Thus, in the absence of factor XI, sufficient TAFI is not generated in order to protect the clot from lysis.

These interactions are complex and include contributions of hemostatic factors to host defense as well as effects of immune mediators on hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/169-171\" class=\"abstract_t\">169-171</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated protein C (APC), in addition to its well-established anticoagulant role in inhibiting FVa and FVIIIa, also has cellular cytoprotective effects. This is dependent on APC binding to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR).EPCR-bound APC (but not free APC) cleaves endothelial protease activated receptor (PAR)-1, resulting in cell signaling and the initiation of a cell protective program that includes anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities and stabilization of endothelial barriers to prevent vascular leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. The finding that this cytoprotective effect of APC is dependent on cleavage of PAR-1 is surprising and puzzling since thrombin cleavage of endothelial PAR-1 leads to a prothrombotic phenotype and disrupts the endothelial barrier integrity, the opposite of the <span class=\"nowrap\">APC/EPCR-PAR-1</span> signaling effect. The mechanisms for this remarkable change in signaling profile are under investigation. The <span class=\"nowrap\">APC/EPCR-PAR-1</span> signaling may involve different coupling with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. There is also evidence that <span class=\"nowrap\">APC/EPCR</span> cleaves PAR-1 at Arg46 rather than a Arg41 (which is cleaved by thrombin), resulting in a different signaling program from that of thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2) is also not limited to dampening fibrinolysis. CPB2 can inactivate activated complement components C3a and C5a, the major anaphylatoxins resulting from complement activation, and bradykinin (BK), potent inflammatory mediators found at sites of inflammation; inactivation is achieved by removing the carboxy-terminal arginine residue from these inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus the activation of protein C and pro-CPB2 by the thrombin-TM complex on endothelial cells may serve as a negative homeostatic mechanism to down-regulate thrombin's inflammatory activities in the cross-talk between coagulation, inflammation, and innate immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemostasis/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>].

Abnormal bleeding can result from diminished clot generation or enhanced clot lysis, while excessive clot formation or reduced clot lysis can lead to excessive thrombosis. The following phases coordinate this overall process. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Phases of the hemostatic process'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Platelets are activated at the site of vascular injury to form a platelet plug that provides the initial hemostatic response, including exposure of procoagulant phospholipids on the platelet surface and the assembly of components of the clotting cascade.

This phase is critical in mediating the extent of clot formation, as demonstrated by the thrombotic disorders present in individuals with abnormalities in this pathway.
