There should be no evidence of atrial fibrillation on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and on 24-hour cardiac monitoring.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p>We suggest performing an evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in all patients with cryptogenic stroke who have a PFO (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F116026\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116026 \">algorithm 1</a>) as identification of DVT can help strengthen the clinical inference of paradoxical embolism and also has important implications for therapy (including identifying an indication for anticoagulation which impacts the timing and need for PFO device closure).</p><p>Given the high prevalence of PFO in the general population and the low risk of stroke related to PFO, there is always some degree of uncertainty about the causal relationship between PFO and a cryptogenic ischemic stroke. The possibility that the PFO is an &quot;innocent bystander&quot; and that another mechanisms is responsible for the stroke is particularly applicable to older patients and to those with known risk factors for stroke (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Causality can best be inferred in younger patients with no other apparent etiology for stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], particularly if DVT is present (as a potential source for paradoxical emboli). Thrombus trapped in a PFO has rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>We include age &le;60 as a criterion in our recommendation for PFO closure for secondary stroke prevention as the association between PFO and stroke was strongest in this subgroup and this age cut-off was used in the supporting clinical trials (see <a href=\"#H2119715523\" class=\"local\">'Benefit'</a> below). Other criteria for identifying patients with an embolic-appearing cryptogenic stroke likely to benefit from PFO closure have not been established. Although the RoPE score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97895\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97895 \">table 3</a>) is not validated for selecting patients who might benefit from PFO closure, it may be helpful to support the decision to proceed with PFO closure in patients with very high RoPE scores, or to decline PFO closure in patients with very low RoPE scores. The RoPE score estimates the probability that a PFO is incidental or pathogenic in a patient with cryptogenic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The PFO-attributable fraction of stroke derived from the RoPE score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97896 \">table 4</a>) varies widely and decreases with age and the presence of vascular risk factors. High RoPE scores, as found in younger patients who lack vascular risk factors and have a cortical infarct on neuroimaging, suggest pathogenic PFOs. In contrast, low RoPE scores, as found in older patients with vascular risk factors, suggest incidental PFOs. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H317856435\"><span class=\"h3\">Exclusions to device closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with venous thromboembolism that is provoked by a known event or an identifiable transient risk factor are generally treated with anticoagulation for 3 to 12 months. In such cases, PFO device closure, if otherwise indicated, can be postponed until anticoagulation is stopped. For patients with an embolic-appearing stroke who have an indication for chronic anticoagulation (eg, unprovoked or recurrent deep venous thrombosis), the benefit of PFO closure is uncertain. For patients with an embolic-appearing stroke who have an indication for chronic anticoagulation, we suggest an individualized multidisciplinary decision making based on the risks of thrombosis, embolism, and intervention in deciding whether to proceed with chronic anticoagulation alone or to also perform PFO closure (by percutaneous device or by surgery). </p><p>Other exclusions to percutaneous device closure include the presence of an inferior vena cava filter, elevated bleeding risk or coagulopathy, and vascular, cardiac, or PFO anatomy that is unsuitable for device placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2220394583\"><span class=\"h3\">Informed decision making</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consideration of PFO closure, including benefits, risks, and alternative treatment options must be discussed with the patient by the neurologist and cardiologist.

The trials that found clear benefit for PFO device closure were likely positive because of several factors. First, these latter trials enrolled subjects when off-label PFO closure had waned to some extent, and thus it is possible that patients who were more likely to benefit were included in these studies. Furthermore, to varying degrees for the individual studies, they included a requirement for neuroimaging confirmation of stroke prior to enrollment, excluded lacunar infarcts, provided longer follow-up, and selected patients with PFO features (ie, large shunt size, or presence of an associated ASA) that may portend an increased risk of paradoxical embolism. Meta-analyses of closure trials consistently show that patients in the PFO closure groups had increased rates of newly-detected atrial fibrillation compared with the medical therapy groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Multiple agitated saline contrast injections may be required to identify (or exclude) shunt via the PFO. In some cases, intermittent flow through the PFO is also visualized by color Doppler. Echocardiography (usually TEE) is often performed during the evaluation of patients with acute ischemic stroke in order to detect potential cardiogenic and aortic sources of cerebral emboli including PFO, and is an essential component of a comprehensive evaluation for cryptogenic stroke (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke#H2439011651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;, section on 'Cardiac and aortic evaluation'</a>).

The length of the PFO tunnel is also assessed. If a PFO is accompanied by one or more secundum-type ASDs, the location and size of these defects are examined to determine whether all the defects can be closed percutaneously by one or two devices, and whether a surgical approach might be preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3946313606\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous PFO closure should be performed using an approved PFO closure device. Access to the right atrium is established via the right femoral vein and the PFO is crossed with a guidewire or catheter under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. After the left atrium is accessed, an exchange-length stiff guidewire is advanced into a pulmonary vein. Balloon sizing may be used to determine the size of the device (typically twice the size of the balloon-stretched diameter of the defect). After the balloon is withdrawn, the delivery system is advanced into the left atrium over the guidewire. The device and the delivery system are flushed prior to insertion and the catheters aspirated to avoid air embolism. The left-sided occluder is opened in the left-atrium and retracted against the interatrial septum before the right-sided occluder is opened. After device position is confirmed by echocardiography, the closure device is released from the delivery system. Echocardiography is performed after device release to assess for residual shunting and presence of any complications. </p><p>The echocardiographic guidance is achieved by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) or TEE. ICE, performed via a second venous access to the right atrium, is generally preferred as it avoids the general anesthesia and intubation required for TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Risk is implicit during long airplane flights. For long-distance travelers with individual risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), we suggest frequent ambulation and calf exercises, avoidance of dehydration or sedatives, and graduated compression stockings to reduce the risk of travel-associated VTE.

Recurrent ischemic stroke may occur in patients with a PFO, regardless of whether the PFO was closed, due to mechanisms unrelated to paradoxical embolism, such as cardiogenic embolism, large artery atherosclerosis, small artery disease, and other determined stroke etiologies. In a minority of patients with PFO closure, a residual shunt persists, allowing continued potential risk for paradoxical embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Alternatively, thrombus may spontaneously form on or adjacent to the PFO device or in the left atrium due to stagnant blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], particularly given the possible increased risk of atrial arrhythmias (mainly atrial fibrillation) in patients with PFO <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atrial septal aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

For example, while awaiting the results of long-term cardiac monitoring, some experts would start empiric oral anticoagulation at hospital discharge for patients with acute embolic stroke that is cryptogenic after standard evaluation if there are multiple risk factors for occult atrial fibrillation. These include higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 5</a>), the presence of cortical or large subcortical infarcts in multiple vascular territories, and evidence of left atrial cardiopathy (eg, left atrial dilatation, strain, reduced emptying fraction, left atrial appendage size and single lobe morphology, P wave dispersion on electrocardiogram (ECG), and frequent atrial premature beats). Further antithrombotic treatment is directed by the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation detected on 30-day cardiac monitoring, and the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation if detected. Ongoing studies of embolic stroke from undetermined source (ESUS) may inform these decisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare cases, recurrent thrombus formation on the closure device despite anticoagulant therapy may require device removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87751471\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL CLOSURE OF PFO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For rare patients aged &le;60 years with a cryptogenic embolic-appearing ischemic stroke who have a PFO and no other evident source of stroke despite a comprehensive evaluation who have a concurrent indication for cardiac surgery (eg, indication for valve surgery, or the rare PFO that is not amenable to device closure for technical reasons), surgical closure of PFO via standard or minimally invasive (including robotic) techniques for secondary stroke prevention after cryptogenic stroke is a reasonable alternative to percutaneous PFO closure.</p><p>The reported efficacy of surgical closure of a PFO in patients with prior cerebrovascular ischemic events has been variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/11,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39-41</a>], and randomized trials comparing surgical PFO closure with percutaneous closure or with medical therapy have not been performed.</p><p>Rates of recurrent cerebrovascular events following surgical closure have ranged from 7 to 14 percent at one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>].

The overall freedom from an ischemic episode at one and four years was 93 and 83 percent, respectively.

(See <a href=\"#H87751471\" class=\"local\">'Surgical closure of PFO'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO who are age &gt;60 years, we suggest antiplatelet therapy rather than percutaneous PFO closure or anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An exception applies to selected patients with strong clinical evidence of paradoxical embolus, including patients with acute deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or other venous thromboembolism, who are generally treated with anticoagulation for at least several months and potentially indefinitely if the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was unprovoked or if they have a meaningful thrombophilia. (See <a href=\"#H3128111548\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients considered for PFO closure should have a comprehensive evaluation by both a stroke neurologist and a cardiologist to ensure that the diagnosis is cryptogenic ischemic stroke and that the most likely mechanism is paradoxical embolism through a PFO. (See <a href=\"#H4248518697\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for cryptogenic stroke'</a> above and <a href=\"#H193434890\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for PFO'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1096368391\" class=\"local\">'Is PFO the most likely stroke mechanism?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a previous cryptogenic stroke treated with antiplatelet therapy but not PFO closure who have a recurrent embolic-appearing cryptogenic stroke, we suggest PFO closure. Irrespective of whether the PFO was closed after the initial cryptogenic stroke, additional options for cryptogenic stroke recurrence include continuing the same antiplatelet agent or switching to another antiplatelet regimen. For patients with recurrent embolic stroke of undetermined source, switching to empiric anticoagulant therapy is also a reasonable option.
