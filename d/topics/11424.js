It lacks a cell wall and is thus not visible following Gram staining. With a genome of only 580 kilobases in size, <em>M. genitalium</em> is the smallest known self-replicating bacterium. Its genomic structure is similar to the larger and more well-known pathogen <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, a cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

On culture, <em>M. genitalium</em> does not produce hemolysis, and its colonies look like a &quot;fried egg,&quot; having a dense center and paler outer zone.

Studies in both male and female nonhuman primates, in which genital infection developed following urogenital inoculation of <em>M. genitalium</em>, demonstrate its pathogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A specialized terminal tip-like structure allows <em>M. genitalium</em> to attach to, adhere to the surface of, and enter cells. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Upon entry into the epithelial cell, <em>M. genitalium</em> evades the host immune response through modulation of the immune system, including suppression and stimulation of lymphocytes and upregulation of cytokine expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The tissue destruction caused by <em>M. genitalium</em> is partially due to the secretion of mycoplasmal toxins and harmful metabolites like hydrogen peroxide. However, the majority of clinical disease associated with <em>M. genitalium</em> infection is thought to be due to the host&rsquo;s immune response to cell invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. <em>M. genitalium</em> can persist for months or years in infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11966231\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860473\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiological studies have suggested a strong etiological link between <em>M. genitalium</em> infection and urethritis in men and a moderate etiological link with cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11966254\"><span class=\"h3\">Nongonococcal urethritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with <em>M. genitalium</em> has been strongly associated with acute nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). In a meta-analysis of 19 observational studies that evaluated <em>M. genitalium</em> infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, 436 of 2069 patients with NGU (21.1 percent) had <em>M. genitalium</em> detected compared with 121 of 1810 controls (6.7 percent, pooled odds ratio [OR] 3.8, 95% CI 3.0-4.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>]. Subsequent systematic reviews of additional observational studies have supported this association, which is particularly strong in cases of nonchlamydial NGU (NCNGU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>].</p><p><em>M. genitalium</em> infection accounts for 15 to 20 percent of NGU cases reported per year among men in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among men with NCNGU, <em>M. genitalium</em> has been detected in 18 to 46 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Similarly, <em>M. genitalium</em> detection is frequent in men with persistent or recurrent urethritis following empiric therapy, particularly when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/19,28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28,31</a>].

Overall, cumulative evidence suggests an association between <em>M. genitalium</em> and cervicitis, although some results are conflicting. In a meta-analysis of 20 studies, most of which employed in-house PCR testing to identify <em>M. genitalium</em>, detection of the organism was associated with cervicitis (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.35-2.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In one study included in the meta-analysis, of 719 women who had cervical specimens obtained at an STI clinic, women with <em>M. genitalium</em> detected by PCR were more likely to have mucopurulent cervicitis (defined by the presence of either visible purulent discharge or &ge;30 polymorphonuclear cells [PMNs] per high power field on Gram stain of cervical smear) compared with those without detectable <em>M. genitalium</em> (48 versus 28.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After controlling for infections with other STIs that cause cervicitis, the study observed a threefold increased risk of mucopurulent cervicitis in women infected with <em>M. genitalium</em>.</p><p>In contrast, other studies of high-risk female populations have failed to demonstrate an association between <em>M. genitalium</em> detection and cervicitis, despite high <em>M. genitalium</em> detection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. As an example, in a study of 331 adolescent women presenting with genitourinary symptoms or STI risk factors to an urban health center in the United States, <em>M. genitalium</em> was detected in 22.4 percent but was not associated with vaginal symptoms or signs (purulent cervical discharge or cervical friability) of cervicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Inconsistent associations between <em>M. genitalium</em> and cervicitis are likely due to the lack of a standard definition of cervicitis.

Nevertheless, in such settings, we favor directed therapy for <em>M. genitalium</em> given its associations with urogenital disease and HIV infection as well as the possibility of very subtle presentations of these syndromes.

(See <a href=\"#H11966203\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H860473\" class=\"local\">'Disease associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>M. genitalium</em> is a member of the Mycoplasmataceae family of bacteria. It is not visible following Gram staining because of its lack of a cell wall, and culture of the organism is difficult.<em> M. genitalium </em>has been isolated from multiple tissue sites, including the respiratory tract and synovial fluid, but its association with clinical disease appears to be limited to the urogenital tract. (See <a href=\"#H11966210\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11966217\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of <em>M. genitalium</em> is approximately 1 percent in the general population but is considerably higher among individuals at high risk for other sexually transmitted infections. The risk factors for <em>M. genitalium</em> infection are similar to those associated with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> infection, and include young age, nonwhite race, and an increasing number of recent sexual partners. (See <a href=\"#H11966231\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of <em>M. genitalium</em> urogenital infection are similar to those caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection in both men and women. Urethritis caused by <em>M. genitalium</em> is typically symptomatic, whereas women with cervicitis associated with <em>M. genitalium</em> are more frequently asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H11966282\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are currently no commercially available detection methods for <em>M. genitalium</em>. However, if locally available, the diagnosis of <em>M. genitalium</em> infection can be made through detection of the organism using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), on urogenital specimens such as first-void urine in men and a vaginal or cervical swab in women. (See <a href=\"#H11966311\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to therapy of <em>M. genitalium</em> depends on the timing of presentation, the availability of <em>M. genitalium</em> testing, and the treatment history. (See <a href=\"#H11966325\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients initially presenting with signs or symptoms of urethritis, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease should be treated empirically based on the recommendations for the presenting syndrome. We suggest not basing the choice of empiric regimen on the possibility of <em>M. genitalium</em> infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
