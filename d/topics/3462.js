CGD is caused by defects in phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (phox). The cornerstones of CGD management are antimicrobial and immunomodulatory prophylaxis, early diagnosis of infections, and aggressive management of infectious complications.</p><p>CGD was initially termed &quot;fatal granulomatous disease of childhood&quot; because patients rarely survived past their first decade in the time before routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. The average patient now survives at least 40 years. Overall, survival rates are better for females than males, reflecting the greater severity of X-linked CGD.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of CGD are reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of CGD, as well as an overview of primary disorders of phagocytic function, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary disorders of phagocytic function: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of CGD focuses on aggressive diagnosis and treatment of infections. The reduction in mortality and morbidity seen over the past few decades is largely attributable to antimicrobial prophylaxis and rapid recognition and treatment of infections in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The cornerstones of CGD management are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifelong antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early diagnosis of infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive management of infectious complications</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial prophylaxis in CGD patients relies on a combination of antibacterial and antifungal therapy with or without immunomodulatory therapy. The triad of therapies used in the United States is the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibacterial &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX or cotrimoxazole)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifungal &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunomodulatory &ndash; Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)</p><p/><p>This combination therapy dramatically reduces the rate of severe infections from one per patient-year to almost one every 10 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,6</a>]. IFN-gamma therapy is less commonly used outside of the United States. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunomodulatory therapy with interferon-gamma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibacterial prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lifelong antibacterial prophylaxis is the standard of care for patients with CGD despite the lack of randomized trials examining this approach. There are several retrospective series that suggest that TMP-SMX is effective in preventing bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-9</a>]. Lifelong antibacterial prophylaxis with TMP-SMX (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> up to a maximum of 320 mg, based upon the TMP component, administered orally in two divided daily doses) is therefore suggested. Several centers use once-daily dosing to enhance treatment adherence. Alternatives for patients allergic to sulfonamide drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> without sulfamethoxazole, beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dicloxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dicloxacillin</a>), cephalosporins, or fluoroquinolones.</p><p>In one of these series, 11 patients were followed both on and off of antibacterial prophylaxis. TMP-SMX lowered the incidence of bacterial infections from 15.8 per 100 patient-months to 6.9 per 100 patient-months in patients with X-linked CGD (n = 4) and from 7.1 to 2.4 per 100 patient-months in patients with autosomal recessive (AR) CGD (n = 7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. TMP-SMX prophylaxis did not result in an increase in fungal infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Antifungal prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advent and evolution of the azole antifungal drugs have dramatically altered the clinical consequences of fungal infections in CGD. Lifelong antifungal prophylaxis is the standard of care for patients with CGD. Several observational series and a single randomized trial demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> is highly effective as antifungal prophylaxis in CGD, although fungal infections can still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-14</a>]. Itraconazole (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> oral solution administered once daily, maximum dose 200 mg) is the recommended therapy for lifelong antifungal prophylaxis. Itraconazole-resistant fungal infections do occur, but most have been responsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>In the randomized trial, 39 patients were assigned to receive either placebo or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (100 mg orally per day in patients aged 5 to 12 years; 200 mg orally per day in patients &ge;13 years old or &ge;50 kg) for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thereafter, they alternated between itraconazole and placebo annually. All patients were on antibacterial prophylaxis, and most received prophylactic IFN-gamma. Seven invasive fungal infections requiring systemic therapy were reported in patients while receiving placebo compared with only one serious fungal infection while on itraconazole (this single patient was reported as noncompliant with the antifungal prophylaxis).</p><p>In one series of 67 adult patients, 24 of 29 patients with invasive fungal respiratory infections were on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, of the seven patients who had serum itraconazole levels measured, five had low levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunomodulatory therapy with interferon-gamma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunomodulatory therapy with IFN-gamma is part of the prophylactic regimen in some centers in the United States, although it has not been as widely adopted in other countries. Issues impacting the use of IFN-gamma in CGD patients around the world include the need for administration by injection, cost, and lack of general familiarity with cytokine therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,17</a>]. Additionally, it has been argued that CGD prognosis has improved significantly since the advent of routine antifungal prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, lessening the need for adjunctive, costly immunomodulatory therapy.</p><p>Despite these uncertainties, we suggest IFN-gamma (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>2</sup></span> subcutaneously three times per week) as part of the prophylactic therapy for CGD, especially for those who have had more severe recurrent infections. For children less than 0.5 m<sup>2</sup>, 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> subcutaneously three times weekly is the suggested dose. Fever and myalgias are the most common adverse events associated with IFN-gamma. These side effects are minimized by concomitant administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and dosing of IFN-gamma before bedtime and usually ameliorate over time.</p><p>An international, multicenter, randomized trial examined prophylactic treatment with IFN-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One-hundred twenty-eight patients with CGD (median age 15 years, range 4 to 24 years old) received IFN-gamma 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or placebo subcutaneously three times weekly for an average of 8.9 months. Forty-six percent of patients in the placebo group developed at least one serious infection during the follow-up period compared with 22 percent in the IFN-gamma group. Twelve months after randomization, 77&plusmn;0.06 percent (mean &plusmn; standard error [SE]) of patients in the IFN-gamma group had not yet developed a serious infection, whereas only 30&plusmn;0.11 percent of patients in the placebo group were free of serious infection. This improvement was independent of age, CGD genotype, or concomitant use of other prophylactic agents. However, there was no improvement in superoxide production by phagocytes in treated patients. In addition, no decrease in <em>Aspergillus</em> infections was demonstrated.</p><p>One major limitation of the randomized trial was that other experimental drugs, which included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> at the time, were excluded. Results from earlier observational studies of prophylactic IFN-gamma therapy in which most patients were not on itraconazole are consistent with the randomized trial. Three prospective, open-label, phase-IV studies confirmed the decreased rate of serious infections, ranging from a rate of 0.13 to 0.4 per patient-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18,19</a>]. However, a prospective study comparing treatment with TMP-SMX and itraconazole with or without IFN-gamma found no change in the rate of severe infection (0.01 severe infections per patient-year in both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, many studies suggest a benefit to prophylactic IFN-gamma in addition to TMP-SMX. However, it is not clear how much additional benefit, if any, prophylactic IFN-gamma provides beyond that of TMP-SMX combined with itraconazole.</p><p>The mechanism of IFN-gamma benefit in patients with CGD remains unclear. It is also unclear whether all patients with CGD benefit equally. Early studies indicated that there were some patients with permissive defects who were more responsive to IFN-gamma in vitro in terms of superoxide production. A subgroup of patients with X-linked CGD have IFN-gamma responsive splice-site defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In these patients, IFN-gamma therapy improved the ability to generate superoxide. Further study is needed to clarify whether there are additional subpopulations of patients who benefit from IFN-gamma therapy and other groups that do not. However, upregulation of superoxide may not be the critical mechanism of IFN-gamma action, since the previous studies showed efficacy in most subgroups and IFN-gamma had activity in a mouse model incapable of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23</a>].</p><p>The use of IFN-gamma in the setting of acute infection is of uncertain value. Some experts use IFN-gamma only in the setting of infection, rather than as prophylaxis, but the reasons for this are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. We suggest discontinuing IFN-gamma in the setting of an acute infection since antimicrobials are of much greater value in this setting, and the addition of IFN-gamma often causes increases in temperature and malaise, obscuring clinical response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665897856\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination in CGD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination is contraindicated in CGD as it may lead to severe local and regional BCG disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Live bacterial vaccines are probably best avoided (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>). Live viral vaccines are recommended since viral infections are handled normally in CGD. All inactivated or subunit vaccines are recommended, following the same schedule in normal children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in patients with primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening infections may occur at any time in patients with CGD, even in those who have been free of infections for months or years. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious infections, particularly those caused by fungi, may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at presentation. Several interventions are suggested to monitor for and diagnose infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency with which patients with CGD should be monitored varies with age, severity, family support, and proximity to care. We suggest patients be seen yearly or more often depending upon their frequency of infections and clinical status. Significant increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein should prompt a search for hidden infections. We suggest checking both of these nonspecific markers of inflammation at every encounter to aid in early detection of occult infection. Elevation is usually obvious and occurs in response to both bacterial and fungal infections, although bacterial infections tend to elicit higher levels than fungal ones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated inflammatory marker should prompt imaging with plain radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending upon the suspected organ involved. The authors obtain chest CT scans when there are concerns about occult infection. The chest physical examination is extremely unreliable for pneumonia in patients with CGD because of the abnormal inflammatory response in the lung. The evolution of infections can be followed closely with CT (chest) or MRI or ultrasound (soft tissue) until resolution <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stabilization of the lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive microbiologic diagnosis is essential for directing therapy because the differential diagnosis for infection includes bacteria, <em>Nocardia</em>, mycobacteria, and fungi. Empiric antimicrobial treatment prior to obtaining specimens for the identification of the specific pathogen is discouraged in the absence of life-threatening infection. Biopsies to identify the pathogen should be insisted upon before the initiation of therapy and not after empirical therapy has failed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of acute infections must be aggressive. Cultures are obtained first, if possible (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and diagnosis'</a> above). Patients are then treated empirically for gram-negative, gram-positive, and fungal infections until the pathogen is identified. Several weeks of parenteral therapy are usually required, often followed by a few months of oral therapy. Ultimately, management of infections depends on the microbiology, but some general approaches can be outlined.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX, 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> based upon the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> component, maximum dose 640 mg), a fluoroquinolone or carbapenem at high dose (to cover gram-negative infection), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 12 hours for two doses followed by 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 12 hours, see drug topic for maximum doses based upon age and weight) is appropriate for pneumonias, pending microbiology and after diagnostic specimens have been obtained. Carbapenems cover the majority of gram-negative pathogens and <em>Nocardia</em>. Patients rarely develop staphylococcal pneumonias after the initiation of prophylaxis. Most <em>Burkholderia</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, and <em>Nocardia</em> infections are sensitive to TMP-SMX. The use of TMP-SMX as therapy for infections that have occurred despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis is highly effective and may reflect either dose response or a failure of patients to actually take their prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver abscesses in immunocompetent patients typically are caused by enteric organisms and are liquid and easily drainable. In contrast, liver abscesses encountered in CGD are usually staphylococcal, consist of a dense and caseous material, and often require excisional surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Glucocorticoids along with antibiotics have proved to be successful in the management of staphylococcal liver abscesses in CGD in several case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], with an associated reduction in the need for percutaneous or open liver drainage of abscesses, and are the preferred therapy for liver abscess in CGD and appear to lead to better outcomes.

These infections may respond faster to surgical excision along with antimicrobials. In view of the frequency of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) in the community, the authors start therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> and then adjust antibiotics when culture results are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-lymphadenitis-in-children-diagnostic-approach-and-initial-management#H1227480773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical lymphadenitis in children: Diagnostic approach and initial management&quot;, section on 'Initial laboratory evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Granulibacter bethesdensis</em> is a gram-negative rod that causes necrotizing lymphadenitis in CGD.

We suggest initiating therapy with TMP-SMX (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> (1 gram every eight hours) when <em>Nocardia</em> infection is suspected. Refractory cases may respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> at doses that are reduced to one-half of the dose used to treat rapidly growing bacteria, such as staphylococci. <em>Nocardia</em> live in decaying matter and therefore are often inhaled along with fungi. This is manifest by coinfection with fungi in one-third of <em>Nocardia </em>cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Glucocorticoids along with antibiotics may also help in the management of <em>Nocardia </em>pneumonias, which can be necrotic and inflammatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, fungal infections are more indolent, and bacterial infections are more acute. However, acute fulminant pneumonitis with hypoxia can occur after inhalation exposure to mulch, compost, hay, or dirt, which typically contain high levels of fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This presentation of &quot;mulch pneumonitis&quot; is virtually pathognomonic of CGD and requires urgent institution of antifungals and glucocorticoids to control severe pulmonary inflammation and hypoxia. This condition represents the simultaneous evolution of infection and inflammatory response to the fungal cell wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary site of <em>Aspergillus nidulans</em> infection is generally the lung, but it has a high propensity to spread to adjacent bone and to disseminate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Surgical debridement is indicated for <em>A. nidulans</em> infections that are refractory to medical therapy.

However, such transfusions often lead to alloimmunization, which may significantly impair the likelihood of successful hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) later on. The authors therefore view granulocyte transfusions as a last resort if medical and surgical therapy is failing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CGD patients with severe infections have been successfully treated with systemic glucocorticoids in addition to antimicrobial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, it is critical that appropriate antimicrobial therapy is in place before glucocorticoid therapy is initiated since treatment with glucocorticoids can mask symptoms and increase the risk of local spread of infection. Important examples of this are in CGD liver abscess, <em>Nocardia</em> pneumonia, and mulch pneumonitis. This is distinct from the use of glucocorticoids for granulomatous complications in CGD, such as gastric outlet obstruction or colitis.

Urologic findings include ureteral and urethral strictures, bladder granulomata, and cystitis. Other inflammatory manifestations include interstitial pneumonitis and neutrophilic dermatosis. Oral glucocorticoids are the most common therapy used for inflammatory manifestations of CGD.

In this series, eight patients with refractory inflammatory conditions were treated with thalidomide (50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally at bedtime) and followed for a median of 30 months.

As success increases and morbidity and mortality are reduced, early HCT becomes a desirable and appropriate choice for patients with CGD. However, CGD is often diagnosed in toddlers or children later than the other primary immunodeficiencies that are often diagnosed in infancy. In addition, patients with CGD can be successfully managed overall without transplantation, and untransplanted survival is better for CGD than for most other primary immunodeficiencies. Thus, the decision to undergo HCT depends upon prognosis, donor availability, access to transplantation, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preference.</p><p>While outcomes may be better in younger patients with less CGD sequelae, HCT is also useful and successful in adult patients and those with recurrent, serious infections despite prophylaxis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe, difficult-to-treat inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40,42,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,56</a>]. HCT for active infections should only be performed at centers with experience in this procedure and in the treatment of CGD infections as the risk of death is high. The general approach to HCT in patients with a primary immunodeficiency and to conditioning regimens for HCT are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Encouraging results were reported in one series of 27 mostly pediatric, European patients with CGD transplanted with unmodified marrow grafts from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings (25 out of 27) or unrelated (2 out of 27) donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Absence of pre-existing overt infection appeared as the single best prognostic factor. All patients free of infections at the time of the transplantation (18 out of 18) were alive and well at the time of publication. The four deaths in the study occurred among the nine patients suffering from uncontrolled infections at the time of the procedure. In addition, the four cases of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in those with overt infections or acute inflammatory disease at the time of the transplant.</p><p>Similar findings were reported in another series of 20 mostly pediatric patients in the United Kingdom, in which HCT-associated complications were restricted to those with pre-existing infection or inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. One-half of the donors were matched siblings, and the other one-half were unrelated donors. Patients with an unrelated donor received myeloablative conditioning with serotherapy. One patient died from multiorgan failure secondary to disseminated fungal infection after conditioning but prior to HCT. A second patient died after discharge from the hospital from iatrogenic causes related to a previous disseminated fungal infection. Two patients had significant chronic GVHD. Engraftment of neutrophils and adequate chimerism were observed in all transplanted patients. However, two patients required unconditioned bone marrow infusions from the original donors after neutrophil chimerism fell to insufficient levels after the initial engraftment. Colitis resolved, and catch-up growth was seen in the patients with colitis (n = 10) and with growth failure (n = 7) prior to HCT.</p><p>Several other studies have examined the use of myeloablative conditioning with serotherapy for patients with unrelated donors. One center performed HCT from matched, unrelated donors in nine patients with CGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Seven patients were alive and well 20 to 79 months after transplantation. Two patients with restrictive lung disease regained normal lung function. A second center reported on HCT from matched, unrelated donors in seven patients with CGD, all of whom had serious infections prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. All seven had full donor neutrophil engraftment, sustained normal levels of oxidative burst, and were alive and well at least one year posttransplant at the time of the report. Three patients developed grade-I acute GVHD of the skin that responded to topical corticosteroids.</p><p>Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have been designed to enhance engraftment and decrease organ toxicity. One such shortened and less toxic conditioning protocol using bone marrow-derived stem cells was tested in three high-risk adult patients with CGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Patients were pretreated for three weeks with intravenous antibiotics and antifungals prior to transplant. These patients survived the transplant with full donor engraftment and normal neutrophil function at 12 to 27 months.</p><p>Important to successful reduced-intensity conditioning with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> is targeted drug monitoring and dose adaptation. This requires laboratory measurement of busulfan serum levels and determination of the area under the concentration curve. This individualized approach optimizes both safety and efficacy of busulfan use since metabolism varies with age and genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Myeloablative HCT, which seeks to eradicate all recipient hematopoiesis, has a higher risk of morbidity than nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. Since only 20 percent normal cells are sufficient to prevent and control infections, as shown in lyonized females, approaches that yield stable chimerism might be effective. However, an early study in which nonmyeloablative HCT was performed in 10 patients with CGD to achieve mixed hematopoietic chimerism had poor results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Patients were given T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Immune reconstitution was successful in eight patients, but three adult patients died 8 to 14 months after the initial procedure. In patients with successful engraftment, only four serious infections occurred during the follow-up period (median 17 months), and all pre-existing granulomatous lesions resolved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1819698399\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'X-linked carriers'</a>.)</p><p>In a multicenter, prospective series, 56 patients (mean age 12.7 years, range 0 to 40) were given a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, low-dose or targeted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, and serotherapy (antithymocyte globulin, Thymoglobulin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>) prior to HCT with unmanipulated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched related donors or HLA-9 of 10 or HLA-10 of 10 matched, unrelated donors (n = 21, n = 10, and n = 25, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Forty-two patients had intractable infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> active inflammatory disease, such as colitis. Overall survival was 93 percent at a median follow-up of 21 months, and the two-year probability of survival was 96 percent, including transplants performed in the setting of ongoing infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammatory disease. All surviving patients had stable myeloid donor chimerism of at least 90 percent and had resolution of all infectious and inflammatory conditions. All six cases of acute GVHD grade-II and above and all four cases of chronic GVHD occurred in patients with HLA-matched, unrelated donors. Three patients died from GVHD-related complications. One additional patient, who had an HLA-matched, related donor, had secondary graft failure at nine months and died from hemorrhagic shock 10 days after the second HCT. Two of the surviving patients have fathered children.</p><p>Transplants from alternative donors (eg, unrelated, mismatched cord blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] or donors with less than a HLA-9 of 10 match [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] or haploidentical donors) require specialized centers and are the subject of experimental approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene therapy/gene repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CGD is well suited for gene therapy since it results from single gene defects that almost exclusively affect the hematopoietic system. Retroviral and lentiviral vectors that provide normal gp91phox, p47phox, or p67phox genes can reconstitute NADPH oxidase activity in deficient cells, establishing the proof of principle for gene therapy in CGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. A limited number of patients with CGD have been treated with gene therapy. The success rates until now have been low, and there have been severe complications including death due to development of abnormal clonal hematopoiesis caused by vector integration events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. As a result, gene therapy trials have been limited to high-risk patients with severe CGD who lack an HLA-matched donor. Gene repair of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using gene editing technology may help avoid the complications associated with traditional gene therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral blood stem cells from five adult patients with p47phox-deficient CGD were transduced ex vivo with a recombinant retrovirus containing a normal p47phox gene and then reinfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. These patients did not undergo myeloablative conditioning. Functionally corrected granulocytes were detectable in peripheral blood, but their peak frequency was only 0.004 to 0.05 percent of total peripheral granulocytes, a level well below the minimum number required for protective activity.</p><p>Subsequently, two adults with X-linked CGD received retrovirus-based gene therapy with nonmyeloablative bone marrow conditioning to allow corrected cells an opportunity for expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Both patients developed monosomy 7 secondary to insertional activation of ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], and one of the patients died 27 months after the procedure due to infection. In a different study, three adults with X-linked CGD underwent gene therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. All three patients achieved early gene marking (26, 5, and 4 percent of neutrophils contained the transferred gene, respectively), and two had sustained low-level correction. One patient had resolution of infections, with 1.1 percent marking at 34 months posttreatment, and the other had 0.03 percent marking at 11 months post-gene therapy, with partial control of infections. The third patient died of an invasive fungal infection approximately six months posttreatment after completely losing gene marking.</p><p>Novel retroviral vectors that are less prone to activating oncogenes and inducing leukemias in transduced cells are now in for use in gene therapy. A self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector, lacking the potent retroviral enhancer elements and showing decreased transactivation potential, is under study for the treatment of X-linked CGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This SIN vector is employed in a protocol that also incorporates myeloablative conditioning.</p><p>CD34+ stem cell mobilization for gene therapy is somewhat lower in patients with CGD than in normal donors, leading to fewer targets for gene correction.

Prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) became routine in the 1980s and prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> in the 1990s. Patients treated with highly active antimicrobials since diagnosis who have not yet reached 30 years are expected to have even greater longevity. However, respiratory fungal infections (primarily with <em>Aspergillus</em> species) are still the leading cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>In series with fewer than 100 patients, published survival rates at 20 years of age ranged from 73 to 87 percent, with a mean survival of approximately 18 years for patients with X-linked CGD and 36 years for AR CGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,77,78</a>]. Higher median survival (38 years for X-linked CGD and 50 years for AR CGD) was seen in a European survey of 429 patients, despite only 71 percent of patients receiving antibacterial prophylaxis and 53 percent receiving antifungal prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The median age at death increased from 15.5 years before 1990 to 28.1 years in the decade ending in 2012 in a series of 268 patients from a single center in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Residual production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) was strongly associated with increased survival, independent of the specific gene mutated, in a series of 287 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Higher levels of residual ROI production were seen in patients with p47phox mutations and gp91phox missense mutations in the first 309 amino acids of the gp91phox molecule compared with other mutations that cause CGD. This is important because it provides a genetic determinant that is directly linked to a functional test and to survival, obviating the need for functional neutrophil testing that is performed in a specialized laboratory.</p><p>Quality of life for CGD patients has also improved dramatically. Better therapies are needed for certain manifestations of CGD, such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, antimicrobial prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX, cotrimoxazole), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as well as early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of infections, have dramatically reduced the incidence of life-threatening infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Recommended dosing is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>2</sup></span> subcutaneously three times per week; for children less than 0.5 m<sup>2</sup>, 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> subcutaneously three times weekly. We would not use IFN-gamma during active infections. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunomodulatory therapy with interferon-gamma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive microbiologic diagnosis is essential for directing therapy. Biopsies to identify the exact pathogen should be insisted upon before the initiation of therapy and not after empirical therapy has failed. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of acute infections should be aggressive. Once cultures have been obtained, patients are treated empirically for gram-negative, gram-positive, <em>Nocardia</em>, and fungal infections until the pathogen is identified. Several weeks of therapy are usually required. Surgical removal of refractory fungal infections is advisable if they are localized. Curettage and drainage of liver abscesses are unnecessary as long as a microbiologic diagnosis is available, appropriate antibiotics are given, and glucocorticoids are administered. Granulocyte transfusions are an option in severe cases but are accompanied by a significant risk of alloimmunization, which may complicate subsequent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral glucocorticoids are the most common therapy used for inflammatory manifestations of CGD. Glucocorticoid-sparing therapies include long-term treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> derivatives are effective for bowel disease. Other agents have been used less frequently, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>. Use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors in patients with CGD is associated with a high risk of severe infection and death. HCT is effective in resolving inflammatory complications. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for inflammatory manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful HCT is a definitive cure for CGD. Outcomes are generally better in younger patients with less CGD sequelae, but HCT is also effective in patients with recurrent, serious infections despite prophylaxis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe, difficult-to-treat infections or inflammatory disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The morbidity and mortality of CGD have improved significantly since the advent of prophylactic antimicrobial and immunomodulatory therapy. The average age of survival is undefined in the setting of newer antimicrobials, but it is at least 40 years and will continue to increase. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1357233884\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p><p>The editorial staff at UpToDate would also like to acknowledge Sergio D Rosenzweig, MD, who contributed as an author to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Margolis DM, Melnick DA, Alling DW, Gallin JI.
