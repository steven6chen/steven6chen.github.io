Rapid improvement in pain and disability and return to work are the norm in the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Further improvement generally occurs over three months. However, given how common low back pain is, persistent symptoms affect millions of individuals. Subacute low back pain is commonly defined as back pain lasting between 4 and 12 weeks and chronic low back pain as pain that persists for 12 or more weeks. For those with chronic symptoms, few achieve the complete resolution they seek, but rather treatment focuses on controlling pain and improving activity.</p><p>This topic will address indications and outcomes of surgery for patients with subacute and chronic back pain who do not respond to more conservative treatment. Conservative and nonsurgical interventional therapies for patients with subacute and chronic low back pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonsurgical-interventional-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonsurgical interventional treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A summary of the multiple interventions for subacute and chronic low back pain discussed in these topics is presented in a set of tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72902 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61982 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77165 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63348 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Two related issues, surgical treatment for patients with lumbar stenosis and the initial management of patients with acute low back pain, are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SPINAL SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a small minority of patients suffering from low back pain ever require surgery. However, rates of surgical procedures are rising in the US, particularly for spinal fusion in patients with nonspecific back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For the small minority of low back pain patients with severe or progressive motor weakness, or signs and symptoms of cauda equina syndrome, urgent evaluation by a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon with experience in back surgery is indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Surgical treatment'</a>). There is no evidence that early referral for surgery, in the absence of severe or progressive neurologic deficits, improves outcomes for lumbar disc prolapse with radiculopathy or symptomatic spinal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>The presence of mild foot drop or other minor motor deficits due to lumbar disc prolapse with radiculopathy is <strong>not</strong> an absolute indication for surgery, because many such patients will recover with nonsurgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of severe or progressive weakness, or signs of cauda equina syndrome, surgery may be an elective option for patients with persistent disabling symptoms of low back pain and significantly impaired quality of life who have not responded to adequate trials of nonsurgical approaches. For lumbar disc prolapse with radiculopathy or symptomatic spinal stenosis, no randomized trial showing benefits of surgery has enrolled patients with less than four to six weeks of nonsurgical therapy. For nonspecific low back pain, trials of fusion surgery have only enrolled patients who have not responded to one year of nonsurgical therapies. Data are lacking on how to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from spinal fusion surgery. A systematic review of diagnostic tests found that immobilization, provocative discography, and temporary external fixation were not useful for identifying patients more likely to benefit from fusion surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No studies of facet joint blocks or MRI met inclusion criteria. Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggest that psychologic factors may be the strongest predictors of low back pain outcomes, including outcomes following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Before referring to surgery, patients should be assessed for the presence of psychologic factors (depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders) that may decrease response to any treatment for subacute or chronic low back pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical interventions fall into two broad treatment categories: radicular pain conditions, most commonly due to disc herniation or spinal stenosis with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis; and non-specific low back pain (often presumed to be related to degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs or facet joints).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN WITH DEGENERATIVE DISC CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with subacute and chronic low back pain and degenerative lumber disc disease do not have radicular symptoms or symptoms attributable to a specific condition, and are categorized as having non-specific low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is ongoing debate about the role for surgery in the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain. Surgery is not recommended for patients with non-specific subacute low back pain. Regardless of treatment (disc replacement, fusion, or nonsurgical), few patients report complete symptom resolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal fusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common surgery for chronic nonspecific low back pain with lumbar disc degenerative changes is vertebral fusion, a procedure that unites (fuses) two or more vertebral bodies together. The goal is to restrict spinal motion and remove the degenerated disc (the presumed pain generator) in order to relieve symptoms. A variety of fusion techniques are practiced. All involve the placement of a bone graft between the vertebrae. Fusion can be performed with or without supplemental hardware (instrumentation), such as plates, screws, or cages, that serve as an internal splint while the bone graft heals. Fusion alters the normal mechanics of the spine and is associated with an increase in long-term degenerative changes in adjacent spine segments.</p><p>A systematic review of four randomized trials found that disability outcomes between lumbar vertebral fusion and nonsurgical treatment did not meet US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria for clinically meaningful differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Enrolled patients had at least one year of low back pain that did not respond to standard nonsurgical therapy. Patients with significant psychiatric or somatic illness, ongoing compensation issues, or other chronic pain conditions were generally excluded. One randomized trial of 289 patients found fusion superior to unstructured nonsurgical therapy at two year follow-up for decrease in pain (33 versus 7 percent), reduction in disability (25 versus 6 percent), return to work (36 versus 13 percent) and self-perception of improvement (63 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Three trials found no clear or clinically relevant difference between surgery and nonsurgical treatment, but two trials were underpowered and a third trial had a high crossover rate between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Four-year follow-up of two of these randomized trials again failed to demonstrate any benefit of spinal fusion surgery compared with cognitive intervention and exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>One factor for the inconsistent results between trials may be the nonsurgical treatment chosen as the comparator. In trials that showed no, or only modest, differences, the nonsurgical treatment was an intensive rehabilitation program incorporating a cognitive behavioral component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In the trial that reported better results with surgery, the nonsurgical treatment intervention was less intensive and more heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The systematic review concluded that although methodologic flaws limit firm conclusions, surgery may be more effective than unstructured nonsurgical care, but may not be more effective than intense rehabilitation with cognitive behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A subsequent systematic review came to a similar conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Practice guidelines from the American Pain Society, based on this subsequent review, recommend that surgery be presented as an option to patients with persistent (&gt;1 year) disabling nonradicular low back pain with discussion of its risks and benefits and with interdisciplinary rehabilitation discussed as similarly effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Shared decision making with regard to surgery should take into account that most patients who undergo surgery will have some residual symptoms.</p><p>A Medicare advisory committee reviewed lumbar fusion surgery in older patients with low back pain related to degenerative disc disease. The report noted flaws in existing studies (poorly defined clinical conditions and outcomes, lack of standardization for control populations, few elderly patients, few randomized studies) and concluded that there was uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of lumbar fusion for older patients with chronic back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A small (n = 41) trial published subsequent to the above reviews differed from previous studies in that it only enrolled patients with chronic low back pain who had single level degenerative disc disease at <span class=\"nowrap\">L4/L5</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">L5/S1,</span> positive provocative discography, and positive response to a local anesthetic disc block. It allocated patients based on a minimization technique to surgery (anterior interbody fusion or posterolateral fusion with screws) versus a minimal exercise intervention (walking and stretching). Like the earlier trial that compared fusion to standard rehabilitation, this trial found that both surgical procedures were associated with lower pain scores and improved function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials that directly compare different fusion techniques are inconsistent and do not permit reliable judgment about comparative benefits. The use of instrumentation is popular with some surgeons. A systematic review found that instrumentation was associated with improved fusion rates without a clear difference in clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) to speed bone fusion significantly increased between 2002 and 2006 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a large database sampling 20 percent of community hospitals in the US, use of bone morphogenetic proteins for spinal fusion was associated with greater hospital costs, a longer hospital stay (3.2 percent increase after multivariable adjustment), but no difference in complication rates for lumbar procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two systematic reviews based on individual patient data each found no clear advantages of lumbar fusion with BMP over iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) in rates of overall success, fusion, or other measures of effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The systematic reviews also found an association between use of BMP and risk of cancer (risk ratio 3.45, 95% CI 1.98-6.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], although rates of cancer were low and the cancers were heterogeneous. Although the reviews found no clear differences in risk of other harms between BMP and ICBG, the rate of harms was high overall and substantially underreported in journal publications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].</p><p>No operative deaths were reported in any of the trials comparing fusion to nonsurgical therapy. A systematic review that included observational data estimated the following complication rates for spinal fusion: in-hospital mortality, 0.2 percent; deep wound infection, 1.5 percent; deep vein thrombosis, 1.6 percent; pulmonary embolus, 2.2 percent; and nerve injury, 2.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. One trial found that more technically difficult procedures were associated with higher rates of complications, but did not result in better overall outcome at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lumbar disc replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial disc replacement is a newer alternative to fusion. A theoretic advantage of lumbar disc replacement compared to fusion is that a prosthetic disc could help preserve normal range of motion and spine mechanics. This could reduce the long-term degenerative changes in adjacent vertebral segments that have been observed following spinal fusion. However, the evidence to date suggests that the efficacy of this approach is similar to that of spinal fusion.</p><p>A 2012 systematic review of seven randomized trials evaluated the use of disc replacement for chronic low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Five trials (n = 1301) specifically compared disc replacement versus fusion for improvement of pain (visual analog score) and function (Oswestry Disability Index) outcomes at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. All studies had risk of bias due to lack of blinding and industry sponsorship. Pooled results demonstrated no significant difference in pain scores between the two groups. There was a statistically, but not clinically, significant difference in improvement in function in the disc replacement group compared to the fusion group (4.3 points, 95% CI 1.9-6.7). </p><p>Only one trial has compared lumbar disc replacement versus a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This study included 173 patients with chronic pain, disability, and L4-5 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> L5-S1 degenerative disc disease. Those randomly assigned to disc replacement had a statistically, but not clinically, significant improvement in disability score (difference of 8 points on a 100 point scale) at two year follow-up, and lower pain scores (difference 12 points on a 100 point scale) compared to the rehabilitation arm. Six patients in the surgery group had complications resulting in physical impairment, with one patient requiring a lower leg amputation following revision surgery. No major complications were reported for the rehabilitation arm.</p><p>A key limitation of existing evidence for the role of lumbar disc replacement is the lack of longer-term follow-up to assess efficacy and failure rates necessitating device removal and potential conversion to a fusion procedure. Regardless of treatment (disc replacement, fusion, or nonsurgical), few patients report complete symptom resolution.</p><p>Disc replacement is approved by the FDA for patients who are in good health, &le;60 years old, with disease limited to one disc between L3 and S1 and no associated deformity, spondylolisthesis, or neurologic deficit. Patients should be treated by surgeons experienced in performing disc replacement, to minimize complications and length of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Guidelines from the American Pain Society found insufficient evidence regarding long-term benefits and harms of disc replacement to support recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Other disc prostheses and nucleus pulposus prostheses are under development, but have not yet been approved by the FDA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LUMBAR DISC PROLAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc prolapse is to relieve symptoms due to inflammation of, or pressure on, affected nerve roots by removing part of, or the entire, disc.</p><p>A variety of discectomy techniques are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The traditional open discectomy is performed with a standard surgical incision, often with the aid of eyepiece (loupe) magnification. It frequently involves a laminectomy (removal of the vertebral lamina to relieve pressure on nerve roots).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microdiscectomy, a refinement of open discectomy, has become the most common procedure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. It involves a smaller incision in the back, with visualization through an operating microscope, followed by a hemilaminectomy (removal of part of the lamina in order to adequately visualize the disc) and removal of the disc fragment compressing the affected nerve or nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally invasive techniques include percutaneous manual nucleotomy, automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy, laser discectomy, endoscopic discectomy, microendoscopic discectomy, coblation nucleoplasty, and the disc DeKompressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Tubular or trochar discectomy is a less invasive technique in which a tubular retractor is inserted over a guidewire, gaining access to the disc by muscle splitting rather than muscle incision and detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>Minimally invasive techniques involve smaller incisions and surgery with the aid of indirect visualization; some techniques employ lasers to vaporize parts of the disc or automated techniques for removing portions of the disc.

The available randomized trials have not been blinded (which can only be accomplished by performing sham surgical procedures) and thus are likely to be influenced by a patient's expectations of treatment results.</p><p>An early trial comparing surgery to nonsurgical therapy for lumbar disc prolapse with nerve root compression found one-year outcome superior for standard open discectomy, with a lower likelihood of poor results (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.99); differences were no longer present after 4 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One-quarter of patients randomized to nonsurgical therapy eventually underwent surgery, making longer-term results difficult to interpret.</p><p>The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trials (SPORT) are multicenter, randomized trials, with associated prospective cohort studies, evaluating surgery versus nonsurgical therapy for three spinal conditions: lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The SPORT trial of surgery for prolapsed lumbar disc found standard open discectomy or microdiscectomy (technique left to discretion of the surgeon) no better than nonoperative treatment for pain relief and improvement in function after three months, in an intention-to-treat analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patients in both groups improved an average of 20 to 30 points (on a 100 point scale) on pain and functional status scores. Results up to four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and eight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] years showed persistent, comparable benefits for surgical and nonoperative treatment in an intention-to-treat analysis for the study primary outcomes of bodily pain, physical function, and disability index. Secondary outcomes (sciatica bothersomeness, self-rated improvement, and patient satisfaction with symptoms) were better for the group assigned to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These results likely underestimate the relative benefit of surgical treatment since about half of patients assigned to either arm crossed over to the other intervention.</p><p>A concurrent prospective cohort study of SPORT patients who met eligibility criteria but declined randomization reported moderate benefits at three months through two years for surgical treatment, compared to nonoperative treatment (10 to 15 points on the 0 to 100 SF-36 bodily pain scale; 12 to 15 points on the 0 to 100 SF-36 physical function scale; 2 to 4 points on the 0 to 24 Sciatica Bothersomeness Index), after adjusting for potential confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

A combined analysis at four and eight years included all patients from the randomized trial and observation cohort who underwent surgery and compared them with patients who had nonsurgical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Patients who had surgery for lumbar disc herniation, compared to those who did not undergo surgery, had greater improvement for all outcomes evaluated (pain, functional status, and disability indices) other than work status.</p><p>An earlier long-term (up to 10 years) cohort study also found early benefits from discectomy that became attenuated with longer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. As with all observational studies, interpretation of these results should take into account the possibility of confounding due to factors contributing to the patients' choice of treatment, expectations from treatment, and perception of symptoms.</p><p>A cost-effectiveness analysis using SPORT data from 775 surgical patients and 416 nonoperative patients (on-treatment analysis of randomized trial and observational cohorts) found that surgery, compared to nonoperative care, resulted in higher costs but better health outcomes at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The cost per QALY gained with surgery ranged from $34,000 to $69,000, depending on imputed surgical costs, and is comparable with other commonly accepted health care interventions. The cost per QALY gained with surgery decreased when reevaluated at four years, indicating increasing value for surgery, compared to nonoperative management with longer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Two randomized trials compared outcomes for early microdiscectomy or initial nonsurgical treatment in patients with lumbar disc herniation and radicular pain lasting 6 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40</a>].

Four trials found no clear differences between standard open discectomy and microdiscectomy in patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally invasive procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive surgical approaches that utilize techniques to further reduce incision size and the area of dissection have been introduced as potential alternatives to standard open discectomy and microdiscectomy. Until more definitive evidence is available showing clear advantages for alternative surgical techniques, our preference is for standard microdiscectomy or open discectomy for patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy who are appropriate surgical candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>A 2014 review of 11 randomized or quasi-randomized trials suggested that compared with open discectomy or microdiscectomy, minimally invasive procedures are associated with less surgical site infections, but they may be inferior for relief of leg and back pain and rehospitalization due to recurrent disc herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The minimally invasive procedures evaluated in the review were percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (eight trials), transmuscular tubular microdiscectomy (two trials), and automated percutaneous discectomy (one trial).</p><p>Other trials have evaluated other minimally invasive procedures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One small (n = 62) trial compared percutaneous disc decompression to conservative therapy (medications, physical therapy, education, counseling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Percutaneous disc decompression was associated with higher pain scores at three months (3.0 versus 0.9 on a 0 to 10 scale), but lower pain scores at year one (1.6 versus 4.0) and at year two (1.7 versus 4.0). Challenges in interpreting this trial are that it used an inadequate randomization method (alternate allocation), and it is unclear why decompression would have a delayed effect, as most trials have shown that benefits of discectomy are most pronounced at short-term follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized but unblinded trial in one center compared standard microdiscectomy and simple fragment excision (microscopic sequestrectomy, a procedure in which disc fragments are removed without entering the disc space itself) in 84 patients with single-level disc herniation and no prior surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Both groups improved substantially immediately following surgery. At two-year follow-up, rates of reherniation between the groups did not differ, while self-reported motor function improved over time for the sequestrectomy group, and worsened for the microdiscectomy group. Longer term outcomes and confirmation of these findings by additional studies are needed before the limited procedure can be routinely recommended.</p><p/><p>There are no published trials comparing other minimally invasive techniques (eg, laser-assisted discectomy) versus open discectomy, microdiscectomy, or nonsurgical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative physiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence that patients need to have activity restricted following first-time lumbar surgery. Although commonly prescribed following surgery, the effectiveness of formal postoperative physiotherapy is uncertain.</p><p>A systematic review, including literature published through 2001, found a lack of high quality studies, and insufficient evidence that physiotherapy immediately following lumbar disc surgery is effective, although it did not cause harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. On the other hand, intensive exercise programs started four to six weeks after surgery were more effective than mild exercise programs for short-term improvement in function and return to work, with no difference in long-term outcomes. The components and intensity of physiotherapy ranged widely in the included trials, and an optimal postoperative rehabilitation regimen could not be identified.</p><p>A single blind randomized study of 120 patients with uncomplicated lumbar disc surgery evaluated a twelve week course of immediate physiotherapy, compared to sham therapy (neck massage) or no therapy; all patients received education on ergonomics, lifestyle changes and back exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Scores for low back pain at twelve weeks were better for physiotherapy than no treatment, but were not significantly different for physiotherapy or sham therapy, suggesting that psychological factors and patient expectations may have influenced outcome. There were no differences between outcomes for any group at long-term (1.5 years) follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SPINAL STENOSIS OR DEGENERATIVE SPONDYLOLISTHESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spondylolisthesis refers to anterior slippage of one vertebral body over another. Degenerative spondylolisthesis, usually caused by degenerative changes at the facet joints and intervertebral discs, is a common cause of spinal stenosis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis leads to a loss of normal structural supports and subluxation of the affected vertebral body, and can cause pain and neurologic deficits due to spinal stenosis or tension on nerve roots. The most common site for degenerative spondylolisthesis is L4.</p><p>Surgery may be beneficial in patients with persistent symptoms related to spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), although the benefit of surgery, compared to nonsurgical therapy, declines over time. Decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion, is the most common surgery for spinal stenosis and symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis. Surgical options and outcomes for spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SPONDYLOLYSIS AND ISTHMIC SPONDYLOLISTHESIS</span></p><p>Spondylolysis refers to a defect in the pars interarticularis (a bone connecting one facet joint to another) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51358 \">figure 1</a>). Spondylolysis is often asymptomatic and detected incidentally as a radiologic finding, although it may also be associated with low back pain. Approximately 90 percent of spondylolysis occurs at L5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. It is seen in about 6 percent of the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], but may be more frequent among adolescent athletes. Symptoms resolve spontaneously in many persons with symptomatic spondylolysis. Treatment is controversial as there are no randomized trials to guide treatment options. Treatment options for symptomatic spondylolysis include bracing, activity restriction, and physical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis'</a>.)</p><p>Isthmic spondylolisthesis differs from degenerative spondylolisthesis in that a lytic defect in the pars interarticularis (lytic spondylolysis) results in anterior subluxation (slippage) of the affected vertebral body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76454 \">figure 2</a>). The subluxation may also place stress on the adjacent intervertebral disc, resulting in degenerative disc disease. The most common site of isthmic spondylolisthesis, L5, can cause back pain or radicular symptoms due to tension or compression on the L5 nerve root. Initial treatment for symptomatic isthmic spondylolisthesis is similar to treatment for spondylolysis. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonsurgical therapies. Potential indications for surgery include progressive slip, development of neurological deficits, and segmental instability associated with pain. Segmental instability is typically diagnosed using a combination of imaging (dynamic slippage with extension or flexion) and clinical findings (frequent exacerbations of back symptoms with minimal provocation). The most common surgical procedure for isthmic spondylolisthesis is posterolateral (transpedicular) fusion, with or without decompressive laminectomy.</p><p>Evidence on efficacy of surgery versus nonsurgical therapy for isthmic spondylolisthesis is limited to one randomized trial (n = 114). In patients with low back pain and sciatica for at least one year, posterolateral fusion was associated with moderately decreased pain (mean score 37 versus 56 on a 0 to 100 scale) and disability (mean Disability Rating Index 29 versus 44 on a 0 to 100 scale) and superior patient-reported overall outcomes (74 versus 43 percent better or much better) after two years compared to an exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

One trial (n = 42) found fusion plus decompressive laminectomy associated with worse outcomes compared to fusion alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], and another (n = 77) found no difference in clinical outcomes between instrumented and non-instrumented fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRACTABLE LOW BACK PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may have persistent disabling low back pain despite use of several standard therapies or following back surgery (ie, failed back surgery syndrome). Though there are no well-proven treatments available for these patients, referral to clinicians experienced in treating intractable back pain should be considered when standard interventions have failed. Evaluation in an interdisciplinary pain clinic may include treatments to control pain, improve function, and provide behavioral support that may not be available in the primary care setting.</p><p>Chronic opioids may be used in such patients to manage pain, but responses are incomplete, long-term outcome unknown, and side effects can be serious. Opioids should only be used after adequate risk assessment and with appropriate monitoring and supervision.

For those with chronic symptoms, few achieve the complete resolution they seek, but rather treatment focuses on controlling pain and improving activity. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not performing surgery for most patients with chronic symptoms attributed to nonspecific low back pain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Decisions regarding surgery should be based on shared decision-making. We suggest that surgery be limited to patients with nonspecific low back pain who meet the following criteria: persistent symptoms with associated disability for at least one year despite nonsurgical interventions; appropriate surgical candidate; and intensive rehabilitation with a cognitive behavioral therapy component is either not available or has not been effective (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for spinal surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Nonspecific low back pain with degenerative disc changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral fusion is the most common surgery for chronic, nonspecific low back pain. Surgical instrumentation (use of pedicle screws or other hardware) increases fusion rates, but it is not known if instrumentation improves clinical outcomes. More research with longer follow-up is needed to determine the appropriate role of artificial disc replacement versus fusion. We suggest that vertebral fusion be performed for patients who undergo surgical intervention for chronic low back pain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Spinal fusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with lumbar disc prolapse and radiculopathy who do not have severe or progressive neurologic deficits, there is no evidence that early referral for surgery improves outcomes. Outcomes for patients who undergo discectomy, compared to nonsurgical therapy, favor surgery at short-term follow-up but are equivalent at one to two years. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar disc prolapse'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally invasive discectomy techniques have not been demonstrated to be superior to traditional discectomy methods and may not be applicable for many patients. For patients with lumbar radicular symptoms of at least 6 to 12 weeks who are good surgical candidates and desire surgery based on shared decision-making, we suggest either open discectomy or microdiscectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Earlier surgery may be indicated for patients with severe and disabling pain related to lumbar disc prolapse that is unresponsive to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar disc prolapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery may be beneficial in patients with persistent symptoms related to spinal stenosis. For patients who undergo laminectomy compared to nonsurgical therapy, outcomes favor surgery at short-term follow-up but not at longer follow-up.

However, benefits do not persist with longer follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intractable back pain, who are not surgical candidates or in whom surgery has not been successful, should be referred to chronic pain specialists, preferably in the setting of an interdisciplinary pain clinic. For patients with persistent disabling radicular pain following surgery, and following shared decision-making that includes a specific discussion regarding the relatively high rate of device-related complications, we suggest spinal cord stimulation as an option (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
