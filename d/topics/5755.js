This poor prognosis is due, in large part, to the fact that most women are diagnosed at an advanced stage, while early stages of the disease are potentially curable. Unfortunately, attempts to develop screening programs for epithelial ovarian cancer using pelvic imaging or tumor markers have not yet been successful. The identification of epithelial ovarian cancer symptoms to aid early detection has become a focus of clinical research.</p><p>Epithelial carcinoma of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum are clinically similar. Evidence suggests that these diseases have a common pathogenesis, and may be initiated in the fallopian tubes. The term ovarian cancer will be used in this topic to refer to disease of any of these three sites. </p><p>Early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer through symptoms recognition is reviewed here. Screening and diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8563428\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE REGARDING EARLY SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8563498\"><span class=\"h2\">Presence of early symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, epithelial ovarian cancer was called the &quot;silent killer&quot; because symptoms were not thought to occur until very late in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer typically presents with abdominal distention, nausea, anorexia, or early satiety due to the presence of ascites and omental or bowel metastases; dyspnea is occasionally present due to a pleural effusion. However, studies have found that symptoms occur in many women even at early stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. </p><p>Most women with epithelial ovarian cancer have pelvic or abdominal symptoms prior to their diagnosis. This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis that included 21 mostly retrospective studies (one study was prospective) of women with epithelial ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The proportion of women report symptoms differed by study design (7 percent were asymptomatic by patient interview or questionnaire; 23 percent according to medical records). This difference is likely due to recall bias in the patient report studies.</p><p>The symptoms that were most commonly reported by at least half of study subjects were: abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/discomfort</span> and abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">swelling/bloating</span>. These symptoms may be attributed to many different conditions. It appears, though, that they are more common, recur more frequently, and are more severe in women prior to a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer than in other women.</p><p>The rate of symptoms in women with epithelial ovarian cancer compared with other women was illustrated in three case control studies included in the meta-analysis. As an example, one study surveyed 128 women with pelvic masses prior to undergoing surgery (44 were ultimately diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer) and 1011 of whom presented to a primary care clinic for a problem visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Women with epithelial ovarian cancer had a significantly higher rate of the following symptoms compared with those with benign masses and with the primary care patients, respectively: increased abdominal size (64 versus 56 and 19 percent); bloating (70 versus 49 and 38 percent); and urinary tract symptoms (particularly urgency) (55 versus 31 and 32 percent). Pelvic pain, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, difficulty eating, and constipation were significantly more common in women with epithelial ovarian cancer than in primary care patients, but not in those with pelvic masses.</p><p>The pattern and quality of symptoms appears to differ among patient with cancer. In the meta-analysis, compared with primary care patients, symptoms in women with epithelial ovarian cancer recurred more frequently (20 to 30 times versus 2 to 3 times per month), were more severe, and had a shorter duration (less than three to six months versus one year or more) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, epithelial ovarian cancer patients were more likely to have multiple symptoms (a triad of bloating, increased abdominal size, and urinary urgency was present in 44 versus 8 percent).</p><p>The increased likelihood of symptoms in women with epithelial ovarian cancer was further supported by a study that compared Medicare claims linked to the California Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer database for 1985 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, 6024 women with breast cancer, and over 10,000 women without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Epithelial ovarian cancer patients were significantly more likely to have health care visits for abdominal swelling and gastrointestinal symptoms in the six months prior to diagnosis than age-matched breast cancer and non-cancer controls.</p><p>The duration of the onset of symptoms to time of diagnosis of ovarian cancer varies. A study of 1700 women with ovarian cancer reported that 30 percent of women had symptoms for 0 to 2 months, 35 percent for 3 to 6 months, 20 percent for 7 to 12 months, and 15 percent for greater than 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women who felt that they had ignored their symptoms were more frequently found to have advanced stage disease; however, this question may be influenced by recall bias.</p><p>Use of symptom recognition may have the potential to identify women with early stage disease. Women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer appear to have symptoms, but less frequently than those with late stage cancer (89 versus 97 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether recognition of epithelial ovarian cancer symptoms results in earlier diagnosis, and ultimately, in improved prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of early detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each year approximately 21,990 women in the United States are diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer and an estimated 15,460 women die of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The goal of early detection is to reduce epithelial ovarian cancer mortality by diagnosing the disease while it is confined to the ovary, when the five-year survival rate is 80 to 90 percent. Unfortunately, almost 80 percent of women have lymph node or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis; five-year survival rates fall to 19 to 32 percent for advanced disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64569 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A secondary goal is detection and treatment of advanced disease as early as possible. Cure rates are two-fold for women in whom optimal cytoreduction (less than 1 cm of gross residual disease following surgery) can be achieved compared with those who do not have an optimal surgery (30 to 40 percent cure versus 15 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most significant factor associated with optimal cytoreduction is the volume of disease at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some evidence suggests that evaluation of ovarian cancer symptoms results in identification of more women with completely resectable disease. The highest quality data regarding this are from the pilot phase of the Diagnosing Ovarian Cancer Early (DOvE) study, a prospective study in which 1455 women age 50 or older with symptoms associated with ovarian cancer were evaluated with serum CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At 7-month follow-up, 239 women (16 percent) had an initial abnormal test result and underwent further evaluation and 11 women (0.8 percent) were diagnosed with invasive ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancers. Only one patient who underwent exploratory surgery was found to have benign rather than malignant disease. Among the women with ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer, 8 (72 percent) were completely resectable compared with 23 percent in a control group of women with ovarian cancer who presented during the study period to gynecologic oncologists at the same institution. </p><p>Historically, epithelial ovarian cancer was called the &quot;silent killer&quot; because symptoms were not thought to occur until very late in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer typically presents with abdominal distention, nausea, anorexia, or early satiety due to the presence of ascites and omental or bowel metastases; dyspnea is occasionally present due to a pleural effusion. However, studies have found that symptoms occur in many women even at early stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. For this reason, early identification of symptomatic women has become a goal of the current approach to this disease.</p><p>It is hypothesized that if an association between specific patterns of symptoms and epithelial ovarian cancer can be identified, earlier detection of disease may be possible. At issue is whether diagnosing epithelial ovarian cancer three to six months earlier will improve prognosis. The potential impact of early detection depends upon how much time it takes to progress from disease confined to the ovary or fallopian tube to metastatic disease as well as how quickly metastases increase in volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H26443084\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Fallopian tubal carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>There are no definitive data regarding the doubling time for ovarian cancer. In one study, the average time to develop port site metastasis after laparoscopy in ovarian cancer was 17 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A modelling study calculated that ovarian tumors may spend more than four years as stage I or II and one year as stage III or IV until they become clinically apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In recurrent ovarian cancer, the median doubling time of CA 125 (a surrogate for volume of disease) is 40 days but the range of doubling times is very wide and prognosis was significantly worse in those with quick doubling times compared with those with long doubling times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Symptoms that are associated with epithelial ovarian cancer are often nongynecologic and, frequently, nonspecific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78148 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Patients and providers may not consider the possibility of epithelial ovarian cancer when these symptoms arise. Thus, another important clinical challenge is to identify which symptoms warrant further evaluation for epithelial ovarian cancer, without resulting in large-scale unnecessary testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH TO SYMPTOM RECOGNITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion reviews our clinical approach to early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer through symptom recognition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk assessment for ovarian cancer depends upon age and family history. It is probably most effective to focus attention on symptoms in women who are at an increased risk (ie, over 40 years old or with a family history of ovarian or related cancer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H6092142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Women may present with symptoms suggestive of epithelial ovarian cancer or such symptoms can be elicited during a routine review of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary urgency or frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty eating or feeling full</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal or pelvic pain</p><p/><p>Women who complain of these symptoms should be further evaluated with a thorough history to assess for other potential symptoms of epithelial ovarian cancer and to gain additional information about each symptom (eg, frequency, severity). Symptoms that are of new onset, coexist with other symptoms, occur almost daily, and are more severe than expected warrant further evaluation. For example, persistent rather than fluctuating abdominal distension was associated with epithelial ovarian cancer in one small observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A population-based study in the United Kingdom found that a clinical algorithm was able to predict the risk of a diagnosis of ovarian cancer within two years based upon family history of ovarian cancer or a set of symptoms (eg, abdominal distension, abdominal pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the two-year study period, 63 percent of the ovarian cancers were diagnosed among the 10 percent of women with the highest predicted risk. The top predictive factors were: abdominal distention, family history of ovarian cancer, postmenopausal bleeding, and appetite loss. This algorithm is not available for clinical use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptom index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A symptom index has been developed to aid clinicians in evaluating women for early symptoms of epithelial ovarian cancer. Further validation studies are needed for this index and it is not yet recommended for routine clinical use. The symptom index is considered to be positive if a woman reports any of the following symptoms that are: (1) new to her within the past year and (2) occur more than 12 times per month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic or abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased abdominal size or abdominal bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly</p><p/><p>Follow-up for a positive index include the standard steps used to evaluate a woman with suspected epithelial ovarian cancer: assessment of risk factors, pelvic imaging, serum CA 125 concentration, and possible referral to a gynecologic oncologist. Decisions regarding surgical exploration should not be made based upon a positive symptom index alone. </p><p>The initial study to develop the epithelial ovarian cancer symptom index was a case control study in which 149 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, 255 women enrolled in an epithelial ovarian cancer screening program, and 233 women referred for <span class=\"nowrap\">pelvic/abdominal</span> ultrasound were surveyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The cases and controls were divided randomly into two groups, and in the initial phase of the study, the symptom index was developed by evaluating the cases and controls in one group. <span class=\"nowrap\">Pelvic/abdominal</span> pain, increased abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">size/bloating,</span> and difficulty <span class=\"nowrap\">eating/feeling</span> full were the symptoms that were most significantly associated with epithelial ovarian cancer when they were present for less than one year and occurred for more than 12 days per month. These results were then used as the reference standard to determine the performance of the index in the other part of sample. By disease stage, sensitivity of the index for early stage was 57 and for late stage was 80 percent. According to patient age, sensitivity and specificity for women &lt;50 years were both 87 percent and for women &ge;50 years were 67 and 90 percent.</p><p>Since the prevalence of epithelial ovarian cancer is low, the utility of the symptom index in an average risk population has been questioned. A case control study compared 812 women with epithelial ovarian cancer with 1313 women from the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Sensitivity for epithelial ovarian cancer in stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> was 62 percent and for stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> was 70 percent; the specificity was 95 percent for all stages. For different age groups, the sensitivity and specificity for ages 55 to 74 were 66 and 96 percent and for ages 35 to 54 were 69 and 94 percent. Using this average risk study population for comparison, the positive predictive value of the symptom index was 0.8 to 1.1 percent for all ovarian cancers and 0.2 to 0.5 for stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease. From a clinical perspective, the symptom index is best utilized when it is the first step in a sequential process that includes measurement of CA 125 and ultrasound imaging for women with a positive symptom index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Combined use of CA 125 and the symptoms index for epithelial ovarian cancer may have better diagnostic performance than either test alone. In a prospective study, 75 patients with pelvic masses who were subsequently diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer and 254 high risk controls were evaluated with the symptom index and a serum CA 125 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The symptom index had lower sensitivity and specificity for epithelial ovarian cancer than an abnormal CA 125 (64 and 88 versus 79 and 95 percent); 11 percent of women with ovarian cancer had a positive symptom index and negative CA 125 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The combination of either a positive CA 125 or symptom index had a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity than either test alone (89 and 84 percent). The combination of these tests needs to be evaluated in an average risk population.</p><p>Many media sources and survivor groups have suggested that women keep symptom diaries and report them to physicians, but the safety of this approach has not been evaluated and there are concerns that a systematic focus on symptoms could lead to unnecessary surgery. A pilot study of over 1200 women who were screened with a symptom index followed by reflexive CA 125 and TVS in symptom index positive patients resulted in no major (laparoscopy or laparotomy) unindicated procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with symptoms suggestive of epithelial ovarian cancer should be evaluated with a physical examination, including an abdominal, pelvic, and rectovaginal examination as well as palpation of groin and supraclavicular lymph nodes.

This tumor marker used alone does not perform well for diagnosis or exclusion of epithelial ovarian cancer in premenopausal women. Moreover, half of patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer have a normal CA 125 level. Nevertheless, a very high level is suggestive of epithelial ovarian cancer and a baseline value is useful in monitoring women who are subsequently diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Role of early detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women with epithelial ovarian cancer have abdominal symptoms prior to their diagnosis. These symptoms are often gastrointestinal or urinary, rather than gynecologic. (See <a href=\"#H8563498\" class=\"local\">'Presence of early symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating, increased abdominal size, urinary urgency or frequency, difficulty eating or feeling full, and abdominal or pelvic pain occur in many gastrointestinal disorders, but are also common in women with epithelial ovarian cancer. In particular, epithelial ovarian cancer should be suspected when these symptoms coexist with other symptoms, occur almost daily, and are more severe than expected. (See <a href=\"#H8563498\" class=\"local\">'Presence of early symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A symptom index has been developed to aid clinicians in evaluating women for early symptoms of epithelial ovarian cancer. Further validation studies are needed for this index and it is not yet recommended for routine clinical use. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Symptom index'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest physical examination, pelvic ultrasound examination, and measurement of serum CA 125 for further evaluation of women with persistent symptoms that are suggestive of epithelial ovarian cancer. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and imaging studies'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Siegel R, Ward E, Brawley O, Jemal A.
