The pain can be continuous or episodic. MPPS can impact urinary, bowel, and sexual function. As pelvic pain is a common reason for women to seek health care and many women with chronic pelvic pain have some degree of MPPS, clinicians need to include this syndrome in the differential when evaluating women with pelvic pain.</p><p>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MPPS in women are reviewed here.

MPPS is thought to originate at the trigger point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2319527489\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigger points</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigger points, the hallmark of myofascial pain, are hyperirritable, palpable nodules that are painful to compression and produce sensory, motor, and, rarely, autonomic symptoms (eg, coldness, sweating, tachycardia, coryza, lacrimation, and erythema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Trigger points can be active (ie, spontaneously painful) or latent (ie, painful only with stimulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A local twitch response occurs when firm pressure is applied (strummed) across the point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, the twitch response is not always palpable, especially in the pelvic floor. Trigger points in the pelvic floor often refer pain to the vagina, vulva, perineum, rectum, and bladder, as well as to more distant areas such as the thighs, buttocks, or lower abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. At distant sites, irritative symptoms can be more prominent than pain. Irritative symptoms include urinary urgency, frequency, vulvar or vaginal burning, itching, or dysuria, alone or in combination. When these symptoms occur in the absence of objective findings (eg, positive cultures), myofascial pain should be added to the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252992519\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of MPPS in the general population is not known. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome, of which MPPS is one cause, affects 14 to 25 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In one retrospective study of over 1100 women referred for evaluation of chronic pelvic pain, 13 percent were diagnosed with MPPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Theories for the etiology of myofascial pain include neuromuscular microtrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], metabolic imbalance in the peripheral tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>], and centralization of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. These processes likely work in combination. Acute trauma or repetitive microtraumas can cause high-intensity stimulation of the motor end plates of the pelvic floor muscles, which in turn may result in chronic muscle contraction (hypertonus) and formation of trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Metabolic imbalance, consisting of elevated levels of pain-producing compounds, has been demonstrated in the vicinity of active trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>]. Centralization of pain occurs when the sensory pain information is abnormally processed in the central nervous system (ie, central sensitization) and appears to result in pain that is then perpetuated by the central nervous system, also known as a dysfunctional pain syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>].</p><p>The pelvic floor is believed to be at risk of developing hypertonus, myofascial trigger points, and pain because pelvic floor muscles (1) are involved in several different kinds of activities, including musculoskeletal support of the upper body and lower extremities, and control of bladder, bowel, and sexual function; (2) must elongate and contract eccentrically; and (3) are affected by physiologic and psychologic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Over time, muscles with trigger points become weak, tender, and shortened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Dysfunction of one muscle can then cause surrounding muscle groups, including muscles of the buttocks, thighs, and abdomen, to contract and develop trigger points, thereby worsening myofascial pain and related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252991762\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to other pelvic pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic floor muscle hypertonus and MPPS have been associated with other pain processes including painful bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis, provoked vestibulodynia, generalized vulvodynia, endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>]. Central sensitization of pain has been demonstrated in all these syndromes and therefore provides one possible explanation for the coexistence of multiple pain syndromes in the same woman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/21,26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26,28,29</a>].</p><p>Additionally, there is a correlation between visceral inflammation and myofascial abnormalities in tissues that share the same innervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because of the proximity in the spinal cord between the afferent nerve endings of deep muscles of the pelvic floor and the parasympathetic nerves of the bladder, the bladder can be negatively impacted by pelvic floor contraction and trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This nerve proximity could explain why women with painful bladder syndrome often have a high tone, or contracted, pelvic floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

One purpose of the history is to identify other possible pain etiologies, such as endometriosis. Deep muscular pain and visceral pain can be difficult, if not impossible, for most patients to differentiate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

We ask women which positions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activities (including prolonged sitting, intercourse, and exercise) worsen or improve their symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of pelvic infection &ndash; We ask whether the patient has had laboratory-proven urinary tract, vaginal, or pelvic infections. MPPS can be a sequelae of infection and inflammation, as demonstrated in patients with herpes zoster infections and men with prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Additionally, women can report the sensation of a urinary tract infection or vaginitis after MPPS flares, but tests are consistently negative. Because these symptoms can be erroneously diagnosed as an infectious etiology, we ask women if they have previously been diagnosed with pelvic infections (urine, vagina, or cervix) that were not confirmed upon testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact of menstrual cycle &ndash; MPPS symptoms do not generally change during menses, although, in some women, menses exacerbates the pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referred pain &ndash; MPPS often mimics visceral pain in that it can be poorly localized and referred to a distant cutaneous site, which can also be tender. Conversely, the woman can note that skin compression, such as by clothing or position, causes deep visceral discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of pain at other locations &ndash; Women with MPPS frequently have pain in other muscles of the pelvic girdle, including back and hips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81019 \">figure 1</a>). Additionally, MPPS is associated with other pelvic pain syndromes, including painful bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis and vulvodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>].

As an example, a woman who undergoes laparoscopic evaluation for chronic pelvic pain can have postoperative worsening of her myofascial symptoms. The cause is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of trauma &ndash; MPPS can result from pelvic trauma such as surgery, injuries to the back or hip, or childbirth. We specifically inquire about recent falls or injuries as women often do not equate musculoskeletal issues with their pelvic floor symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40669906\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination for MPPS includes an external examination of the trunk muscles and connective tissue, a pelvic examination with assessment of the pelvic floor musculature, and assessment of the patient's gait and motor strength. There is little correlation between any single presenting symptom and physical findings in women with MPPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Having the patient indicate the site of pain helps to direct the examination; this area is examined last to minimize the effects of voluntary guarding.</p><p>Palpation is the main method for clinical assessment of pelvic floor hypertonus and trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Skeletal muscles are palpated for a tight band of tissue (hypertonus) or nodule (trigger point) that produces local pain, a twitch response, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referred pain to the pelvic organs or surrounding tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Studies support that palpation is reliable when performed by a skilled examiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. Most women with MPPS have pelvic floor trigger points that are exquisitely tender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a series of 49 women with MPPS, 92 percent had trigger points in the levator ani muscles. Other commonly affected muscle groups included the rectus (65 percent), iliopsoas (43 percent), obturator internus (45 percent), and piriformis (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The variation in trigger point location may account for the diversity of presenting symptoms among women with MPPS.</p><p>We take the following approach to the physical examination in women suspected of having MPPS:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641452491\"><span class=\"h3\">External examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform an external examination that includes visual inspection and palpation of the abdomen, hips, low back, buttocks, and thighs. We also examine any other areas of concern to the patient. We assess for areas of tenderness, referred pain, and trigger points. (See <a href=\"#H2319527489\" class=\"local\">'Trigger points'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Examine the rectus abdominis for tenderness, trigger points, referred pain, and diastasis recti. Women with MPPS often have diffuse tenderness in the abdomen, particularly over the rectus abdominis and external oblique muscle groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess the connective tissues by rolling the skin lightly between two fingers (not pinching); tender areas often feel thickened or tight and will elicit sharp pain or a deep &quot;bruise-like&quot; pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apply pressure over the suprapubic area to see if pain is elicited, especially as the bladder is compressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Manipulate any surgical scars. Scars should move easily and without restrictions; scars that are puckered, have limited movement, or are tender could be a source of MPPS or exacerbate symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1656648090\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a standard pelvic examination that also includes assessment of pelvic floor motion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;, section on 'Pelvic examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Observe the external genitalia as the woman bears down and also as she contracts the pelvic floor. Women with MPPS often have weak pelvic floor muscles that have limited mobility, move paradoxically, and relax slowly or incompletely. If the woman has difficulty contracting her pelvic floor, ask her to squeeze the vaginal muscles around the examiner's single digit or try to &quot;pick up a dime&quot; with the vaginal muscles. As the pelvic floor contracts and relaxes, look for asymmetry, incomplete contraction or relaxation, limited mobility, and paradoxical contraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provoke an anal wink reflex by gently stroking the skin immediately surrounding the anus; this results in a reflexive contraction of the external anal sphincter. For women with MPPS, the reflex can be absent because the pelvic floor muscles are already contracted. However, the absence of this reflex can also be due to nerve damage and interruption of the spinal arc. Thus, an absent anal wink contributes to the diagnosis but is not definitive. In addition, many asymptomatic women have an absent anal wink.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perform a speculum examination and assess for signs of hypoestrogenism or infection. Both hypoestrogenism and vaginal infections can cause pain as well as trigger or exacerbate MPPS. Pain from MPPS will not resolve after treatment for vaginal atrophy or infection.

The uterus, bladder, and adnexa are palpated to determine if other pathology, such as fibroids or ovarian cysts, are present. MPPS and other pelvic pathology may coexist. However, identifying another possible cause for the pelvic symptoms does not exclude MPPS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;, section on 'Bimanual examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2838480584\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic floor musculature examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a detailed assessment of the pelvic floor musculature with focus on identifying areas of hypertonic muscle bands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trigger points. Trigger points can often be localized in areas of tight or bandy muscles, which can feel like violin strings; these areas can be exquisitely tender with even light palpation. Pain is usually associated with involuntary spasm of the pelvic floor muscles (eg, bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, transversus perineum, sphincter ani, piriformis, levator ani, or obturator internus, alone or in any combination) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67298 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82007 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51329 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Prior to examination, we inform women that some patients report worsened pain following the muscle examination. We counsel women that persistent or worsened pain confirms their diagnosis, can last for several hours, and typically resolves with time. In the examination, we do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apply pressure to the woman's thigh as a baseline reference of how much pressure to expect during the exam (enough pressure to blanch the examiner's fingernail). For the rest of the examination, proceed slowly and gently and ask the woman to indicate if she has discomfort at any point. We ask her to rate her pain on a scale of zero (feels pressure, but no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perform a vaginal examination and apply pressure to the obturator internus, located laterally and deep to the vaginal opening. Asking the patient to abduct the knee against resistance while the hip is flexed will make this area easier to palpate. Next we sweep the fingers medially to locate the iliococcygeus, noting any areas of tenderness, tension, or banding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess the deep pelvic muscles on vaginal examination. In particular, the levator ani muscle group can develop hypertonus, myalgia, overuse, and fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82007 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51329 \">figure 4</a>). We do not examine all deep pelvic muscles but instead assess one or two groups on each side. If there is severe pain elicited on palpation of one muscle group, we do not continue the examination on the painful side. Instead, we examine the same muscle group on the other side of the pelvis, to assess symmetry of pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess the urethral sphincter and pubococcygeus in the vagina by gently compressing these areas between your finger and the pubic symphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82007 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51329 \">figure 4</a>). If this area is involved, the patient will often note a feeling of urinary urgency or tenderness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess the puborectalis (medial portion of pubococcygeus) with either the vaginal or rectal examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51329 \">figure 4</a>).

Muscles with trigger points are already in a state of contraction or spasm and therefore do not have full range of motion. Muscle strength is compromised due to inability to fully contract. We refer all patients with symptoms and findings of short, tender muscles to a physical therapist specialized in treating disorders of the pelvic floor. The referral is not urgent unless pain is severe. The therapist assesses the patient for posture, gait, range of motion of the trunk and hips, pelvic instability, and lower extremity strength, mobility, and length as well as assessing the pelvic muscles. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While waiting for the physical therapy evaluation, we offer patients comfort measures consisting of stretching, self-massage, heat or ice (whichever feels better), and oral analgesics.

Thus most women with pelvic pain undergo transvaginal ultrasound to assess for visceral pathology. More data are needed on the role of modalities such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of MPPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-47</a>].

The diagnosis of MPPS is supported by a history of prior trauma or test-confirmed infection, as well as by a history of infection-like symptoms despite negative laboratory tests.</p><p>A clinician does not need to feel the actual trigger point or muscle quivering to make a diagnosis of MPPS. The finding of tender muscles and hypersensitive tissues confirms this diagnosis. The presence of other pelvic abnormalities (eg, fibroids or ovarian cyst) at the time of physical examination does not exclude the diagnosis of MPPS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of MPPS includes many potential causes of acute and chronic pelvic pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56612\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56612 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112656 \">table 2</a>).

Similar to the pain of MPPS, abdominal myofascial pain is easily confused with pain of a visceral origin. Abdominal myofascial pain can usually be identified by having the patient Valsalva (by performing a half sit-up from the supine position), which tightens the rectus muscles. If tenderness is worsened with palpation of the abdominal wall during Valsalva, the patient's pain is likely originating from the abdominal musculature. If the abdominal wall contraction lessens the pain, the pain is more likely visceral in origin.

Coccygodynia, pelvic floor tension myalgia, piriformis syndrome, levator ani spasm syndrome, and proctalgia fugax share hypertonicity of regions of the pelvic musculature as an underlying problem, and may represent various manifestations of the same disease state. These syndromes are differentiated from MPPS by their specific anatomic location. However, it can be impossible to attribute specific symptoms to distinct muscle groups. Typically, the same muscle groups are involved in differing degrees in women presenting with other myofascial pelvic pain syndromes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromyalgia &ndash; Fibromyalgia is a collection of symptoms including widespread pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 5</a>), accompanied by tactile allodynia, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and psychological distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Fibromyalgia differs from MPPS in that patients with fibromyalgia have pain throughout their bodies, have other somatic symptoms, have symptoms for at least three months duration, and generally do not have trigger points. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous allodynia &ndash; Allodynia is pain in response to a non-nociceptive (ie, non-painful) stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Cutaneous allodynia is relatively common among women with chronic pelvic pain.

It is differentiated from MPPS by symptoms that are usually related to the menstrual cycle and possibly by findings suggestive of endometriosis on imaging, such as complex ovarian cysts. Endometriosis is definitively diagnosed by tissue biopsy. Endometriosis often co-occurs with MPPS. Women with endometriosis-related pelvic pain have also been shown to have signs of sensitization and myofascial dysfunction, particularly in the abdomino-pelvic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. It is not known if the two disorders share a common pain mechanism or if endometriosis leads to MPPS.

Trigger points can be active (ie, spontaneously painful) or latent (ie, painful only with stimulation). Pelvic trigger points often refer pain to the vagina, vulva, perineum, rectum, and bladder, as well as to more distant areas such as the thighs, buttocks, or lower abdomen.
