Abnormalities in any of the above steps can result in hyperbilirubinemia in which there is either an elevation in unconjugated bilirubin alone or of both unconjugated (indirect) and conjugated (direct) bilirubin. Complex clinical disorders such as hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect multiple processes, resulting in the accumulation of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. In these settings, the proportion of conjugated bilirubin in plasma increases. By contrast, the unconjugated fraction alone is increased when there is bilirubin overproduction (as with hemolysis) without liver disease or in the setting of inherited or acquired disorders that impair bilirubin uptake or glucuronidation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are bilirubin overproduction, Gilbert syndrome, and neonatal jaundice. This topic will review the first two disorders with an emphasis on Gilbert syndrome. Crigler-Najjar syndromes type I and II (rare inherited diseases associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia), neonatal jaundice, and the evaluation of patients with jaundice are discussed separately.

Transient elevation of the unconjugated form of bilirubin can also occur during absorption of large hematomas. The breakdown of hemoglobin results in the production of bilirubin. In order to be excreted in bile, bilirubin needs to be made water soluble, which is achieved by conjugating it to glucuronic acid. In the setting of bilirubin overproduction, the liver&rsquo;s ability to conjugate the bilirubin is overwhelmed, leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bilirubin-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bilirubin metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of hemolysis, the plasma bilirubin concentration rarely exceeds 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Although a small amount of conjugated bilirubin can accumulate in the serum, the proportion of the conjugated form stays within the normal limits (about 4 percent of total bilirubin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Of note, the laboratory techniques used to determine the &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; fractions of bilirubin overestimate the true proportion of conjugated bilirubin.

Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition that has also been called &quot;constitutional hepatic dysfunction&quot; and &quot;familial nonhemolytic jaundice&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although many patients present as isolated cases, the condition can also run in families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of jaundice and may be triggered by, among other things, dehydration, fasting, intercurrent disease, menstruation, and overexertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other than jaundice, patients are typically asymptomatic. The hyperbilirubinemia in patients with Gilbert syndrome is unconjugated. The diagnosis is made by excluding other causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, though genetic testing is available. No treatment is necessary, though it may be a risk factor for toxicity from some medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78565074\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of Gilbert syndrome has been reported to be between 4 and 16 percent in different populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>]. Patients typically present during adolescence when alterations in sex steroid concentrations affect bilirubin metabolism, leading to increased plasma bilirubin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As a result, it is rarely diagnosed prior to puberty. The disorder is more commonly diagnosed in males, possibly due to a relatively higher level of daily bilirubin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gilbert syndrome is the result of a defect in the promotor of the gene that encodes the enzyme uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61357088\"><span class=\"h3\">Impaired bilirubin glucuronidation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uridine diphosphoglucuronate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are a family of enzymes that mediate glucuronidation of various endogenous and exogenous compounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52393 \">figure 1</a>). Bilirubin-UGT (<em>UGT1A1</em>) conjugates bilirubin to glucuronic acid, converting the bilirubin into a water-soluble form that is readily excreted in bile. Patients with Gilbert syndrome have a mutation in <em>UGT1A1</em>, the gene that encodes bilirubin-UGT.

A similar rise in bilirubin occurs in patients with Gilbert syndrome who receive a normocaloric diet without lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The bilirubin concentration returns to baseline within 12 to 24 hours after resuming a normal diet.<br/><br/>The cause of hyperbilirubinemia during fasting is probably multifactorial. Several causes have been hypothesized to contribute, including an increased bilirubin load due to the release of bilirubin contained within adipocytes, decreased conjugation due to depletion of UDP-glycuronic acid (which serves as a cosubstrate in glucuronidation), and enhanced cycling of bilirubin by the enterohepatic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>Intercurrent febrile illnesses, physical exertion, and stress probably cause hyperbilirubinemia by the same mechanisms as fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61355743\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic defect in patients with Gilbert syndrome involves the promotor region of <em>UGT1A1</em>. Gilbert syndrome manifests only in people who are homozygous for the variant promoter. As a result, its inheritance is most consistent with an autosomal recessive trait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80818 \">table 2</a>). However, heterozygotes for the Gilbert genotype have higher average plasma bilirubin concentrations compared with those with two wild-type alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is estimated that 9 percent of individuals of the general population in the Western world are homozygous for the variant promoter, and up to 42 percent are heterozygous.</p><p>Characterization of the <em>UGT1A</em> gene locus has permitted an understanding of the molecular defects responsible for Gilbert syndrome. The mutation responsible for Gilbert syndrome is in the promoter region, upstream to exon 1 of <em>UGT1A1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The normal sequence of the TATAA element within the promoter is A[TA]6TAA. Caucasian and black patients with Gilbert syndrome are homozygous for a longer version of the TATAA sequence, A[TA]7TAA, which causes reduced production of bilirubin-UGT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73505 \">figure 2</a>). This variant is termed <em>UGT1A1*28</em>. The defect in Gilbert syndrome is different from that in the Crigler-Najjar syndromes, in which bilirubin-UGT is either absent or produced in an abnormal form with reduced or no activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crigler-najjar-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crigler-Najjar syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The longer TATAA element has been found in all subjects with Gilbert syndrome studied in the United States, Europe, and countries of the Middle East and South Asia. However, other factors are probably involved in the expression of the Gilbert phenotype since not all patients who are homozygous for the variant promoter develop hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, in the Japanese population, other mutations within the coding regions of <em>UGT1A1</em> can cause the Gilbert phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Because of the high frequency of the Gilbert type promoter, some heterozygous carriers of structural mutations that cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome type also carry the Gilbert type of TATAA element on their normal allele. Such combined defects can lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia, occasionally causing kernicterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gilbert-syndrome-and-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-due-to-bilirubin-overproduction/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This also explains the frequent finding of intermediate levels of hyperbilirubinemia in the family members of patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome.

The breakdown of hemoglobin results in the production of bilirubin. In order to be excreted in bile, bilirubin needs to be made water soluble, which is achieved by conjugating it to glucuronic acid.
