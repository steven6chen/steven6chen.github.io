Both parasites are hermaphroditic, have similar life cycles, and cause similar clinical manifestations in humans. The organism causes &quot;liver rot&quot; among sheep and cattle, which are the definitive hosts; humans are incidental hosts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FASCIOLA HEPATICA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>F. hepatica</em> occurs globally, mainly in sheep-rearing areas of temperate climates. Infection is endemic in Central and South America (especially Bolivia and Peru), Europe (especially Portugal, France, Spain, and Turkey), Asia (especially China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea, and Thailand), Africa, and the Middle East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sporadic cases have also been reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An estimated 2.4 to 17 million people are infected in more than 51 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; 91 million are at risk worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Sheep and cattle are the most important definitive hosts of <em>F. hepatica</em>; goats, buffalo, horses, camels, hogs, deer, and rabbits can also be infected. Snails are intermediate hosts. Humans are incidental hosts and most often acquire infection by eating watercress grown in sheep-raising areas. Infection may also be transmitted by other freshwater plants, including water lettuce, mint, alfalfa, and parsley. Humans can also acquire infection by drinking contaminated water containing viable metacercariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; outbreaks have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of animal and human infection rises during wet years because of an increased number of snails and longer survival of encysted cercariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In some areas, endemicity is almost 100 percent. In endemic regions, very young children and women are most likely to be infected. There is a high incidence of coinfection with other parasites, especially echinococcosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The life cycle of fascioliasis begins with release of un-embryonated eggs into the biliary ducts, which are then passed in the stool of herbivores (definitive hosts) or humans (incidental hosts) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50779 \">figure 1</a>). Eggs become embryonated in water and release miracidia, which invade a snail (intermediate host), where the parasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts, rediae, and cercariae). The cercariae are released and encyst as metacercariae on aquatic vegetation.</p><p>Sheep, cattle, or humans acquire infection by eating vegetation containing metacercariae. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and migrate through the intestinal wall, peritoneal cavity, and liver parenchyma into the biliary ducts, where they develop into adults; in humans, this takes three to four months. The adult flukes reside in the large biliary ducts of the mammalian host.</p><p>Migrating metacercariae cause liver parenchymal destruction, since tracks undergo necrosis and fibrosis. In addition, adult flukes can partially obstruct the bile ducts, causing thickening, dilatation, and fibrosis of the proximal biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The amount of liver damage is correlated with the parasite load; the number of adult flukes that reach the biliary tree and develop to sexual maturity is usually small. The life span of adult <em>F. hepatica</em> flukes within humans is estimated to be 9 to 13 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many infections are mild; morbidity increases with fluke burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Forms of infection include the acute (liver) phase, chronic (biliary) phase, ectopic fascioliasis, and pharyngeal fascioliasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute (liver) phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute symptoms usually begin within 6 to 12 weeks of metacercariae ingestion. The early phase of migration through the liver is often associated with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and hepatomegaly. Jaundice is occasionally observed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55607 \">table 1</a>). Other symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, cough, and urticaria. Marked peripheral eosinophilia is almost always present. The acute phase can be complicated by hemobilia or subcapsular hematomas of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In most cases, acute symptoms generally resolve after about six weeks, although, in very heavy infections, extensive liver parenchymal necrosis can result.</p><p>Extrahepatic symptoms may also occur during the acute phase, likely related to an immunologic or allergic mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A Loeffler-like syndrome or right-sided pleural effusion containing many eosinophils may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pericarditis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, meningeal symptoms, focal neurologic changes, or seizures have also been described but are uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic (biliary) phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic phase usually begins about six months after infection and may last 10 years or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This phase is usually asymptomatic, although epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, wasting, hepatomegaly, and jaundice can occur. Common bile duct obstruction can develop, and chronic infection can lead to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, and obstructive jaundice. Secondary pancreatitis has been reported in up to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heavy infection can also result in sclerosing cholangitis and biliary cirrhosis. Peripheral eosinophilia may or may not be present in the biliary phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ectopic fascioliasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrahepatic involvement may occur; it is unknown whether the parasites migrate to ectopic sites hematogenously or through soft tissues. Ectopic fascioliasis results in eosinophilic and mononuclear infiltration with secondary tissue damage. The most common ectopic site is the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall. The lungs, heart, brain, muscle, genitourinary tract, skin, and the eye may also be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Tender, migrating, erythematous, itchy nodules (1 to 6 cm in diameter) can develop; in some cases, these may result in localized abscesses. Generalized lymphadenopathy may also develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharyngeal fascioliasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharyngeal fascioliasis (&quot;halzoun syndrome&quot;) is a form of fascioliasis that occurs in the Middle East; it is acquired by consumption of raw liver of an infected animal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The living fluke can attach to the upper respiratory or digestive tract, causing pharyngitis with edema and congestion; suffocation may result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of fascioliasis should be considered in patients with abdominal pain and hepatomegaly accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia. A careful dietary history should be obtained, including a history of watercress ingestion or consumption of raw vegetables washed in potentially contaminated water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There is often a delay in diagnosis of fascioliasis. In one review of patients with fascioliasis in developed countries, symptoms related to acute infection preceded the diagnosis for &ge;1 month in 73 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another review with patients with biliary-phase fascioliasis, the delay was even longer (symptoms for 1 to 208 weeks; mean 64 weeks).</p><p>The diagnosis can be established by identifying eggs in stool, duodenal aspirates, or bile specimens. Alternative approaches to diagnosis include identification of adult worms in endoscopic or surgical specimens or serology. Imaging can be an adjunctive diagnostic tool. Additional diagnostic clues include anemia, abnormal liver function tests, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and hypergammaglobulinemia.</p><p>Diagnosis of fascioliasis should prompt evaluation of family members. (See <a href=\"#H3132174\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis can be established by identifying eggs in stool, duodenal aspirates, or bile specimens. Eggs are not detectable in stool during the acute phase of infection or in the setting of ectopic fascioliasis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute (liver) phase'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ectopic fascioliasis'</a> above.)</p><p>Eggs of <em>F. hepatica </em>are oval, yellow-brown, and measure 130 to 150 micrometers long by 60 to 90 micrometers wide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70390\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70390 \">picture 1</a>). It can be difficult to distinguish between the eggs of <em>F. hepatica</em>, <em>F. gigantica</em>, and the intestinal fluke <em>Fasciolopsis buski</em>. Specimen concentration facilitates egg identification. Examination of multiple specimens may be needed because egg excretion may be intermittent; negative stool examinations do not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p>Since stool examination may be negative during the acute phase or in the setting of ectopic fascioliasis, in such cases, the diagnosis may require serology or examination of surgical specimens following removal of the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Liver biopsy rarely demonstrates eggs or adult flukes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Histopathologic changes that may suggest fascioliasis include Charcot-Leyden crystals, eosinophils, and multiple calcific foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4733004\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopy or surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis may be made during surgery or endoscopy for biliary obstruction when adult flukes are found in the biliary tree. Laparoscopy may also demonstrate nodules in the liver capsule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic diagnosis and management of biliary parasitosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The adult <em>F. hepatica</em> flukes are large, flat, brown, and leaf shaped, measuring approximately 30 mm in length by 15 mm wide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65725\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65725 \">picture 2</a>). The broad anterior portion is covered with scale-like spines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serology usually becomes positive during the early phase of migration through the liver; therefore, it is useful for diagnosing early symptoms prior to the appearance of eggs in the stool. It is also useful in ectopic disease, when eggs are not detectable in the stool.</p><p>Serologic tests include indirect hemagglutination, complement fixation, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, immunofluorescence assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In general, these tests have good sensitivity, but many have suboptimal specificity and cross-react with other parasitic infections.</p><p>ELISA-based assays, especially ones that use genus-specific antigens, have largely replaced other techniques because they are sensitive, rapid, and quantitative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. A variety of different antigens, such as Fas2, CL1, SAP2, and FhSAP2, have been used. For example, in a study among 634 Peruvian children with fascioliasis, the Fas2-ELISA (cathepsin L1-based antibody) had high sensitivity and specificity (92 and 84 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another study, an ELISA employing a recombinant form of the <em>F. hepatica</em> cathepsin L1 as the antigen showed 99.9 percent sensitivity and 99.9 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Many antigens have been evaluated in in-house assays; the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends enzyme immunoassays (EIA) with excretory-secretory (ES) antigens combined with confirmation of positive results by immunoblot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Specific antibodies to <em>Fasciola</em> may be detectable two to four weeks following infection (which is five to seven weeks before eggs appear in stool). Successful treatment often correlates with a decline in ELISA titers, although antibodies may be detectable for years after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>An ELISA antigen capture technique that detects circulating antigens is available and has a reported sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Antigen levels correlate with burden of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, the assay is diagnostic prior to the appearance of eggs in the stool so is particularly useful for diagnosis during acute infection. The assay becomes negative in approximately 65 percent of patients one month after successful therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Useful radiographic tools for fascioliasis include computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86430\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86430 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A review of radiographic findings in fascioliasis noted that multiple small (up to 25 mm in diameter) nodular and branching lesions were the most common findings; these frequently occur in the subcapsular area of the liver parenchyma. They appear hypoechoic on ultrasonography, hypodense on CT, and T2 hyper- and T1 hypointense on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Necrotic areas may be seen especially in larger lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>CT scanning of the liver may demonstrate characteristic hypodense nodules or tortuous tracks due to migration of the parasite through the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thickening of the liver capsule, subcapsular hematoma, or parenchymal calcifications may also be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonography, cholangiography, and ERCP are useful in the biliary stage of infection. These techniques may demonstrate mobile leaf-like flukes in the bile ducts and gallbladder, often associated with stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Irregular thickening of the common bile duct wall may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Peri-portal lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly may be seen, especially in acute fascioliasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2181118\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of fascioliasis varies according to the stage of infection.</p><p>In the acute phase (fever, right upper quadrant pain, and eosinophilia as well as extrahepatic symptoms including a Loeffler-like syndrome), the differential diagnosis includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxocariasis &ndash; Toxocariasis (also called visceral larva migrans [VLM]) refers to human infection caused by roundworms that are not natural human parasites; larvae migrate through the liver and lungs, resulting in hepatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumonitis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by ELISA antibody assay.

Among returned travelers, the diagnosis is established via serology; in endemic areas, microscopy can be used to determine the infecting species and the burden of infection, although it is less helpful in the setting of early infection.

It infects domestic livestock in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in Africa, the Western Pacific, Hawaii, and Southeast Asia. Herbivorous mammals are the definitive hosts and snails (genus <em>Lymnaea</em>) are the intermediate hosts; humans are incidental hosts.</p><p><em>F. gigantica</em> has a similar life cycle and pathology to <em>F. hepatica</em> and also causes similar clinical manifestations in the acute (liver) phase, in the chronic (biliary) phase, and in ectopic sites. The eggs (190 by 90 microns) and the adult flukes (up to 7.5 cm in length) are larger than <em>F. hepatica</em>.</p><p>Diagnosis of <em>F. gigantica</em> can be challenging. Eggs are often not detected in the stool and serodiagnosis is often inconclusive. Two reports have suggested that specific antigens of <em>F. gigantica</em> can be detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoblot with good sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. A polymerase chain reaction&ndash;restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay has been used to distinguish between <em>F. hepatica</em> and <em>F. gigantica</em> but is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-flukes-fascioliasis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Until diagnostic techniques improve, recovery of adult flukes in the appropriate epidemiologic setting can be used to exclude or confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>Treatment and preventive measures are the same as for <em>F. hepatica</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3132407\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fascioliasis is a trematode flatworm infection caused by <em>F. hepatica</em> or <em>F. gigantica</em>. <em>F. hepatica</em> has a worldwide distribution; <em>F. gigantica</em> occurs predominantly in the tropics. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herbivorous mammals are the definitive hosts, snails are intermediate hosts, and humans are incidental hosts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50779 \">figure 1</a>). Sheep, cattle, or humans acquire infection by eating aquatic vegetation containing metacercariae, which excyst in the duodenum and migrate through the intestinal wall, peritoneal cavity, and liver parenchyma into the biliary ducts, where they develop into adults. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many infections are mild; morbidity increases with fluke burden. The acute (liver) phase of migration is often associated with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and hepatomegaly. Jaundice is occasionally observed. Other symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, cough, and urticaria. Marked peripheral eosinophilia is frequently present. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute (liver) phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chronic (biliary) phase usually begins about 6 months after infection and may last 10 years or more. This phase is usually asymptomatic, although epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, wasting, hepatomegaly, and jaundice can occur. Common bile duct obstruction can develop, and chronic infection can lead to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, and obstructive jaundice. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Chronic (biliary) phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis can be established by identifying eggs in stool, duodenal aspirates, or bile specimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70390\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70390 \">picture 1</a>). Alternative approaches to diagnosis include identification of adult worms in endoscopic or surgical specimens or serology. Imaging can be a helpful adjunctive diagnostic tool. Additional diagnostic clues include eosinophilia, abnormal liver function tests, and anemia. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest triclabendazole for treatment of fascioliasis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dosing is outlined above. Management of ascending cholangitis requires antibiotics and surgery. Biliary obstruction may require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and direct removal of the parasites if possible.
