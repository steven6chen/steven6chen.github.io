It happens in people who have a long-term skin condition called psoriasis. People with psoriasis have patches of thick, red skin that are often covered by silver or white scales (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74211 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Doctors don't know what causes psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90319168\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the affected joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69282 \">picture 2</a>). It can also affect the spine in some people. Because of the joint and spine problems, people can have trouble moving their body. Stiffness in the joints or low back is usually worse in the morning and lasts 30 minutes or longer. It usually gets better with exercise.</p><p>Psoriatic arthritis can affect joints on one or both sides of the body. It usually affects more than one joint.</p><p>In addition to joint symptoms (and the skin symptoms of psoriasis), people sometimes have other symptoms. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of a finger or toe, or the hands or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail symptoms &ndash; The nails can look &quot;pitted,&quot; as if they were pricked by a pin. The nail can also come up off the nail bed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71998 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye pain or redness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90319223\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for psoriatic arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will order X-rays of your painful joints. He or she might order an imaging test called an MRI. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>To check that another condition isn't causing your symptoms, your doctor or nurse might also order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of fluid from a swollen joint &ndash; To get a sample of fluid, the doctor will put a thin needle in your joint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90319238\"><span class=\"h1\">How is psoriatic arthritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for psoriatic arthritis, but different treatments can help ease and control symptoms. Treatment for joint symptoms usually involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or &quot;NSAIDs&quot; for short &ndash; Examples of NSAIDs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that are usually used to treat other types of arthritis &ndash; Some of these include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">leflunomide</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that block a substance called tumor necrosis factor, or &quot;TNF&quot; for short &ndash; TNF plays a role in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Medicines that block TNF are called &quot;anti-TNF&quot; medicines. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">etanercept</a> (brand name: Enbrel) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">adalimumab</a> (brand name: Humira).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ustekinumab</a> (brand name: Stelara) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">secukinumab</a> (brand name: Cosentyx) &ndash; One of these might be used in people who do not get better with the options listed above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apremilast</a> (brand name: Otezla) &ndash; This is a newer medicine that can help in some people with psoriatic arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shots of medicines called steroids that go into the painful joint &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids help reduce swelling and pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat &ndash; Heat, especially in the morning, can help reduce pain and stiffness. Do not use heat for longer than 20 minutes at a time. Also, do not use anything too hot that could burn your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical and occupational therapy &ndash; This involves learning exercises, movements, and ways of doing everyday tasks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special shoe inserts (called &quot;orthotics&quot;) &ndash; These can help keep your feet, ankles, and knees in the proper position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for psoriatic arthritis is usually long term. That's because even after symptoms get better, they sometimes return later on.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90319253\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is very important that you stay active. You might want to avoid being active because you are in pain. But this can make things worse. It can make your muscles weak and your joints stiffer than they already are. Your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist can help you figure out which activities and exercises are right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90319268\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriasis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
