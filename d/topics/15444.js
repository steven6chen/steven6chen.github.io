Findings suggest that screening mammography both reduces the odds of dying of breast cancer and facilitates the use of early treatment. While breast cancer mortality has dropped dramatically since the 1980s, it is thought that improvements in breast cancer treatment are more likely responsible for this reduction in mortality than screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>Recommendations for breast cancer screening, taking into account the risk of developing breast cancer, other parameters that might affect screening decisions, and benefits and harms of screening, are discussed here.</p><p>Identification and management of women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, and surveillance in women with a personal history of breast cancer, are discussed in detail separately.

Thus, it is important to determine a patient&rsquo;s risk of developing breast cancer and use that information both to recommend the modality and frequency of screening and also to determine whether referrals are needed for genetic testing and for consideration of chemoprevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prophylactic surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4281187790\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in determining a risk category is to assess for major risk factors to identify women at average risk, which is the category for most women, and to identify the smaller number of women at moderate or high risk of developing breast cancer. The risk categories are delineated according to the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer (<strong>not</strong> according to the risk of dying due to breast cancer). Although there is no standardization or consensus about the exact percentages of lifetime risk of developing breast cancer within each risk category, generally they are as follows: average (less than 15 percent), moderate (approximately 15 to 20 percent), or high (greater than 20 percent) lifetime risk.</p><p>Most women can be categorized based on history alone; for others, risk prediction models are available for use if needed. (See <a href=\"#H1353925605\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use of risk prediction models'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Major factors used to determine a risk category, based on a patient&rsquo;s history, are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal history of ovarian, peritoneal (including tubal), or breast cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of breast, ovarian, or peritoneal cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic predisposition (if the patient&rsquo;s <em>BRCA</em> or other genetic marker status is known) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes#H17620869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;, section on 'High-risk hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndromes'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiotherapy to the chest between age 10 and age 30</p><p/><p>Women who have none of these risk factors are usually considered at average risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Most women are in this average-risk category, with an average lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer estimated at 12.4 percent. It is important to remind patients that this is the risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer, <strong>not </strong>of dying from breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The approach to screening for average risk women is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3176979430\" class=\"local\">'Average risk: screening'</a> below.)</p><p>Risk prediction tools are available to stratify the patient&rsquo;s risk (see <a href=\"#H1353925605\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use of risk prediction models'</a> below). These risk tools take into account multiple concurrent risk factors (eg, family history of cancer, prior breast biopsy of atypical hyperplasia) and can help assess whether the patient has an elevated risk of breast cancer to determine if referral for more detailed risk analysis is appropriate. Certain tools may be more appropriate than others depending on the strength of the family history. Use of these tools can estimate the risk of developing breast cancer, which can be then used to categorize the risk as average, moderate, or high, as above. Many women who have a family history of breast cancer still have an average risk. Screening recommendations are in part dependent on this categorization. (See <a href=\"#H3176979430\" class=\"local\">'Average risk: screening'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1614710781\" class=\"local\">'Moderate risk: Screening'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1950807686\" class=\"local\">'High risk: Screening'</a> below.)</p><p>Women who have a personal history of breast cancer, a confirmed or suspected genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2, PTEN, TP53</em>), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest between ages 10 and 30 are at high risk. As an example, women with mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> have a nearly 60 percent absolute risk of developing a breast cancer by the time they are 70 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, because a <em>BRCA1</em> mutation is relatively rare in the population, fewer than 5 percent of all women with breast cancer have deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> mutations, so <em>BRCA1</em> mutations do not account for most breast cancers. Information about hereditary breast cancer and indications for testing for genetic mutations are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer#H3090108380\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Criteria for genetic risk evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes#H17620869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;, section on 'High-risk hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical management of high-risk women, including genetic counseling, indications for prophylactic therapies, and screening, is discussed elsewhere.

These and other risk factors for breast cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83694\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83694 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Screening considerations specifically regarding dense breasts are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Models vary; they may concentrate more on family history or may include personal variables such as history of breast biopsies, parity, and mammographically determined breast density. The models discussed below are available online. Other models are not readily available to practicing clinicians.</p><p>The most widely used tool to calculate breast cancer risk is the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, also known as the Gail Model (see <a href=\"#H2819905921\" class=\"local\">'Gail model'</a> below). However, for women who have strong family histories of breast cancer (eg, more than two first-degree relatives with breast cancer), other models are more useful because of limitations of the Gail model. (See <a href=\"#H839280377\" class=\"local\">'Models emphasizing family cancer history'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical judgment must be factored in with the model-based predictions to determine when to refer for genetic counseling, when to refer for consideration of prophylactic therapies including chemoprevention or surgery, and what screening to recommend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This is because the accuracy of risk assessment tools at predicting whether an individual woman will develop breast cancer is only modest, partly because not all important risk factors have been identified, and partly because accurate stratification requires that risk factors be strongly predictive, whereas most risk factors for breast cancer are not very strong risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer#H13934518\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Genetic counseling'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Chemoprevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer#H373708411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Risk-reducing surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2819905921\"><span class=\"h3\">Gail model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Gail Model is readily available at the National Cancer Institute <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLJe8oIdnKGXQCqBqWKjirJ+KGaSoAIs0Ha7qA1cHHnVr&amp;TOPIC_ID=7564\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a> and is easy to use in general office practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. The Gail model is intended for women who have never had a diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and who do <strong>not</strong> have a strong family history suggesting inherited breast cancer. The Gail model takes into account the patient&rsquo;s age, race and ethnicity, history of breast disease, age at onset of menses, parity, and relevant family history in first-degree relatives.</p><p>The Gail model calculates an individual&rsquo;s approximate risk of developing breast cancer before age 90 and her risk of developing breast cancer within the next five years. These numbers are compared with the predicted risk for a woman of the same age who has average risk factors. There are no confidence intervals around the estimates. As an example, the percentage of white women at a given age who will develop breast cancer over a five-year period and until age 90 is shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52691 \">table 2</a>). For clinical decisions about screening and for better understanding of risk by patients, a shorter time frame (usually 5 to 10 years) may be more helpful than is a lifetime risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3497513006\"><span class=\"h4\">Limitations of the Gail model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of limitations to the Gail model. It may be less precise for older women with competing risks of noncancer death. For the rarer women with strong family history of breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancer, the Gail model is less useful because of factors it does not consider. Specifically, it is <strong>not</strong> applicable to women with more than two first-degree relatives with breast cancer, it does not consider more distant relatives, the age at which relatives developed breast cancer, or a family history of ovarian cancer, and it is not useful for women with a strong family history of breast cancer on the paternal side. In women who have strong family histories, other models may be more useful. (See <a href=\"#H839280377\" class=\"local\">'Models emphasizing family cancer history'</a> below.)</p><p>The Gail model does not estimate the risk of carrying a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene mutation.</p><p>Risk estimates for races or ethnicities other than Caucasian and black may not be as accurate with the Gail model, because either no studies have been conducted or fewer data have been analyzed.</p><p>The predictive value of the Gail model is limited for an individual woman. The sensitivity of the Gail model to identify women who will develop breast cancer is relatively low, reported as 28 to 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], using a five-year risk of 1.67 percent as the cut point between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; risk. The specificity of the Gail model is also modest, reported as 66 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. A figure showing the Gail model&rsquo;s estimated risk of developing breast cancer for each of 80,000 women illustrates the limited ability of the Gail model to separate women into groups who will and will not develop breast cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54619 \">figure 1</a>). In the figure, the curve showing the percent of women at each estimated-risk point who did develop breast cancer overlaps substantially with the curve showing the percent who did not develop breast cancer, and there is no point along the estimated-risk continuum that appears to be predictive to separate women who developed breast cancer from those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Efforts to improve on the Gail model have mainly centered on adding mammographic breast density to other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/13,14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,23</a>] or updating the information on race or ethnicity sub-groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839280377\"><span class=\"h3\">Models emphasizing family cancer history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk prediction models have been developed for patients who have family member(s) with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. Several computerized models not only assess the risk of breast cancer but also the risk of carrying a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene mutation. Simpler paper-based models have been evaluated for sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients at risk of carrying a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Thus, unless the woman has a strong family history or specific (eg, <em>BRCA</em>) genetic mutations, incorporating genetic profiling to evaluate gene combinations that contribute to cancer risk remains theoretical rather than practical for use in determining screening recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As an example, a study that compared classification of risk using either the Gail model, or the Gail model plus 10 common genetic susceptibility variants other than those associated with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>, found that inclusion of the common genetic factors only modestly improved performance of the risk model for predicting breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In these women, age is the most important factor in her decision about when to be screened, because breast cancer incidence rises with age. Breast cancer incidence is quite low under the age of 40, then begins to rise as women age. The sensitivity and specificity of mammography are also age-dependent, being higher in older women than in younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Thus, in younger women, the risk of developing breast cancer over the succeeding 10 years is quite low, and the benefits of screening may not outweigh the costs, inconvenience, emotional stress, occasional direct physical harm, and potential for overtreatment as a result of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>When counseling women on screening, we discuss the potential benefits and harms of breast cancer screening and encourage them to consider their own values and preferences.

In a review of results of 73,335 initial screening mammograms in women aged 35 to 39 years, the positive predictive value was only 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H313584725\"><span class=\"h3\">Age 40 to 49</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most expert groups encourage shared decision-making for women in their 40s because of trade-offs between benefits and harms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551 \">table 9</a>). For average risk women in their 40s, we raise the topic of screening for breast cancer to answer any questions the women might have. Raising the topic is different from strongly &quot;recommending&quot; screening; we engage in shared decision-making to encourage women to individualize the decision based on the benefits and harms of screening and their personal values and preferences (see <a href=\"#H3331475080\" class=\"local\">'Shared medical decision-making'</a> below). For women who decide to initiate screening in their 40s, we typically suggest screening mammography every two years. (See <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> below.)</p><p>Decisions on screening in this age group are highly dependent on a patient&rsquo;s values and preferences. As an example, shared decision-making may result in a 40-year-old woman at average risk choosing to be screened if she has substantial concerns about breast cancer and is willing to accept the possibility of either a false-positive result or overdiagnosis and the resulting evaluation and treatment. On the other hand, a different 40-year-old woman may find that the information gathered during shared decision-making, including the frequency of false positives and overdiagnosis, provides her with a compelling reason to decide to defer mammography screening.</p><p>The net benefits of breast cancer screening are less clear for younger women. Although the benefits of screening women in their 40s appear favorable when considering the number of years of life potentially saved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F105246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105246 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/42,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,49</a>], for the individual average-risk woman, the absolute benefits of screening, when measured by number of breast cancer deaths prevented, are relatively low.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized trials showed a trend suggesting that for 10,000 women screened over 10 years, three deaths from breast cancer could be prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There was an 8 percent relative reduction of breast cancer mortality in women ages 39 to 49 who were randomly assigned to mammographic screening, which did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-1.02). Furthermore, in an analysis of the pooled results of four included trials, screening in women aged 39 to 49 years did not impact the risk of advanced breast cancer (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74-1.37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Similarly, the age trial in the United Kingdom suggested that breast cancer mortality at a mean follow-up of 10.7 years was decreased in the group of women who were invited for mammogram screening at age 40, compared with a usual care group, although the difference was not significant (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66-1.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Risk reduction for breast cancer mortality was greater, though still not statistically significant, when only those women who actually attended the first screening were compared with the control group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.01). (See <a href=\"#H4137039259\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> below.)</p><p>Mammography is less sensitive in younger than older women. As an example, mammography is estimated to detect about 73 percent of breast cancers in women in their early 40s compared with 85 percent of breast cancers in women in their early 60s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Given the modest benefits of screening in the 40 to 49 age group, the harms can be relatively more consequential. In particular, false positives are more common in younger than older women. The harms of screening are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-evidence-for-effectiveness-and-harms#H84437700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms&quot;, section on 'Harms from screening'</a>.)</p><p>Expert guidelines vary in their recommendations about when to initiate screening and how frequently to screen average-risk women in the 40 to 49 age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551 \">table 9</a>). For example, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that mammography screening start at age 45 based on the finding that the absolute risks of breast cancer occurrence and death for women ages 45 to 49 are more similar to those for women ages 50 to 54 than ages 40 to 44 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/6,38,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38,53,54</a>]. The ACS concluded that this similarity in risks of occurrence and mortality outweighs the higher false-positive mammogram rates in women under age 50. The ACS recommends continuing annual screening until age 55, then decreasing to every two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3655625084\"><span class=\"h3\">Age 50 to 74</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest breast cancer screening with mammography for average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years. We typically screen every two years, unless the prior screening identified a finding for which more frequent breast imaging was advised. (See <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> below.)</p><p>Systematic reviews of multiple randomized trials over the past 50 years found that mammogram screening for women aged 50 to 70 decreases the risk of breast cancer mortality; however, these results largely reflect trials that used older mammography imaging techniques and did not involve current breast cancer treatment protocols, a factor which may limit the predictive value of the results. Subsequently, a 2016 systematic review of screening mammography found fair-quality evidence that mammography decreases the RR for breast cancer mortality for women 50 to 59 years (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68-0.97, seven trials), with a more significant reduction for women 60 to 69 years (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54-0.83, five trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Screening also reduced the risk of advanced breast cancer in women aged 50 years and older (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.83). These benefits are generally thought to outweigh the harms of screening for average-risk women in this age group. (See <a href=\"#H41187217\" class=\"local\">'Benefits and harms of screening'</a> below.)</p><p>All expert groups recommend routine screening with mammography for women at average risk who are age 50 or older, and most agree to continue screening through age 74 years (at least) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551 \">table 9</a>). However, recommendations on the frequency of mammography screening for this age group vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/7,39,40,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,39,40,55-57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1901864476\"><span class=\"h3\">Age 75 and older</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that women over the age of 74 be offered screening only if their life expectancy is at least 10 years. For women in this age group who elect to be screened, we typically screen with mammography every two years. (See <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> below.)</p><p>There is not a clear upper age limit or ideal frequency for screening in healthy women, since the incidence of breast cancer remains high into the 80s, but the number of life-years saved will decrease with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A framework that includes life expectancy, risk of dying of cancer, and the number needed to screen over the remaining lifetime to prevent cancer death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61593 \">table 10</a>) can be useful for guiding decision-making about screening older women for breast and other cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. It is important to ensure that shared decision-making occurs, with information about both the potential harms and benefits of screening. Most potential harms of screening occur relatively soon, whereas a potential benefit may occur up to 10 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H41187217\" class=\"local\">'Benefits and harms of screening'</a> below.)</p><p>Screening mammography may be less beneficial in women age 75 and older, although data from randomized trials for this age group are limited. In two observational studies, screening was associated with a reduction in mortality due to breast cancer up to age 75 but not among older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Similarly, a cohort study of 2011 women 80 years and older found no difference in breast cancer rate, stage, or death between women who did and did not undergo screening mammography after age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, observational studies may be biased, because older women who participate in screening are likely to be healthier at baseline than those who do not. Furthermore, while screening mammography in older women may result in lower-stage cancer at diagnosis, this may not lead to a decrease in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. This reflects several factors: a shorter life expectancy decreases the potential that screening will prolong life; the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increases with age, but it is not clear that treatment of DCIS affects mortality; and screening-detected cancers are usually lower-stage cancers than those detected clinically, due to lead time bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p>Several expert group recommendations do not explicitly state at what age breast cancer screening should stop. Some groups take into consideration life expectancy and consider stopping if life expectancy is under 5 or 10 years. Some groups use age 75 as an age to consider whether or not to continue screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551 \">table 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164375993\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammography (digital or film) is the primary modality for breast cancer screening in average-risk women. Other radiologic techniques, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are reserved for further evaluation of findings on mammography or for screening of women at a higher risk for breast cancer. Breast examination by the clinician or by the patient is not recommended as the only screening method, and it is controversial as to whether clinician breast exam or patient breast self-exam (BSE) are beneficial as an adjunct to mammography. It is important to educate women about breast awareness and to encourage women to report any breast concerns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3838866944\"><span class=\"h3\">Mammography as preferred screening modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among a variety of imaging modalities developed for breast cancer screening, mammography is the best-studied and the only imaging technique that has been shown to decrease mortality as demonstrated in multiple randomized trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F94373\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94373 \">figure 3</a>). However, it is important to know that, even in the best circumstances, mammography may miss up to 20 percent of underlying breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The choice between them generally depends on availability. The vast majority of locations in the United States use digital mammography. For women with dense breasts, digital mammography, if available, is preferred because of higher sensitivity; the sensitivity of mammography is inversely correlated with breast density, especially with older film techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The relative benefits of digital and film mammography are discussed in further detail elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the mammogram, it is helpful for women to know that the compression of breasts is transient but important to reduce motion artifact, improve image quality, and reduce the amount of radiation required. Premenopausal women should not schedule their mammogram around the time of their menstrual period as it may be more painful then and have lower sensitivity, and women should provide access to their prior mammogram films for comparison if they go to a different mammography facility than they used previously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H211239451\"><span class=\"h3\">Other imaging modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For average-risk women, there is a lack of medical evidence to routinely recommend other radiologic modalities or supplemental radiologic screening with ultrasound, MRI, or newer imaging technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, these technologies are useful as adjuncts to screening for certain higher-risk patients and as diagnostic, rather than screening, tools.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening ultrasound is not recommended for average-risk women. Ultrasound has not been evaluated as a screening strategy to reduce breast cancer mortality in the average-risk population, including among women with dense breasts. However, in the United States, some states mandate that ultrasound be mentioned to patients as a potential adjunct to mammography in women with increased breast density. Ultrasonography is commonly used for diagnostic follow-up of an abnormality seen on screening mammography to clarify features of a potential lesion.

Although data are limited and mixed on the optimal frequency for performing mammography, annual screening is associated with more harms and costs than screening every two years, and the difference in absolute benefits between annual and biennial screening is small. While some data suggest benefit for annual screening for some women (eg, premenopausal), this benefit needs to be weighed against the increased risk of false-positive mammogram findings and overdiagnosis.</p><p>Expert group recommendations for frequency of mammography screening vary between annual and every two years screening, depending mostly upon the patient&rsquo;s age. Specific groups&rsquo; recommendations are summarized in the attached table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551 \">table 9</a>).</p><p>Randomized trials have found that screening every two years achieves reduction in breast cancer mortality. In a systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2016 update of breast cancer screening recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], observational studies found that the 10-year cumulative false-positive mammography rates and biopsy rates were more favorable with biennial screening (42 and 5 percent, respectively) than with annual screening (61 and 7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Models also find that screening every two years achieves most of the benefit of screening annually without as many harms. A modeling study of screening mammography using United States data found that per 1000 women screened, biennial screening compared with no screening, for women aged 50 to 74 years, avoided seven breast cancer deaths, while annual screening for this age group had similar benefits but caused more harms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Annual screening in women 40 to 74 years avoided 10 breast cancers but led to nearly 2000 more false-positive results and 11 more overdiagnoses per 1000 screened women.</p><p>The relative benefits of annual versus biennial screening may differ based on a woman&rsquo;s hormonal status (eg, whether they are premenopausal or use menopausal hormone therapy); however, the evidence varies. A 2015 study from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, which sampled United States mammography registries, evaluated the effectiveness of varied frequencies of screening among women who were later diagnosed with breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Among premenopausal women and postmenopausal women who used menopausal hormone therapy, biennial screening was associated with higher proportions of cancers that were less favorable (stage IIB or higher) compared with annual screening. However, in postmenopausal women who did not use menopausal hormone replacement therapy, tumor characteristics were similar for those screened annually or biennially. By contrast, an earlier (2013) Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium study, using age to stratify women, found that hormonal status did not alter the relative benefit of mammography: screening biennially versus annually for women aged 50 to 74 did not increase the risk of tumors with advanced stage or large size, regardless of the women's breast density or hormone therapy use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Breast density may also be associated with benefits that vary with different screening frequencies. As an example, in the same Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium study, among women 50 to 74 years of age with scattered fibroglandular or fatty breasts, biennial or triennial mammography screening lowered false-positive results compared with annual screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, for younger women with dense breasts, frequency of mammography screening did impact the risk of advanced-stage cancer, which was increased for women aged 40 to 49 years with dense breasts who had biennial, compared with annual, mammograms.</p><p>Intervals of more than two years between screenings might be appropriate in certain age groups. A 2016 modeling study suggests that annual screening for higher-risk women with high breast density may be indicated, and triennial screening may be the preferred approach for patients aged 50 years and older with average risk for breast cancer and low breast density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Some have suggested that screening be initiated at an earlier age if a first-degree relative had premenopausal breast cancer.</p><p>For women without a known genetic syndrome, there are no data from randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of mammography in reducing mortality in younger women with a family history of breast cancer.

Supplemental screening ultrasound may be more widely accessible and less expensive than supplemental MRI; however, neither modality is routinely covered by insurance for this risk category in most states.

Nevertheless, we do not alter our general approach to age- and risk-based screening based on breast density. However, for women with dense breasts, we do prefer digital mammography over film mammography, due to greater sensitivity; digital mammography is the modality typically used for mammography in most locations in the United States.</p><p>We suggest that most women with dense breasts and no additional risk factors for breast cancer <strong>not</strong> undergo supplemental screening with other imaging modalities given insufficient evidence demonstrating benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/7,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,85</a>]. Nevertheless, some women with dense breasts may reasonably opt to have supplemental screening. For average-risk women who choose to undergo supplemental screening, given its lower cost and availability of more data in this population, ultrasound is preferred over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>).

A 2016 systematic review analyzed risk reduction by age: with at least 11 years of follow-up, the pooled relative risk for breast cancer mortality was 0.92 (95% CI 0.75-1.02) for women 39 to 49 years of age, 0.86 (0.68-0.97) for women 50 to 59 years of age, and 0.67 (0.54-0.83) for women 60 to 69 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Nevertheless, observational studies continue to support a risk reduction in breast cancer mortality with mammography. These studies are discussed elsewhere.

Estimates for overdiagnosis in breast cancer range from 10 percent or less to over 50 percent of all women diagnosed with breast cancer. Variation in these estimates is likely related to differences in definition (eg, whether ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] is included and what age group is studied) and approaches used for study design, measurement, and estimation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-100</a>].

It is not possible to distinguish biologically insignificant cancers from those that will proceed to grow, metastasize, and lead to the patient's death at this time. Thus, almost all patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, regardless of its stage, receive some sort of local therapy (eg, surgery, with or without radiation therapy) and often systemic therapy as well.

Women who have a personal history of cancer of the ovary, breast, peritoneum, or fallopian tube, a genetic mutation (eg, <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2)</em>, or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest between ages 10 and 30 are at high risk for developing breast cancer.

Another woman may find that the frequency of false positives and overdiagnosis provides a compelling reason to defer screening. Although screening in the 40s appears favorable when considering the number of years of life potentially saved, for an average-risk woman, the number of breast cancer deaths prevented is relatively low. (See <a href=\"#H313584725\" class=\"local\">'Age 40 to 49'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women age 50 to 74, we<strong> </strong>suggest screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3655625084\" class=\"local\">'Age 50 to 74'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women age 75 and older, we suggest screening only if their life expectancy is at least 10 years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1901864476\" class=\"local\">'Age 75 and older'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For average-risk women who decide to be screened, we recommend screening with mammography rather than other modalities (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). While ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful for diagnostic evaluation of abnormal findings noted on screening mammography, we do not use these modalities to screen average-risk women. We suggest a mammography screening interval of every two years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). More frequent screening is not likely to improve detection rates and is associated with a higher rate of false positives. (See <a href=\"#H211239451\" class=\"local\">'Other imaging modalities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79986\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of screening with mammography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest not using clinical breast examination (CBE) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) or breast self-examination (BSE) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) as part of screening of average-risk women. Women should be educated about breast health awareness. (See <a href=\"#H45426149\" class=\"local\">'Role of clinical breast examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2627107018\" class=\"local\">'Role of breast self-examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate-risk women<strong> </strong>include most women with breast cancer in a first-degree relative but without a known genetic syndrome. For women with moderate risk, we suggest the same screening approach as for average-risk women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some practitioners screen earlier if the first-degree relative had premenopausal breast cancer, although there are no data showing a mortality benefit for these women. For women who wish supplemental screening with ultrasound or MRI, for which data are inconclusive, we encourage enrollment in a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H1614710781\" class=\"local\">'Moderate risk: Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3176979430\" class=\"local\">'Average risk: screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk women warrant referral to a high-risk screening clinic for evaluation and possible intensified surveillance and consideration of genetic testing and risk reduction treatment (eg, chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery). High-risk women include those who have a personal history of ovarian, peritoneal, tubal, or breast cancer; a genetic predisposition (<em>BRCA</em> or other susceptibility genes); prior radiotherapy to the chest; or other breast cancer risk factors, such as a strong family history, resulting in a calculated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer of greater than 20 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dense breast tissue is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and can decrease the sensitivity of mammography. Nevertheless, we do not alter our general approach to age- and risk-based screening based on breast density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast density and screening for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shared decision-making should be used in discussing screening. Decision aids can be helpful when discussing the patient&rsquo;s risk of developing breast cancer, the potential benefits and harms of screening, and the patient&rsquo;s values. (See <a href=\"#H41187217\" class=\"local\">'Benefits and harms of screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3331475080\" class=\"local\">'Shared medical decision-making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The benefit of screening with mammography is a decrease in breast cancer mortality. However, the absolute benefit is lower in younger women who have a lower baseline risk of cancer, and data are limited as to the benefit of screening using contemporary imaging techniques in the setting of effective modern therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Harms associated with breast cancer screening include the potential for overdiagnosis, false-positive findings, patient anxiety, and unnecessary treatment and its associated risks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1340118405\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Suzanne W Fletcher, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Welch HG, Prorok PC, O'Malley AJ, Kramer BS.
