Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival. </p><p>Death from aortic dissection can be related to rupture of the dissection into the pericardium precipitating cardiac tamponade, acute dissection into the aortic valvular annulus leading to severe aortic regurgitation, obstruction of the coronary artery ostia leading to myocardial infarction, and end-organ failure due to abdominal aortic branch vessel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) has provided a contemporary perspective from the worldwide accrual of patients into a prospective database and allowed assessment of treatment paradigms. Despite the advances detailed in their reports, mortality related to aortic dissection remains high at 25 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection will be reviewed here. Medical and surgical management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular management of type B aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108601726\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic dissection is classified, somewhat arbitrarily, as acute or chronic based upon the duration of symptoms at the time of presentation. During the first two weeks (acute phase), life-threatening complications due to branch involvement or aortic rupture are more likely to occur compared with the timeframe past two weeks (chronic phase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9438630\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main anatomic classifications used to describe aortic dissection are the DeBakey and Stanford (Daily) systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The Stanford system is more widely used and classifies dissections that involve the ascending aorta (and may progress to involve the arch or descending aorta) as type A, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear, and all other dissections as type B. By comparison, the DeBakey system is based upon the site of origin, with type 1 originating in the ascending aorta and propagating to at least the aortic arch, type 2 originating in and confined to the ascending aorta, and type 3 originating in the descending aorta and extending distally or proximally. An alternative classification has been proposed; the DISSECT system assesses six characteristics of dissection that provide the most important details influencing the choice of treatment, particularly those that are important when considering an endovascular procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Ascending aortic dissections are almost twice as common as descending dissections. The right lateral wall of the ascending aorta is the most common site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients with an ascending aortic dissection, aortic arch involvement occurs in up to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Isolated abdominal aortic dissection is sporadically reported and can be due to iatrogenic, spontaneous, or traumatic mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F101579\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101579 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The infrarenal abdominal aorta is more commonly involved than the suprarenal aorta. In one review of 52 reported cases, the entry site for spontaneous isolated abdominal aortic dissections (SIAADs) most commonly occurred between the renal arteries and inferior mesenteric artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm was identified in 40 percent of patients and indicated the need for repair.

The false channel is probably produced by a rupture of the vaso vasorum into the media of the aortic wall and can occur in the absence of significant atherosclerosis or with concomitant atherosclerotic ulcer. The clinical features and management of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes#H1708752646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intimal tear without hematoma &ndash; Intimal tear without hematoma is an uncommon variant of aortic dissection that is characterized by a stellate or linear intimal tear associated with exposure of the underlying aortic media or adventitial layers. There is no progression or separation of the medial layers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F101393\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101393 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Blunt aortic injury with focal tear may manifest in this manner.

Degeneration of the aortic media, or cystic medial necrosis, is felt to be a prerequisite for the development of nontraumatic aortic dissection. Blood passes into the aortic media through the tear, separating the intima from the surrounding media <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adventitia and creating a false lumen. It is uncertain whether the initiating event is a primary rupture of the intima with secondary dissection of the media or hemorrhage within the media and subsequent rupture of the overlying intima [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Fifty to 65 percent of aortic intimal tears originate in the ascending aorta within the sinotubular junction and extend to involve remaining portions of the thoracoabdominal aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of intimal tears will originate in the vicinity of the left subclavian artery and extend into the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The commonality of these two predominant locales for development of the aortic tear is hypothesized to be related to shear forces <span class=\"nowrap\">(dP/dT)</span> being highest in these regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/5,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,18</a>]. </p><p>The dissection can propagate proximally or distally to involve the aortic valve and enter the pericardial space or branch vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Such propagation is responsible for many of the ischemic clinical manifestations, including aortic regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101679 \">figure 3</a>), cardiac tamponade, or ischemia (coronary, cerebral, spinal, or visceral). Patients with involvement of the ascending aorta have imminent risk for aortic rupture. The intimal tear with type B dissection can spiral into a cleavage plane within the media of the aorta along the posterolateral descending thoracic aorta, leaving the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and right renal artery, typically originating in the true lumen, with the left renal artery deriving false lumen flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Variations in anatomy of the dissection are typical and underscore the critical need for proper axial imaging. In addition, multiple communications may form between the true lumen and the false lumen. </p><p>Immediately following dissection, there is &quot;intrinsic true lumen collapse&quot; to a variable degree, and false lumen dilation, thus increasing the aortic cross-sectional area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The increase of the false lumen area correlates with blood pressure, the size of the entry tear into the false lumen, the depth of the dissection plane within the media, and the percentage of aortic circumference involved. Because the outer wall of the false lumen is thinned, it expands to generate the necessary wall tension to accommodate aortic pressure. The true lumen collapses as a result of the pressure differential between the true and false lumens and may be exacerbated by the intrinsic recoil of the muscular elements within the dissection flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Malperfusion of aortic branch vessels may occur due to the extension of the dissection throughout the thoracoabdominal aorta. Malperfusion of a vascular bed can occur in one or more branch territories simultaneously. The standard nomenclature of the mechanisms of malperfusion of aortic branch vessels is termed &quot;dynamic obstruction&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109916 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109918\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef109918 \">movie 1</a>) and &quot;static obstruction&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109917 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Malperfusion syndromes may occur in 30 to 45 percent of descending dissections and correlate with early mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/3,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9437294\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acute aortic dissection in the general population is estimated to range from 2.6 to 3.5 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].

TEE is a portable procedure that yields a diagnosis within minutes and is easily performed in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. The sensitivity of TEE has been reported to be as high as 98 percent, and the specificity ranges from 63 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,121</a>]. The ascending aorta is typically assessed at approximately 130 degree orientation while the arch and descending thoracic aorta are assessed at 0 degrees. Biplane imaging may be useful. &#160; </p><p>The advantages of TEE include generally wide availability, ease of use, and bedside capability. In addition, TEE can detect entry tear sites, false lumen <span class=\"nowrap\">flow/thrombus,</span> involvement of the arch or coronary arteries, degrees of aortic valvular regurgitation, and pericardial effusions. The addition of color flow Doppler patterns may decrease false positives by recognizing differential flow velocities in the true and false lumens that may assist in the diagnosis of malperfusion syndromes. </p><p>A disadvantage of TEE is that it requires esophageal intubation, which usually requires procedural sedation, which may have untoward effects in hemodynamically unstable patients. TEE requires the availability of experienced operators (both physicians and technicians) to ensure accurate results. As such, it is often not attainable on a &quot;stat&quot; basis in many centers. The theoretical technical limitation of TEE is the anatomic &quot;blind spot&quot; in the distal ascending aorta and proximal arch secondary to the air-filled trachea and left main stem bronchus, and inability to document dissection extension beyond the diaphragm that may be causing malperfusion of abdominal aorta branches. Despite these shortcomings, TEE can be particularly useful in delineating acute dissection and relevant surgical pathology in the ascending aorta, and therefore, it is chiefly applied in this territory. Moreover, in the unstable patient with a suspected acute dissection in the ascending aorta, TEE may be performed in the operating room to expedite diagnosis and definitive therapy. In the IRAD study, TEE was employed second most frequently (after CT) in the diagnosis and workup of an acute aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>The following findings may be seen on TEE in patients with aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/54,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,118,119</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intimal dissection flaps can be identified with high spatial resolution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69205\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69205 \">image 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69234\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef69234 \">movie 2</a>).

In comparison with other modalities, CT scanning is the least operator dependent, provides useful anatomic correlates for surgical and endovascular therapy, and collects information for follow-up analysis and measurement. Most importantly, three-dimensional CT scan reconstructions can aid treatment planning, and axial imaging affords the best opportunity to detect topographic relationships of the true and false lumens and potential aortic branch compromise. </p><p>CT scanning has a reported sensitivity of 83 to 95 percent and specificity of 87 to 100 percent for the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/119,124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,124,125</a>]. The chief limitation of imaging is the ascending aorta, where the sensitivity may drop to &lt;80 percent, as contrast enhancement can be dependent on timing of the injection. As an example, a CT scan to evaluate for initially suspected pulmonary embolus as a source of chest pain may or may not time correctly for assessment of the ascending aorta. The accuracy of CT may be substantially improved with spiral (helical) CT and perhaps with multidetector (multislice) CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/126-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">126-129</a>]. Spiral CT may be more accurate than MR or TEE for the detection of aortic arch vessel involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. A potential limitation is a spiral CT artifact that can simulate an aortic dissection flap in patients if performed without echocardiogram (ECG) gating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/130-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">130-132</a>]. Thus, ECG-gated scanning is recommended when available. Advantages of CT include ready availability at most hospitals, even on an emergency basis, and identification of intraluminal thrombus and pericardial effusion. Two disadvantages of standard CT are that the intimal flap is seen in less than 75 percent of cases and that the site of entry is rarely identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. In addition, potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast is required, and there is no capability to assess for aortic insufficiency. If the CT is equivocal, or further delineation of the dissection is needed, MR angiography or TEE is indicated.</p><p>The diagnosis of aortic dissection by CT scanning requires the identification of two distinct lumens; the intimal flap may or may not be demonstrated. In most cases, the true lumen may be localized by its continuity with an undissected proximal or distal segment of the aorta. The presence of intraluminal thrombus is a good marker of the false lumen, but in patients with a concomitant degenerative aneurysm, thrombus may be present in the true lumen. In the majority of cases, the false lumen is larger than the true lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. A compressed true lumen is the key radiographic finding, which should substantially raise the index of suspicion for <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/visceral/lower</span> extremity malperfusion syndrome. Curving of the dissection flap into the true lumen is seen in 63 percent of acute type B dissections but only 25 percent of chronic dissections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Indeed, it may be appropriate, if open surgical intervention is chosen as the revascularization procedure, to proceed directly to surgery after CT alone in circumstances where the clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory signs dictate the need for urgent revascularization, as in evidence of bowel ischemia or vascular rupture. </p><p>For hemodynamically stable patients, MR angiography is an alternative to CT angiography, depending on availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/132,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">132,134</a>]. Although less commonly used, MR angiography is highly accurate for diagnosing aortic dissection. Gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography has an overall sensitivity and specificity to diagnose aortic dissection of 95 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. In a prospective trial of 110 patients, MR angiography had 85 percent sensitivity for identifying the site of entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. MR angiography can also detect differential flow between the true and false lumens. Additional suggestive findings include widening of the aorta with a thickened wall and thrombosis of the false lumen. The chief advantage of MR angiography is avoiding excess radiation exposure, and it can be afforded in the long-term serial studies required in the standard surveillance of type B dissection patients. MR is safe in adequately monitored patients with aortic dissection, and MR contrast agents have a more favorable safety profile than iodinated contrast agents. Noncontrast MR angiography is another option. Other advantages of MR include the ability to assess branch vessels, although it may be less sensitive than spiral CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>], and to assess for aortic insufficiency. The main disadvantages of MR imaging are inconvenience (patients are required to remain motionless with relatively limited access for more than 30 minutes) and limited applicability (MR imaging cannot be performed in patients with claustrophobia, pacemakers, or certain types of aneurysm clips or metallic <span class=\"nowrap\">ocular/auricular</span> implants). MR is also not readily available on an emergency basis at many institutions, and there are concerns about patient monitoring and relative patient inaccessibility during prolonged scanning. Gadolinium administration for contrast-enhanced MR imaging in patients with moderate-to-severe kidney disease (particularly dialysis patients) should be avoided. The accuracy of noncontrast MR angiography for aortic dissection has been less well defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27027234\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of aortography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formerly the gold standard for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, aortography<strong> </strong>has largely yielded to CT angiography in the initial diagnosis of aortic dissection. In the endovascular management of dissection, it is used mainly as a component of an interventional treatment strategy. However, for patients in whom the suspicion for ascending aortic dissection is very strong but noninvasive imaging is unavailable or inconclusive, digital subtraction aortography should be performed. Aortography involves the injection of iodinated contrast media into the aortic lumen, permitting identification of the site of dissection, the relationship between the dissection and the major branches of the aorta, and the communication site between the true and false lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55207\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55207 \">image 13</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>Findings on aortography considered supportive of a diagnosis of aortic dissection include distortion of the normal contrast column, flow reversal or stasis into a false channel, failure of major branches to fill, and aortic valvular regurgitation. Most contemporary diagnostic algorithms have deemphasized the role of aortography, especially when assessing for malperfusion syndromes. Furthermore, pressurized contrast injections into either lumen in the presence of aortic dissection can, in fact, lead to diagnostic confusion with respect to malperfusion syndromes by altering the hemodynamic gradients between lumens (during the hydraulically powered injections) that are causing malperfusion. Evaluation for aortic regurgitation, and coronary angiography, when indicated (suspected ascending aortic aneurysm and prior history or angina or myocardial infarction [MI], age &gt;60 years of age, multiple risk factors for coronary disease) can also be performed during the same procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. </p><p>Aortography is only moderately sensitive for the diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. In a review of 164 patients (82 had a dissection), aortography had a sensitivity of 88 percent and a specificity of 94 percent; the positive and negative predictive values were 96 and 84 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Lower values for sensitivity (77 percent) and accuracy (87 percent) were noted in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>]. However, false negative results may be obtained when there is simultaneous opacification of the true and false lumen so that the intimal flap between them is not visible, when thrombosis of the false lumen results in lack of opacification with contrast, or when there is an intramural hematoma with noncommunicating dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/124,138,140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,138,140,141</a>]. Also, intimal tears associated with only a minimal amount of blood in the dissected aortic wall may not be seen with noninvasive imaging. In one study of 181 patients who underwent repair of the ascending aorta or aortic arch, nine (5 percent) had a subtle aortic dissection that was not diagnosed preoperatively despite the use of three or more imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87658869\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of acute aortic dissection includes other entities associated with acute chest or back pain, pulse deficit, and neurologic deficits, which includes both nonvascular and vascular pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

The inciting event in aortic dissection is a tear in the aortic intima. Propagation of the dissection can occur proximal (retrograde) or distal (antegrade) to the initial tear, involve the aortic valve, or branches of the thoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal aorta. Propagation of the dissection (antegrade, retrograde) is responsible for clinical manifestations that can include aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, and end-organ ischemia (coronary, cerebral, spinal, or visceral, extremity). (See <a href=\"#H108602268\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated incidence of acute aortic dissection ranges from 2.6 to 3.5 per 100,000 person-years. Seasonal variation in the incidence of aortic dissection has been noted. Risk factors for acute aortic dissection include advancing age, male sex, systemic hypertension, preexisting aortic aneurysm, and risk factors for atherosclerosis. For patients under age 40, these risk factors are less common, but other predisposing factors are often present, such as collagen vascular disorders, vasculitis, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, Turner syndrome, prior aortic valve surgery, instrumentation, trauma, high-intensity weightlifting or other exercise, and cocaine use. (See <a href=\"#H9437294\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic dissection is classified using two anatomic systems. The more commonly used system (Stanford) classifies dissections that involve the ascending aorta as type A, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear, and all other dissections as type B. Ascending aortic dissections are almost twice as common as descending dissections. Isolated abdominal aortic dissection can also occur. Several anatomic variants of aortic dissection are described, including intimal tear without hematoma and aortic intramural hematoma. These variants are felt to be precursors to aortic dissection. (See <a href=\"#H108602268\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine blood tests are generally nondiagnostic in aortic dissection. However, D-dimer may become a useful screening tool in the setting of chest pain where the cost of widespread imaging would be prohibitive. A D-dimer &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> may indicate a subset of patients who are not likely to benefit from aortic imaging. D-dimer levels may be most appropriate for patients with a low risk for aortic dissection but in whom there remains a clinical diagnostic uncertainty. (See <a href=\"#H9443383\" class=\"local\">'D-dimer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute aortic dissection typically presents with anterior chest pain in ascending aortic dissection or severe, sharp, or &quot;tearing&quot; posterior chest or back pain when the dissection progresses distal to the left subclavian artery. Pain can be an isolated symptom or associated with syncope, symptoms of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, or other clinical signs of end-organ ischemia (splanchnic ischemia, renal insufficiency, extremity ischemia, spinal cord ischemia). Hypertension upon initial clinical presentation is more common with distal type B dissection than with type A dissection. (See <a href=\"#H87661002\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of acute aortic dissection depends upon demonstration of the dissection on imaging studies, which defines the extent of aortic involvement and identifies sites of entry and reentry, branch vessel involvement, aortic insufficiency, and pericardial effusion. No one study is capable of obtaining all the information that is needed to evaluate aortic dissection, and thus a combination of studies is usually obtained. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H87659026\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial imaging study of choice depends upon the hemodynamic status of the patient and institutional resources. It is important to rapidly distinguish acute ascending thoracic aortic dissection, which is a cardiac surgical emergency, from descending thoracic aortic dissection, which is managed medically in hemodynamically stable patients without end-organ complications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Computed tomographic (CT) angiography is generally used as the initial screening study in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected aortic dissection because of its widespread availability and speed of image acquisition, particularly for those presenting to the emergency department in a setting where transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography may be unavailable, especially after hours. If CT is equivocal, or further delineation of the dissection is needed, TEE or MR angiography is indicated. Digital subtraction aortography is indicated when noninvasive tests are unavailable or inconclusive when there is a strong suspicion for ascending aortic dissection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with chest pain suspected of having acute aortic dissection who are hemodynamically unstable, we suggest multiplanar TEE at the bedside or in the emergency department (or operating room) to establish the diagnosis and evaluate the location of the dissection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MR imaging is usually preferred for those who are hemodynamically stable or have chronic aortic dissection, but is time consuming, often not available on an urgent basis, and places the patient away from ready care.
