As an example, CAO from most malignancies and benign tumors is due to a mechanical obstruction to the flow of air (ie, fixed obstruction during inspiration and expiration). In contrast, tracheobronchomalacia results in dynamic airflow obstruction (usually obstruction during expiration) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65386\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65386 \">figure 3</a>).

Presenting symptoms are nonspecific and can be subacute or acute. The clinical manifestations typically depend upon the degree of luminal obstruction, as well as the location and length of time that obstruction has been present. Common features include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and wheeze. In contrast, the demonstration of acute inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress in an at risk patient are worrisome signs of CAO that should prompt immediate diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention. Patients who present sub-acutely are often incorrectly diagnosed as having asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia, which contributes to delayed recognition and therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793418729\"><span class=\"h2\">History and examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CAO usually present over weeks to months (subacute) but may in some cases, present acutely (within minutes to hours). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793418473\"><span class=\"h3\">Sub-acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with minor obstruction are often asymptomatic since airflow limitation is mild.

Choosing among these options is dependent upon the degree and location of obstruction and available airway expertise. </p><p>Airway management of patients with CAO should be performed by skilled personnel with expertise in intubating difficult airways. If no dedicated airway team is available, patient transfer to a specialized center should be considered <strong>after</strong> the patient&rsquo;s airway has been secured and their condition has been stabilized. A multidisciplinary approach that involves a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, oncologist, ear nose and throat specialist, and radiologist is important for maintenance of patency. &#160; </p><p>Most patients can be adequately oxygenated with standard equipment for oxygen (ie, nasal cannulae, face mask). Heliox may be of theoretical benefit by reducing turbulent flow in large airways and at branch points in the tracheobronchial tree (eg, masses at the junction of the right mainstem bronchus and upper lobe) but is not routinely used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-use-of-heliox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical use of heliox&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with CAO undergoing endotracheal tube (ETT) placement, when feasible, we prefer that the patient be awake or mildly sedated and still actively breathing. Paralytic agents are typically not used to avoid the complication of complete loss of the airway in the event that the intubation is difficult, prolonged, or impossible. Although larger ET tubes are preferred for subsequent diagnostic bronchoscopy (eg, 8 mm inner diameter), securing the airway should not be prolonged or delayed for this purpose. Occasionally, an ETT is placed under fiberoptic assistance when proximal friable tracheal lesions are present in order to reduce the risk of exacerbating intraluminal obstruction from bleeding due to a traumatic intubation. A laryngeal mask may be used if the clinician assesses that the risk of traumatic intubation is high. Detailed discussion regarding ETT placement and management of the difficult airway is provided separately.

While the initial bronchoscopy is mostly diagnostic and used to plan further interventions, in some patients bronchoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic (eg, foreign body retrieval, rigid bronchoscopy coring) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>In this population, the initial bronchoscopic evaluation is typically performed using a flexible bronchoscope since equipment of sufficient diameter is required to pass through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.

In most cases, this is achieved bronchoscopically but occasionally surgery is required. The number of interventional bronchoscopic options has increased such that multimodality approaches are often preferred, particularly for patients with lung cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54361\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54361 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103917 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].

As an example, in patients with severe life-threatening intraluminal obstruction from lung cancer, initial tumor ablation (eg, with laser) followed by maintenance therapy (eg, stenting, external beam radiation) may be preferred.

In general, the following principles apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If immediate therapeutic effect, mostly due to severe shortness of breath or severe hemoptysis, is required for life-threatening intraluminal CAO, coring or mechanical debridement using a rigid bronchoscope, with or without dilation and stenting is often preferred. Bronchoscopic ablative techniques including argon plasma coagulation (APC), electrocautery, and laser are suitable alternatives. In contrast, the effects of cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, and endobronchial brachytherapy [EBBT] are delayed and should not be used in this population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have non-life-threatening airway obstruction from an intraluminal mass, all bronchoscopic ablative techniques including APC, electrocautery, laser, cryosurgery, endobronchial brachytherapy, and photodynamic therapy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), airway <span class=\"nowrap\">debridement/coring,</span> airway dilation, and airway stenting can be used. The effects of radiation therapies tend to last longer than locally ablative therapies such that both forms are typically used (eg, local ablation for the immediate effect and radiation for maintenance of patency). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with extraluminal lesions, dilation and stenting are often the only therapies that can result in immediate patency and as a consequence are more frequently used to treat severe life-threatening disease. In such cases, immediate therapy is usually followed by EBRT or less commonly by EBBT. In contrast, patients with non-life-threatening extraluminal disease are typically treated with EBRT first, while dilation and stenting are less frequently needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Importantly, for each patient the decision should be individualized. As an example, although a patient may be suitable for a thermally ablative technique (APC, electrocautery, and laser), the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) should preferably be below 0.4 to avoid an airway fire, such that a clinician may choose non-thermal ablation (eg, cryosurgery) for patients on high-flow FiO<sub>2</sub>. As another example, APC may be more efficient than electrocautery or laser in achieving hemostasis and may be more suitable for patients with CAO who also have significant hemoptysis. </p><p/><p>In general, when these modalities are used appropriately, up to 90 percent of patients will achieve patency and symptom control (average 60 to 80 percent). Success rates appear to be similar among APC, electrocautery, laser, cryotherapy, brachytherapy, and photodynamic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].

However, because the effects are delayed, unreliable, and associated with initial worsening of intraluminal obstruction (from radiation-induced edema), when CAO is severe, EBRT is used after initial airway stabilization and debulking (usually by bronchoscopic ablation) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stenting has been performed.

Laser, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation are used for immediate-relief from obstruction due to intraluminal tumors, while brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy, and cryosurgery are delayed in their effects and cannot be used for this purpose. Only brachytherapy can be used for cancers that cause extrinsic compression.

It is an immediate-acting therapy with excellent debulking capacity, best suited to treating patients with intraluminal tumors causing CAO, as well as those associated with bleeding. Ideal lesions are localized and short (ie, &lt;4 cm) such that the region beyond the obstruction can be visualized and the distal lung is functional. It is not suitable for extraluminal lesions and its effects are not generally long lasting such that it is usually combined with other therapies (eg, EBRT or stent). &#160;</p><p>It is frequently performed via the rigid bronchoscope, but can be safely performed with the flexible bronchoscope by experienced endoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It is an immediate-acting therapy that requires frequent cleaning of debris on the probe. Although it has a high risk of airway fire, the risk of airway perforation is lower when compared with laser. It is not suitable for extraluminal lesions and its effects are short-lived such that it is usually combined with other therapies.

It is usually administered through a flexible bronchoscope. Because it lacks the depth of penetration of laser it is not as good at debulking intraluminal tumors but is associated with a reduced risk of airway penetration. Due to the superficial spread of heat associated with this procedure, it is better suited to treating superficial vascular lesions that bleed easily, flat polypoid lesions (eg, papillomas) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68710\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68710 \">picture 1</a>), or lesions at and around bifurcations in airways, especially those in the upper lobe bronchi and apical segments of the lower lobes. It cannot be used for treating extrinsic lesions and is frequently combined with other therapies. Indications and complications of bronchoscopic laser therapy are described separately.

It may also be administered to patients who have already received maximal doses of EBRT. Its major advantage compared with immediate-acting locally ablative techniques (laser, cautery, APC) is that it is longer lasting and can be used for debulking intraluminal as well as extraluminal tumors. It is not used when immediate relief from life-threatening obstruction is required but may be combined with locally ablative techniques, especially when tumor external to the airway wall needs to be treated. The indications, complications, and efficacy of EBBT in treating central airway obstruction, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-brachytherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial brachytherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229386986\"><span class=\"h4\">Photodynamic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photodynamic therapy is a non-thermal modality that may be used for airways that are completely (or partially) obstructed due intraluminal tumors. It cannot be used for tumors causing extrinsic compression. It has a predictable penetration depth (typically 5 to 10 mm), thus, it can be useful for patients that are unresponsive or unsuitable for laser therapy. Because light therapy is administered bronchoscopically after the intravenous injection of a photosensitizing agent (typically 72 hours), it is not used when immediate relief from life-threatening obstruction is needed. It is usually administered via a flexible bronchoscope and often combined with other local bronchoscopic therapies. Its major disadvantage over the other local ablative therapies is that follow-up bronchoscopy is necessary to remove debris and secretions and that patients&rsquo; skin is photosensitized for at least six weeks after the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial photodynamic therapy in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229387004\"><span class=\"h4\">Cryotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryotherapy is typically performed through the flexible bronchoscope. Among the locally ablative techniques, its main advantage is that the risk of airway perforation is low since cartilaginous structures are cryoresistant due to their poor vascularity, and that it can be performed safely in complete mainstem obstruction. However, its effects on airway patency are not immediate, the hemostatic effect is also delayed which increases the risk for hemoptysis, and repeat bronchoscopy is needed for repeated <span class=\"nowrap\">freeze/thaw</span> cycles and for clearance of debris and secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. It cannot be used for treating extrinsic lesions and is frequently combined with other therapies. The indications, complications, and efficacy of cryosurgery are discussed in detail separately.

Although dilation is immediately effective, the results for cancerous stenosis are usually not sustained, especially for lesions causing external airway compression. In addition, mucosal disruption from dilation may in fact produce granulation tissue and accelerate recurrent stenosis, such that other techniques including laser, radiation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stenting are often simultaneously used to maintain a patent airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The airway may be dilated with rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. During rigid bronchoscopy, the endoscope is advanced through the stenotic airway opening and the barrel is then pushed through the obstruction in a rotating motion (&quot;coring&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105318\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105318 \">figure 6</a>). This procedure may be preferred when obstruction is severe since patients can be simultaneously intubated and treated with the rigid bronchoscope and bleeding is usually minimal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53603%7EPULM%2F68017\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53603 graphicRef68017 \">picture 2A-B</a>). In less severe cases, sequential balloon dilation (flexible bronchoscopy) or sequential rigid dilators (rigid bronchoscopy) may be used (ie, dilators of increasing diameter are used in succession during the same session) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70533 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104099 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The major advantage of sequential rigid versus balloon dilation is that there is generally is less mucosal trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy balloon dilation for benign airway strictures (bronchoplasty)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431683495\"><span class=\"h3\">Debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forceps debridement can be performed for intraluminal CAO using a rigid bronchoscope and is commonly combined with coring when obstruction is severe. Microdebriders have also been used during rigid bronchoscopy to achieve the same effect; a hollow metal tube with a rapidly rotating blade (1000 to 3000 rpm) that is coupled to suction allows obstructing tissue to be dissected while simultaneously evacuating debris and blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Debridement is not commonly used for mild CAO that is non-life-threatening since alternative ablative therapies performed via flexible bronchoscopy are more readily available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229386303\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway stent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stenting is often performed following locally ablative or dilation therapies to prevent reocclusion after patency has been restored. Silicone stents require introduction with a rigid bronchoscope and are in general preferred in patients with cancer. Although self-expanding metal stents, which are positioned using flexible bronchoscopy, are fraught with complications (eg, re-epithelization, mucosal tears, retained fragments during removal), they may be used as a life-saving therapy in a fragile patient with limited life-expectancy who might not otherwise tolerate surgery. Airway stents can be utilized for both intrinsic and extrinsic lesions and require an assurance that the distal airway is patent. Notably, tumors or granulation tissue frequently grow in to the stent such that restenosis is common. Another disadvantage of stents is that follow-up with multiple bronchoscopies is required for the detection of complications which are common. Further details regarding airway stents are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229387140\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical intervention for CAO is desirable when a cure for lung cancer is feasible. However, for bronchial lesions, it usually involves a lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or a sleeve resection (eg, T2aN0M0; stage IB). Tracheal resection for isolated tracheal lesions is not commonly performed; most lesions are assessed as T4 (ie, stage IIIA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 5</a>), such that only select patients undergo surgery when surgical cure is deemed feasible (eg, small lesions [2 to 3 cm] without nodal metastases [T4 N0M0]) and the surgery is technically difficult requiring expertise. The operative morbidity and mortality may be unacceptable in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve, such that patient selection is critical for success.

A variety of accessories including forceps, snares, baskets, balloons, and magnets can be used during flexible (and rigid) bronchoscopy for foreign body extraction. Cryoprobes have also been used to freeze organic material and ablative therapies similar to those used to treat lung cancer (eg, laser) can be used to dissect granulation tissue around foreign bodies that have been present chronically.

However, stents can be placed on a trial basis in patients with symptomatic TBM who fail maximum medical therapy (eg, bronchodilators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, secretion clearance). Patients who respond symptomatically to stent placement may be candidates for surgery, whereas those who do not respond should not undergo surgical resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H883276437\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with benign tracheal and bronchial strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the prognosis associated with benign tracheobronchial strictures is better than with lung cancer in general, the focus of therapy has traditionally been curative with surgical resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320 \">table 1</a>). However, the procedure is risky and stenosis may recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, only short lesions are amenable to resection, and the expertise required for tracheal surgery in particular, is sub specialized and limited in availability. Thus, there has been a paradigm shift toward treating benign strictures with flexible bronchoscopic procedures (alone or in combination) including dilation, stents, laser, argon plasma coagulation, cryosurgery, and electrocautery. However, clinicians should be aware that these procedures can inadvertently worsen stenosis through the induction of granulation tissue and hinder subsequent surgical repair. Choosing among these options depends upon the cause of the stenosis, its shape, length, and available expertise. (See <a href=\"#H1229386289\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopic ablative therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients being considered for tracheal resection, short lesions (&lt;4 cm) are usually more suitable than longer lesions and patients should be referred to a center with expertise. Techniques that are commonly employed are primary end-to-end anastomosis and tracheal sleeve resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Anastomotic complications that result in recurrent stenosis may necessitate multiple dilations, reoperation, or permanent tracheostomy. These complications were noted in 9 percent of patients in one large single center series of over 900 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Although attempts have been made to standardize or quantify improvement using an obstruction score, this is not widely utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central airway obstruction (CAO) refers to the obstruction of air flow in the trachea and mainstem bronchi. CAO can be potentially life-threatening. It is therefore critical that it be recognized and managed promptly. (See <a href=\"#H711680103\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of CAO is unknown. It has a wide range of etiologies, among which airway malignancy, usually non-small cell lung cancer is the most common. Other causes, malignant and benign, are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H711679881\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H711679888\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CAO should be suspected in patients who are at risk of developing airflow obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320 \">table 1</a>). Common clinical manifestations include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and wheeze, none of which are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of CAO. In contrast, acute inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress in an at risk patient are worrisome signs of CAO that should prompt immediate diagnostic evaluation (usually with bronchoscopy) and therapeutic intervention. (See <a href=\"#H711679925\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of the signs and symptoms of CAO include pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and obstruction of the upper airway at or above the level of the vocal cords. Although some of these etiologies as well as the etiologies associated with CAO can be distinguished by clinical, radiologic, or physiologic features, visual inspection of the airway with bronchoscopy is typically needed for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H379124026\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18391746\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When CAO is suspected, we prefer that patients be managed using a multidisciplinary approach in a center with expertise in airway management. However, transfer to a specialized center should not delay the administration of life-saving therapies (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation and initial management'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In cases of life-threatening asphyxiation from CAO, we recommend that initial support be focused on oxygenation and securing a safe airway. Once the airway is secured, a bronchoscopic evaluation of the trachea and bronchi should be performed promptly to diagnose and, in some cases, also treat the underlying disorder. Importantly, these life-saving maneuvers should not be delayed to obtain imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who are stable or in those who become stable following initial airway management, the evaluation should be directed towards assessing the degree and type of obstruction with clinical, radiologic, and physiologic assessment followed by bronchoscopic diagnosis and etiology-specific therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with CAO, further etiology-specific interventions are typically planned. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with CAO from lung cancer should be primarily treated according to the appropriate stage (eg, surgical resection, chemotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> external beam radiotherapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 5</a>). Locally ablative bronchoscopic modalities are typically adjunctive, palliative, life-saving, or bridging therapies that are targeted at achieving patency, decreasing dyspnea and hemoptysis, improving quality of life, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reducing time to extubation. Choosing among them depends upon a number of factors including available expertise, degree of obstruction, tumor characteristics, tumor location, and general health status of the patient. Reported success rates are similar for all of the modalities (up to 90 percent of patients achieve patency) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54361\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54361 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nonmalignant causes of CAO, therapy aimed at treating the underlying etiology is appropriate. Anecdotally, local ablative bronchoscopic therapies similar to those described for lung cancer have been used to relieve life-threatening airway obstruction, although this approach is unproven. (See <a href=\"#H883276388\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body extraction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H883276418\" class=\"local\">'Patients with tracheobronchomalacia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H883276437\" class=\"local\">'Patients with benign tracheal and bronchial strictures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H883276443\" class=\"local\">'Other patient groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following therapy, patients should be assessed clinically for resolution of symptoms as well as for airway patency. The optimal time and tool for follow-up to assess airway patency is unknown. However, with the exception of those who have had surgery, most patients should undergo a repeat chest computed tomogram. In addition, some patients may require repeat bronchoscopy for an alternate indication which allows the clinician the opportunity to visually assess the response to therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5145736\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Armin Ernst, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ernst A, Feller-Kopman D, Becker HD, Mehta AC.
