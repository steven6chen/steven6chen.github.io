They are characterized by early lymph node and distant metastases.</p><p>Surgery provides the only possibility for a cure, but only a minority of patients present with early stage disease and are considered candidates for resection. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52489\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52489 \">figure 1</a>) have the highest resectability rates while proximal (both intrahepatic and perihilar) tumors have the lowest. Resectability rates for cholangiocarcinomas have increased over time, due in part to more aggressive operative strategies and broadened criteria for resectability. However, the majority of cases recur despite complete surgical resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following complete surgical resection, relapse patterns are both local and distant metastases (typically hepatic or peritoneal recurrence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These data provide the rationale for exploring adjuvant systemic chemotherapy as well as radiation therapy-based regimens after resection.</p><p>Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments for cholangiocarcinoma and prognosis for patients with localized, potentially resectable disease will be reviewed here. Epidemiology, pathology, classification, staging, clinical presentation, and diagnosis, as well as surgical management of localized disease, treatment for locally advanced disease, and systemic therapy for metastatic disease are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma#H602423264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'The staging workup'</a>.)</p><p>The traditional guidelines for resectability of cholangiocarcinoma in the United States include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of retropancreatic and paraceliac nodal metastases or distant liver metastases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of invasion of the portal vein or main hepatic artery (although some centers support en bloc resection with vascular reconstruction in such cases)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of extrahepatic adjacent organ invasion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of disseminated disease</p><p/><p>Additional criteria are specific to tumor location. As an example, radiographic criteria that suggest local unresectability of perihilar tumors include bilateral hepatic duct involvement up to secondary radicles bilaterally, encasement or occlusion of the main portal vein proximal to its bifurcation, atrophy of one liver lobe with encasement of the contralateral portal vein branch, atrophy of one liver lobe with contralateral secondary biliary radicle involvement, or involvement of bilateral hepatic arteries. However, as a general rule, true resectability is ultimately determined at surgery, particularly with perihilar tumors. Due to their location within the upper hepatoduodenal ligament, these tumors often extend into the liver and major vascular structures, and preoperative evaluation of resectability is often difficult. Thus, surgical exploration is the appropriate treatment for potentially resectable proximal bile duct carcinomas whenever feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma#H102910639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Criteria for resectability'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma#H102915792\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Whether preoperative biliary decompression should be performed in patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma who present with obstructive jaundice is controversial. For more proximal tumors that will require liver resection, drainage of the future liver remnant is widely accepted. The best method (endoscopic versus percutaneous transhepatic) by which to perform preoperative biliary drainage is also debated. Issues related to preoperative biliary decompression and the use of portal vein embolization to increase the limits of safe resection are addressed elsewhere.

However, in the context of a clinical trial, OLT might be considered for highly selected patients with early stage cholangiocarcinoma arising in the setting of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or those with small (&lt;3 cm) <strong>but</strong> locally unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinomas who have successfully completed rigorous staging and neoadjuvant therapy. Such clinical protocols are accepted and reviewed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and are available at a growing number of transplant centers.</p><p/><p>Neoadjuvant therapy is often not an option for patients with cholangiocarcinoma, the majority of whom are jaundiced and have a poor functional status at presentation. However, the potential benefit of this approach for selected patients has been suggested by the following small reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early series of nine (out of a total of 91) patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy prior to exploration, three had a pathologic complete response while the remainder showed different degrees of histologic response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

Three had a complete pathologic response, and 11 were able to undergo a complete (R0) resection. Despite having more advanced disease at presentation, patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy had longer five-year survival (53 versus 23 percent), and rates of grade 2 to 3 surgical morbidity were no higher (16 versus 33 percent) compared with those treated in the postoperative setting.</p><p/><p>These promising early results support the need for randomized trials testing this strategy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthotopic liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OLT has been evaluated as a treatment for intrahepatic and central cholangiocarcinomas with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/113-128\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-128</a>]. In many cases, the patients were transplanted for PSC, and they were found to have incidental cholangiocarcinomas in their native liver.</p><p>Interest in OLT as a treatment for cholangiocarcinoma was revived by the published experience of the Mayo Clinic, which reported a five-year survival rate of 82 percent in a series of patients with initially unresectable cholangiocarcinoma arising in the setting of PSC who were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by exploratory laparotomy to exclude metastatic disease before transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Of concern, however, 7 of the 16 explants that contained no viable tumor after chemoradiotherapy did not have a pretreatment cytologic diagnosis, raising questions as to incorrect diagnosis in these patients. Furthermore, these results do not reflect an &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis.</p><p>A more recent report of the Mayo experience using an intent to treat analysis (of all patients who were enrolled into the protocol regardless of whether they were transplanted or not) revealed one, three, and five-year survival rates of 82, 63, and 55 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective review of the experience with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by OLT for localized cholangiocarcinoma at 12 United States centers (with 193 of the 287 patients coming from the Mayo Clinic) demonstrated two- and five-year survival rates of 68 and 53 percent, respectively, in an intent to treat analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>Some centers consider OLT following extensive staging and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to be a standard therapy for highly selected patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. However, in our view, given the highly selected nature of these patients, the poor sensitivity of noninvasive staging for cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>], and issues with donor allocation, OLT remains a controversial treatment for cholangiocarcinoma that should only be carried out after careful consideration at experienced centers in the context of a UNOS-approved protocol. </p><p>A 2011 systematic review of published reports performed on behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality came to the following conclusions regarding OLT for cholangiocarcinoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median patient survival was 11.8 months when combining all studies that included a minimum of 10 patients.

However, limited data suggested that one-year patient survival was better in patients with tumors diagnosed incidentally compared with those in whom it was diagnosed preoperatively. Prognosis was also better in those with negative lymph nodes and no residual disease after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not appear to improve survival.</p><p/><p>However, as described above, in a large report from the Mayo Clinic that was not included in the systematic review, a five-year survival rate of 82 percent was reported for patients with initially unresectable disease or cholangiocarcinoma arising in the setting of PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].

They are characterized by early lymph node and distant metastases. Surgery provides the only possibility for a cure; however, only a minority of patients present with early stage disease and are considered candidates for resection. Furthermore, outcomes after resection are poor, particularly with node-positive disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging is used to diagnose and accurately stage the tumor and may include contrast-enhanced multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) of the abdomen, cholangiopancreatography, and possibly positron emission tomography (PET). However, true resectability is ultimately determined at surgery, particularly with perihilar tumors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment and criteria for resectability'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with resected cholangiocarcinoma should be encouraged to enroll on randomized trials testing various adjuvant therapy strategies.
