Signs and symptoms related to the tachyarrhythmia most commonly include palpitations or chest discomfort, but may also include shock, hypotension, heart failure, shortness of breath, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased level of consciousness. Symptoms can sometimes may be more subtle and may include fatigue, lightheadedness, or exercise intolerance.

The most common reason that a QRS is widened is because the arrhythmia originates below the His bundle in the bundle branches, Purkinje fibers, or ventricular myocardium (eg, ventricular tachycardia). Alternatively, a supraventricular arrhythmia can produce a widened QRS if there are either pre-existing or rate-related abnormalities within the His-Purkinje system (eg, supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy), or if conduction occurs over an accessory pathway. Thus, wide QRS complex tachycardias may be either supraventricular or ventricular in origin.

Patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia can present with a variety of symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightheadedness or dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphoresis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p/><p>Most commonly, patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia present with palpitations, the sensation of a rapid or irregular heart beat felt in the anterior chest or neck. Usually the symptoms are abrupt in onset, although this may vary depending on the specific arrhythmia. Palpitations may be associated with diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or dizziness.</p><p>Patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia may also report shortness of breath or chest discomfort. While shortness of breath or chest discomfort can occur in any patient, those with underlying cardiac comorbidities (eg, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease with or without heart failure) are more likely to present in this fashion, particularly at higher heart rates (&gt;150 beats per minute).</p><p>Syncope is a rare presentation for persons presenting with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia, since in most instances the heart rate is not so rapid as to impair ventricular function and cardiac output. However, a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with a very rapid ventricular rate (&gt;250 beats per minute, as might be seen in persons with atrial fibrillation or flutter and an accessory pathway) may result in diminished cardiac output and syncope. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Atrial rate'</a> below.)</p><p>The physical examination in a patient with narrow QRS complex tachycardia reveals a rapid pulse which may be regular or irregular depending on the underlying cardiac rhythm. Cardiac auscultation also reveals a rapid heartbeat. While other physical examination findings may be present in situations where the tachycardia has led to or exacerbated another condition (eg, hypotension following syncope, lung congestion in a patient with heart failure), there are no other specific physical examination findings which are universally seen in patients with a narrow complex tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436522\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia is usually suspected in a patient with palpitations when a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute is present on physical examination. The differentiation between narrow and wide QRS complex tachycardia requires only a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) which shows a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute along with narrow QRS complexes that are less than 120 milliseconds in duration. A variety of arrhythmias result in the ECG appearance of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H26225795\" class=\"local\">'Types of narrow QRS complex tachycardia'</a> above.)</p><p>Once a narrow QRS complex tachycardia has been identified, further scrutiny of the ECG is required to identify the specific arrhythmia in a particular patient, as diagnostic evaluation and therapy will differ depending on the underlying arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"#H684866\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Invasive electrophysiology testing is not required to broadly make the diagnosis of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia, but on rare occasions it is needed to diagnose (and potentially treat with catheter ablation) the specific arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H684866\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a patient with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia involves two primary components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the patient for symptoms and signs of hemodynamic stability (or instability)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) for clues to the type of tachycardia present</p><p/><p>Often these steps are performed near simultaneously in an acute care setting, as the provider can be assessing the patient at the same time that the ECG is being obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing the patient for hemodynamic stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important clinical determination to make when a narrow QRS tachycardia is noted is whether the patient is experiencing signs and symptoms related to the rapid heart rate. These can include hypotension, shortness of breath, chest pain suggestive of coronary ischemia, shock, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased level of consciousness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109811\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109811 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76920\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76920 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Determining whether a patient's symptoms are related to the tachycardia depends upon several factors, including age and the presence of underlying cardiac disease. As an example, PSVT with a heart rate of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> may be tolerated by an otherwise healthy young adult with no or few symptoms (eg, palpitations). On the other hand, AF at a rate of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> may precipitate angina in an elderly patient with significant coronary heart disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically unstable and not sinus rhythm &ndash; If a patient has clinically significant hemodynamic instability potentially due to a narrow QRS complex tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109811\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109811 \">algorithm 1</a>), an attempt should be made as quickly as possible to determine whether the rhythm is sinus tachycardia (ST).

In patients with sinus tachycardia and certain forms of heart disease, such as coronary disease or aortic stenosis, treatment may need to be directed at the heart rate itself. In such cases, cautious use of an intravenous beta blocker is appropriate (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 5 mg intravenously every 2 minutes until the heart rate is controlled, to a total of 15 mg, followed by an oral regimen).

Antegrade conduction occurs down the slow pathway and retrograde conduction up the fast pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79760 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50122\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50122 \">figure 5</a>).

Orthodromic AVRT is more common, and in this form of the arrhythmia, antegrade conduction occurs through the AV node, producing a narrow QRS complex, and retrograde conduction to the atrium occurs over an AV bypass tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71302 \">figure 6</a>).

This pattern of activation results in a wide QRS complex (thus, antidromic AVRT is not a narrow QRS complex tachycardia).

However, this pattern can also occur in the atypical or uncommon form of AVNRT and in AVRT with a slowly conducting accessory pathway (also called &quot;permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia&quot; or PJRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

As a result, the P wave occurs very late in the cardiac cycle (positioning it near to the next QRS complex) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56806 \">figure 7</a>).

Other possible rhythms are atrial fibrillation (AF), AVRT, and junctional tachycardia.</p><p>Although AF is typically an irregularly irregular rhythm, when the ventricular rate is very rapid, it may appear to be more regular. Vagal maneuvers produce a transient decrease in the ventricular rate with AF, which may make the irregularity more evident.</p><p>Junctional tachycardia is an arrhythmia arising from a discrete focus within the AV node or His bundle. In children, junctional tachycardia, also known as junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), is usually associated with significant underlying heart disease. In adults, this rhythm, generally called nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (NPJT), is seen with acute myocardial infarction, digitalis toxicity, and myocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-arrhythmias-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Atrial activity during junctional tachycardia is variable. Retrograde atrial activation may occur, with a P wave that either follows each QRS complex or is concealed in the QRS complex. If retrograde conduction does not occur, independent atrial activity may be seen, with complete AV dissociation that must be distinguished from AV dissociation due to complete heart block (in complete heart block, the atrial rate exceeds the ventricular rate). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, narrow QRS complex tachycardias cannot be discriminated from each other using noninvasive testing.

A narrow QRS complex (&lt;120 milliseconds) reflects rapid activation of the ventricles via the normal His-Purkinje system, which in turn suggests that the arrhythmia originates above or within the His bundle (ie, a supraventricular tachycardia). The site of origin may be in the sinus node, the atria, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the His bundle, or some combination of these sites. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1062221427\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, patients with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia present with palpitations, usually abrupt in onset. Other presenting symptoms may include syncope or presyncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, chest pain, or shortness of breath. (See <a href=\"#H436578\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia requires only a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) which shows a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute along with narrow QRS complexes that are less than 120 milliseconds in duration. (See <a href=\"#H436522\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardias is broad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58019 \">table 1</a>), including atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia, and a variety of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias.

Utilization of vagal maneuvers such as the Valsalva maneuver, carotid sinus massage, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> administration may be required to identify P waves and may at times ameliorate the abnormal rhythm.
