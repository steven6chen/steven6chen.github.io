Major changes in the epidemiology of dengue virus infections began after World War II, and geographic expansion of transmission has continued to date. Given estimates of 390 million infections worldwide each year and over 2.5 billion individuals at risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the dengue viruses remain important arthropod-borne viruses from a medical and public health perspective.</p><p>The cardinal features of the dengue virus transmission cycle, the characteristics of the mosquito vectors, and the factors that contribute to dengue virus transmission in the major affected regions will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of dengue virus infection are discussed separately.

The dengue virus complex comprises at least four antigenically related but distinct viruses, designated dengue virus types 1 through 4. All dengue viruses are mosquito-borne human pathogens that exclusively cause acute infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both epidemic and endemic transmission of dengue viruses are maintained through a human-mosquito-human cycle involving mosquitoes of the genus <em>Aedes</em> (<em>Stegomyia</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Transmission of dengue viruses between mosquitoes and nonhuman primates has been demonstrated in Asia and Africa, but there is no evidence that such transmission is an important reservoir for transmission to humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Susceptible humans become infected after an infected female <em>Aedes</em> mosquito takes a human blood meal. Viremia in humans begins toward the end of a four- to six-day incubation period and persists until around the time fever abates, which is typically three to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. An uninfected <em>Aedes</em> mosquito may acquire the virus from an infected human if they feed during this time and the human viremia is of sufficient titer to support mosquito infection. The incubation period within the mosquito is 8 to 12 days; after this period, it is capable of transmitting the virus to humans. Once infected, mosquitoes carry the virus for their lifespan and remain infective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MOSQUITO VECTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Aedes</em> (<em>Stegomyia</em>) <em>aegypti</em> mosquitoes, the principal vector for the transmission of dengue virus, have many characteristics that make them ideal for dissemination of the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. <em>Ae. aegypti</em> typically breed in or close to houses, laying eggs in both man-made and natural water containers. The typical flight distance is relatively short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <em>Ae. aegypti</em> are preferentially daytime feeders, and their feeding episodes often go unnoticed. They are easily interrupted in their feeding and often move on to another host, frequently taking multiple blood meals in a single breeding cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, an infected <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquito may transmit dengue virus to several individuals within the household. For these reasons, family members who are at home during the daytime, typically women and young children, are at particularly high risk for infection.</p><p><em>Ae. aegypti</em> are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas from latitude 45&ordm;North to 35&ordm;South. Yellow fever is also principally transmitted by <em>Ae. aegypti</em>; efforts to control urban yellow fevers in the Americas in the 1940s greatly restricted the distribution of the mosquitoes in the Western hemisphere, but the mosquitoes have since reinfested nearly all of their former habitats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><em>Ae. albopictus</em> mosquitoes are also a competent vector for the transmission of dengue virus under both experimental and natural conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]; they are more tolerant of the cold and have a wider geographic distribution than <em>Ae. aegypti</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, they are less likely to transmit since they do not feed on humans as frequently as <em>Ae. aegypti</em> and appear to be less efficient natural vectors for dengue virus. Endemic transmission or large outbreaks in regions that have <em>Ae. albopictus</em> but not <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquitoes are both rare. Both <em>Ae. albopictus</em> and <em>Ae. aegypti</em> are also competent vectors for transmission of chikungunya virus, which has led to simultaneous outbreaks of both diseases in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chikungunya-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chikungunya fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes have been suspected of dengue virus transmission in isolated outbreaks in the Pacific islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, these species appear to play an insignificant role in the global transmission of dengue virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295567937\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTRIBUTION OF AE.

The incidences of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is highest in parts of Asia and South America. The risk for exposure to <em>Ae. aegypti</em> is often increased in urban areas. Many tourist facilities present a lower risk than local residential areas because of air conditioning, less standing water, grounds keeping, elevation, or combinations of these factors.</p><p>The number of cases of dengue fever (DF) and DHF reported globally varies considerably from year to year, although the overall trend is one of increasing incidence.

Hyperendemic transmission of all four dengue serotypes (with cases of DHF) has occurred in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia for over 40 years. Epidemic dengue reemerged in China during the 1980s and 1990s after an absence of several decades and was associated with the first occurrence of DHF in that country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A review of epidemiologic trends between 1980 and 2010 indicated increasing incidence of dengue infection, with annual average percentage change of 6 percent in Thailand, 10 percent in Vietnam, 12 percent in Indonesia, 18 percent in Malaysia, and 24 percent in the Philippines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Over 140 locally acquired cases of dengue were detected in Japan in 2014, representing the first occurrence of transmission in that nation since World War II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. More than 80 percent of cases have been associated with visiting a single location in Tokyo, and <em>Ae. albopictus</em> is the apparent vector in this outbreak.</p><p>Dengue virus transmission occurs year round but typically reaches a seasonal peak that varies in timing between countries (for example, between June and November in Thailand, between January and February in Indonesia). More than 200,000 cases of DHF were reported from the region each year from 2012 with the exception of 2011 (177,500 cases); Indonesia and Thailand accounted for the majority of cases in each of these years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A completed dengue vaccine trial in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam demonstrated significant reporting differences between national surveillance systems and the trial's active case finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295567980\"><span class=\"h3\">South Asia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Ae. aegypti</em> are widely distributed in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Dengue virus transmission, particularly in India and Sri Lanka, increased substantially during the 1980s and 1990s. Hyperendemic circulation of all four dengue serotypes appears to be established, and outbreaks of DHF have become more frequent. Over 50,000 cases were reported from India in 2012, more than twice the average over the previous decade. A seroprevalence study among children living in India noted rates of seropositivity between 60 and 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295567986\"><span class=\"h3\">Western Pacific islands</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquitoes are present in most of the region.

If sufficiently large populations of susceptible hosts and mosquitoes are present, transmission of dengue is explosive, leading to a recognizable epidemic. The incidence of infection among susceptible individuals often reaches 25 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and can be considerably higher. Herd immunity, changes in weather, and mosquito control efforts can all contribute to the termination of the epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Prior to World War II, transmission of dengue viruses almost exclusively followed this pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Seaports frequently were the point of initial introduction of dengue viruses, and these port cities then acted as distribution points to nearby inland areas.</p><p>In smaller island nations, certain areas of South America and Africa, and in the areas of Asia where dengue virus transmission has reemerged, epidemic activity is the predominant pattern of dengue virus transmission. The incidence of dengue virus infections in these locations varies considerably from year to year. Intervals of several years or more usually pass between epidemics, allowing the number of susceptible individuals to accumulate so that the next epidemic can be perpetuated.</p><p>In the setting of epidemic transmission, adults and children in the local population are affected. Among travelers, the risk for acquisition of dengue virus is high during an epidemic but low at other times. The frequency of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is usually low, with some exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The viral serotype and strain and the interval since the previous epidemic seem to influence the risk for DHF.

This requires the year-round presence of competent vector mosquitoes and either a large population or steady movement of individuals into the area to maintain a pool of susceptible individuals. Hyperendemic circulation involves the occurrence of multiple epidemics in a smaller geographic scale (eg, village or school) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Seasonal variation in virus transmission is common. The incidence of infection also varies from year to year, with increased dengue transmission at intervals of three to four years, but this variation is not as dramatic as in areas where transmission predominantly follows the epidemic pattern. A mathematical analysis of data from Thailand suggested that these surges in dengue transmission originate in waves from major urban centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Areas with hyperendemic dengue virus transmission contribute to the majority of cases of dengue virus infection globally.

Urban areas are particularly affected.</p><p>In the setting of hyperendemic transmission, the prevalence of antibody against dengue virus rises with age. Children are more likely than adults to experience disease, and most adults in the local population are immune to infection. Among travelers, the risk for acquisition is higher than in areas that experience epidemic transmission, but the seasonal variation in risk is somewhat predictable. Hyperendemicity is a major factor contributing to the occurrence of DHF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS INFLUENCING TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The worldwide incidence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) has been increasing in the past several decades, and the geographic distribution of these diseases has expanded. The emergence of DHF as a public health problem has largely been a result of human behaviors including population growth, poor urban planning with overcrowding and poor sanitation, modern transportation, which allows increased movement of humans, mosquitoes, and viruses, and lack of effective mosquito control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The potential effects of global climate change are a major source of concern for the future. Increased dengue virus transmission has been associated with El <span class=\"nowrap\">Ni&ntilde;o/Southern</span> Oscillation events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Mathematical models predict that increased global temperatures will further expand the range of <em>Ae. aegypti</em> and dengue virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>The transmission cycle for dengue viruses is dependent upon the interaction between infective mosquitoes and susceptible humans and between susceptible mosquitoes and viremic humans. Dengue virus transmission is enhanced by the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased vector density &ndash; One study of naturally infected humans estimated that viremia levels of approximately 6 to 8 log10 RNA <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> led to infection of half of <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquitoes that took a blood meal under laboratory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In many tropical countries, seasonal increases in rainfall contribute to an increased density of mosquitoes.

However, as the prevalence of prior infection increases, the fraction of the population that remains susceptible is reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased duration and magnitude of viremia in humans &ndash; Attenuated virus strains produced in the laboratory have been shown to produce low titers of virus in the blood, which are not efficiently transmitted to mosquitoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. It is unclear whether natural strains of dengue virus differ in the viremia titers they produce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER ROUTES OF TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the high titers of infectious dengue virus found in blood and tissues during acute infection, the potential exists for virus transmission by routes other than mosquito vectors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Nosocomial transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dengue virus may be transmitted via blood products, needlestick injury, and mucocutaneous exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].

The dengue virus complex comprises four antigenically related but distinct viruses, which are mosquito-borne human pathogens. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Susceptible humans become infected after being bitten by an infected female <em>Aedes</em> mosquito. Viremia in humans begins toward the end of a four- to six-day incubation period and persists until fever abates. An uninfected <em>Aedes</em> mosquito may acquire the virus after feeding on an infected individual during this viremic period. Once infected, mosquitoes carry the virus for their lifespan and remain infective for humans. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transmission cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes are daytime feeders that prefer to bite humans and are frequently unnoticed. They are easily interrupted in their feeding and move on to another host, frequently taking multiple blood meals in a single breeding cycle. Thus, an infected <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquito may transmit dengue virus to several individuals within a small geographic area. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mosquito vectors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemic dengue transmission occurs when the introduction of dengue virus into a region is an isolated event involving a single virus strain. If sufficiently large populations of susceptible hosts and mosquitoes are present, transmission of dengue is explosive, leading to a recognizable epidemic. Herd immunity, changes in weather, and mosquito control efforts can all contribute to the termination of the epidemic. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidemic dengue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Hyperendemic&quot; transmission refers to the continuous circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes in the same area. This requires the year-round presence of competent vector mosquitoes and an ongoing presence of susceptible individuals. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hyperendemic dengue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dengue virus transmission is enhanced by multiple factors, including higher vector density, greater movement of mosquito vectors, and increased density of susceptible humans. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Factors influencing transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ae. aegypti</em> and dengue viruses are endemic in every continent except Europe and Antarctica, although epidemic dengue hemorrhagic fever occurs predominantly in Asia and the Americas.
