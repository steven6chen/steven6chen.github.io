Examination of the language of dyspnea suggests that this symptom represents a number of qualitatively distinct sensations, and that the words utilized by patients to describe their breathing discomfort may provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of the disease.</p><p>The key elements in the evaluation of the patient with dyspnea will be reviewed here. The basic physiology of dyspnea, the evaluation of acute dyspnea, and dyspnea in pregnancy are discussed separately.

The experience derives from interactions among multiple physiological, psychological, social, and environmental factors, and may induce secondary physiological and behavioral responses.&quot; </p><p>Dyspnea is considered acute when it develops over hours to days and chronic when it has been for more than four to eight weeks. Some patients present with acute worsening of chronic breathlessness that may be caused by a new problem or a worsening of the underlying disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure).</p><p>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea, as well as other ATS guidelines, can be accessed through the ATS web site at <a href=\"http://www.thoracic.org/statements&amp;token=qarzLAn4JdAbZ323FG1scHYDG28iQPBGI48zV/nNgilsEm3QCjSmQIzVQkX5XXr+&amp;TOPIC_ID=1436\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.thoracic.org/statements</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with breathing discomfort can be categorized into one of two groups: respiratory system dyspnea or cardiovascular system dyspnea. Respiratory system dyspnea includes discomfort related to disorders of the central controller, the ventilatory pump, and the gas exchanger, while cardiovascular system dyspnea includes cardiac diseases (eg, acute ischemia, systolic dysfunction, valvular disorders, pericardial diseases), anemia, and deconditioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69322 \">figure 1</a>). More than one process may be active in a given patient, and the basic physiology of dyspnea does not always adhere to this structure; for example, stimulation of pulmonary receptors can result from interstitial inflammation (respiratory system) or interstitial edema (cardiovascular system). Nevertheless, this construct offers an organized approach to the patient with dyspnea of unclear etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The respiratory system is designed to move air by bulk transport from the atmosphere to the alveoli, where oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide by diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Carbon dioxide is then removed from the lungs by bulk transport to the atmosphere. Several components must be functioning smoothly for this process to occur; derangements in any of these elements can lead to dyspnea.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Controller</strong> &ndash; The &quot;respiratory controller&quot; determines the rate and depth of breathing via efferent signals sent to the ventilatory muscles. Factors that stimulate the respiratory centers in the brainstem lead to increased ventilation and breathing discomfort in a variety of settings; these often are secondary to derangements in other parts of the system, such as hypoxia or hypercapnia due to <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatching in the gas exchanger, or stimulation of pulmonary receptors as occurs with interstitial inflammation or edema. In addition, drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (at a toxic dose) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> and conditions such as pregnancy or diabetic ketoacidosis can produce dyspnea through central effects independent of problems in the ventilatory pump or gas exchanger. Typically, dyspnea associated with stimulation of the respiratory controller is described as a sensation of &quot;air hunger&quot; or an &quot;urge or need to breathe&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To some degree, the breathing pattern may also reflect what are presumed to be attempts by the controller to reduce breathing discomfort. Thus, patients with severe airflow obstruction generally adapt a slow, deep breathing pattern to minimize the pleural pressures needed to overcome airways resistance. Alternatively, patients with interstitial fibrosis or kyphoscoliosis and reduced lung or chest wall compliance have a characteristic rapid, shallow breathing pattern which minimizes the work needed to expand the thorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the respiratory controller is stimulated (eg, by exercise), airflow obstruction may heighten the sensation of air hunger. The increase in respiratory rate during exercise in the setting of expiratory flow limitation can lead to exercise-induced air-trapping, a process known as dynamic hyperinflation. Dynamic hyperinflation is associated with a reduced inspiratory reserve and increased dyspnea. For those in whom hyperinflation is substantial, such that inspiratory capacity at rest or during exercise is limited by total lung capacity, dyspnea is further exacerbated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with restrictive lung disease, the adoption of breathing patterns with either an increase or decrease in tidal volume from their average resting tidal volume results in increased dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Breathing with a rapid, shallow pattern, the patient experiences an increase in the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (since anatomic dead space is relatively fixed), which leads to a need for greater total ventilation (hence, the increase in respiratory rate); this adds to respiratory work-load and may contribute to the development of hypercapnia. In contrast, an increase in tidal volume requires a significant increase in respiratory work due to the stiffness of the lung. Since most patients with restrictive lung disease tend to use a rapid, shallow breathing pattern, we conclude that this pattern ultimately must produce less dyspnea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventilatory pump</strong> &ndash; The &quot;ventilatory pump&quot; comprises the ventilatory muscles, the peripheral nerves which transmit signals to them from the controller, the bones of the chest wall to which the respiratory muscles are connected, the pleura which transforms movement of the chest wall to negative pressure inside the thorax, and the airways that serve as a conduit for the flow of gas from the atmosphere to the alveoli and back again. The most common derangements of the ventilatory pump result in a sense of increased &quot;work of breathing&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neuromuscular weakness (eg, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) leads to a condition in which the patient must exert near maximal inspiratory effort to produce a normal negative pleural pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with reduced compliance of the chest wall (eg, kyphoscoliosis) or lungs (eg, interstitial fibrosis) must perform more work than normal to move air into the lungs. Obstructive lung disease is associated with increased resistance to flow and, in patients with significant hyperinflation, reduced compliance as breathing occurs on the stiff portion of the pressure-volume curve of the respiratory system. When hyperinflation results in an end-inspiratory volume that approximates total lung capacity, patients often complain of an inability to get a deeper satisfying breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A sensation of chest tightness may also be present in patients in whom acute bronchoconstriction is the cause of airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/6,7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gas exchanger</strong> &ndash; The &quot;gas exchanger&quot; consists of the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries across which oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse. Most of the common cardiopulmonary disorders leading to dyspnea are associated with some derangement of the gas exchanger due either to destruction of the diffusing membrane (eg, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) or the imposition of fluid or inflammatory material between the capillaries and the gas in the alveoli. Diseases affecting the gas exchanger are typically characterized by hypoxemia, either at rest or with exercise, and by chronic hypercapnia in more severe cases. These gas exchange abnormalities stimulate the respiratory centers in the brainstem and lead to a sensation of &quot;air hunger&quot; or an increased urge to breathe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiovascular system is designed to move oxygenated blood from the lungs to metabolically active tissues, and then transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. For this system to work optimally and avert breathing discomfort, one must have a pump that functions without generating high pulmonary capillary pressures. There must also be sufficient hemoglobin to carry oxygen and appropriate enzymes to utilize oxygen in the tissues.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> &ndash; Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle(s) to fill with or eject blood. Symptoms of heart failure fall into two major classes: those due to a reduction in cardiac output (fatigue, weakness) and those due to increased pulmonary or systemic venous pressure and fluid accumulation (dyspnea, edema, hepatic congestion, and ascites). When heart failure causes an increase in pulmonary venous pressure, it can lead to dyspnea either by producing hypoxemia or by stimulating pulmonary vascular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interstitial receptors (eg, unmyelinated J-receptors, also called C-fibers). Causes of heart failure include ventricular systolic dysfunction, ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and valvular disease. Cardiac tamponade may also lead to dyspnea by increasing pulmonary vascular pressures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia</strong> &ndash; Anemia can severely impair oxygen delivery because the bulk of oxygen carried in the blood is hemoglobin-bound (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>). Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which anemia produces dyspnea is not known. To the extent that the local pH of metabolically active cells decreases due to the inability to sustain aerobic metabolism, there may be stimulation of &quot;ergoreceptors,&quot; which are believed to be located in the muscles and which respond to such changes in the microenvironment of the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Anemia also leads to increased cardiac output, which may necessitate elevated left ventricular volume and pulmonary vascular pressures. However, the quality of dyspnea is usually quite different in these two clinical situations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deconditioning</strong> &ndash; Individuals usually complain of respiratory discomfort when they engage in vigorous physical activity, even in the presence of a normal cardiovascular and respiratory system and normal hematocrit. More fit individuals experience less discomfort for any given workload; cardiovascular fitness is determined by the ability of the heart to increase maximal cardiac output and by the ability of the peripheral muscles to utilize oxygen efficiently for aerobic metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, a sedentary existence reduces fitness and leads to dyspnea, often with seemingly trivial tasks. It is common for patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease to assume a sedentary lifestyle in an effort to avoid breathing discomfort. However, the end result over a span of months to years is that the individual becomes progressively deconditioned and ultimately may be limited more by poor cardiovascular fitness than by the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dyspnea due to deconditioning is typically described as &quot;heavy breathing&quot; or a sense of &quot;breathing more&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and with careful questioning, one can determine that the patient is actually limited by fatigue rather than breathing discomfort.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While clinical history is often insufficient to make a secure diagnosis, it provides guidance in narrowing the diagnostic possibilities and selecting diagnostic tests. In one study of 85 patients presenting to a pulmonary unit with a complaint of chronic dyspnea, the initial impression of the etiology of dyspnea based upon the patient history alone was correct in only 66 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, a systematic diagnostic approach to these patients is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77932471\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal pattern and triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temporal pattern of breathlessness and association with certain triggers can provide important clues. Breathing discomfort arising over the course of minutes to hours is due to a relatively limited number of conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82700\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82700 \">table 1</a>). These entities typically have associated symptoms and signs that provide clues to the appropriate diagnosis, eg, substernal chest pain with cardiac ischemia; fever, cough, and sputum with respiratory infections; urticaria with anaphylaxis; and wheezing with acute bronchospasm. However, dyspnea may be the sole complaint. In these cases, attention to historical information and a review of this limited differential diagnosis are important. The approach to acute dyspnea is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exertional and nocturnal dyspnea</strong> &ndash; Chronic exertional dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) are both associated with heart failure, although nocturnal dyspnea is more specific to heart failure. Asthma is also associated with exertional and nocturnal dyspnea, but unlike PND does not usually improve with sitting or standing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dyspnea that is not exacerbated by exertion is more often due to a functional or perceptual problem, than cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermittent dyspnea</strong> &ndash; Intermittent dyspnea associated with cold air or animal dander exposure suggests asthma; work-related dyspnea may suggest occupational asthma; and dyspnea following upper respiratory infections may be due to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to asthma, intermittent symptoms that resolve completely between episodes can be seen with recurrent aspiration; recurrent pulmonary emboli and heart failure can also wax and wane, but generally leave a baseline level of dysfunction. The presence of specific, reproducible inciting events such as exercise or cold air exposure is common with airways hyperreactivity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapidity of symptom onset and progression</strong> &ndash; The rapidity with which symptoms develop during exercise can also provide useful diagnostic information. For example, patients who develop shortness of breath and wheezing after walking 50 to 100 feet often have acute elevations in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (usually due to cardiac diastolic dysfunction) or pulmonary hypertension. In contrast, symptoms of exercise-induced asthma usually are precipitated by more intense activity, beginning three minutes into exercise, peaking within 10 to 15 minutes, and resolving by 60 minutes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Respiratory muscle weakness generally leads to gradually progressive dyspnea, sometimes with an acute worsening at a time of illness, particularly a respiratory infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456635580\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of dyspnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with chronic dyspnea, formal assessment of the severity of dyspnea can help create a baseline for future comparisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A number of instruments are available to help assess the severity of dyspnea, such as the Baseline Dyspnea Index and the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 2</a>), and the Borg scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456636466\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Associated symptoms such as cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, chest pain, peripheral edema, Raynaud phenomenon, joint swelling, and muscle weakness can help identify areas for further investigation. Asymmetric lower extremity edema might suggest venous thromboembolic disease; Raynaud phenomenon is seen in a number of rheumatic diseases that are associated with interstitial lung disease; and symmetric swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints may be a clue to rheumatoid lung disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456635555\"><span class=\"h2\">Descriptors of breathing discomfort</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attention to the quality or descriptor that a patient associates with the breathing discomfort often provides clues to the underlying diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This observation comes from studies in which dyspnea questionnaires (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76579\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76579 \">table 4</a>) were presented to patients with breathing discomfort from a variety of cardiopulmonary disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/6-8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,25</a>]. Subjects were asked to select the phrases that best described their breathing discomfort, and distinct clusters emerged. While some clusters of phrases were common to a number of disease categories (eg, increased work or effort of breathing was found with COPD, asthma, and neuromuscular disease), each disease had a relatively unique set of clusters associated with it.</p><p>The combined data from studies that were performed in patients with known cardiopulmonary disorders or in normal subjects made breathless under experimental conditions indicate the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69244 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/2,6-8,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8,24,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensation of &quot;air hunger&quot; has been associated with acute hypercapnia in asthma and COPD, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and restricted thoracic motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/3,4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute bronchoconstriction leads to a series of sensations as the degree of obstruction worsens, from &quot;chest tightness&quot; to an increased &quot;effort to breathe&quot; to a sensation of &quot;air hunger&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/6-9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,12,13</a>].

The optimal sequence of diagnostic testing for chronic dyspnea has not been determined. We typically follow an algorithm that utilizes three tiers of testing: initial testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818 \">table 7</a>), follow-up testing based on results of initial tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104821\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104821 \">table 8A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111477 \">table 8B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111478 \">table 8C</a>), and advanced testing if the diagnosis remains uncertain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104824 \">table 9</a>). Within each tier, we select tests based on the patient&rsquo;s clinical features, results of prior tests, and likelihood of a diagnostic result. One study found that the most informative tests for adults (age 45 to 84) with dyspnea and no known cardiopulmonary disease were the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) obtained by spirometry, the N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and percent emphysema on chest computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1417201611\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After reviewing the clinical findings for patterns that appear suggestive of one or two of the above five most common processes, the narrowed differential diagnosis is used to select tests that focus on these possibilities. As an example, if the patient is age 20 to 40 and has a clinical picture of allergic rhinitis and intermittent dyspnea, the initial testing might be limited to spirometry pre and post bronchodilator. Similarly, a 70 year old patient with known coronary artery disease, peripheral edema, and no smoking history might be evaluated for heart failure with an electrocardiogram, a serum NT-proBNP, and echocardiogram before considering spirometry. </p><p>If the clinical evaluation doesn&rsquo;t allow narrowing of the differential we usually obtain the following &quot;initial tests&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818 \">table 7</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (to exclude anemia): The degree of dyspnea associated with anemia may depend on the rapidity of blood loss and the degree of exertion that the patient undertakes.

When intrathoracic airflow limitation is noted or when a diagnosis of asthma is suspected, postbronchodilator spirometry determines whether there is reversibility of airflow limitation. Typically in asthma, airflow limitation is reversible, although a large component of airways edema and inflammation may need a course of inhaled or oral glucocorticoid therapy to achieve complete reversibility. Patients with a clinical suspicion of asthma and reversible airflow limitation on spirometry would be managed with a trial of specific therapy for asthma. Patients with a smoking history longer than 20 years and irreversible airflow limitation on spirometry are usually managed with a presumptive diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, other causes of irreversible airflow limitation (eg, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, central airway obstruction) should be considered if the patient does not respond to empiric therapy for asthma or COPD.

A pleural effusion will need a directed evaluation as to the cause (eg, benign asbestos effusion, malignancy, trapped lung, rheumatoid effusion, infection, heart failure), usually including thoracentesis. Kyphoscoliosis identified on chest radiograph (and physical examination) is typically evaluated with full pulmonary function tests to determine the likelihood of hypercapnia.

The possibility of an underlying &quot;restrictive&quot; abnormality is assessed with measurement of lung volumes, looking for a similar decrease in total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. A restrictive pattern may be caused by interstitial lung disease, pleural disease (eg, trapped lung), chest wall disease (eg, kyphoscoliosis), or ventilatory muscle weakness (eg, diffuse or due to diaphragmatic paralysis). Respiratory muscle weakness can be evaluated further with maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures at the mouth, maximal voluntary ventilation in one minute, and supine spirometry that is compared with sitting spirometry results.

A trial of therapy for asthma is an alternative, but bronchoprovocation is preferred to enable a precise determination of asthma. Empiric therapy can lead to gradual acceleration of treatment, including use of systemic glucocorticoids, with attendant side effects if the patient does not have asthma.

Pulmonary vascular disease (eg, pulmonary hypertension, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease) is suggested by the combination of normal spirometry and lung volumes, but abnormal gas transfer manifest by a decrease in DLCO and pulse oxygen saturation on exertion (eg, &ge;5 percent).

Other patients, who do not feel that deconditioning is contributory, may wish to proceed directly to additional testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H809968762\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiopulmonary exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) can be helpful when the etiology of a patient's dyspnea remains unclear after the evaluation described above or when dyspnea seems out of proportion to the severity of the patient's known cardiac or pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/1,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,43,44</a>]. A CPET can assess the workload that the patient can achieve, the degree of dyspnea experienced (eg, Borg or other visual scale), the peak oxygen uptake, cardiac output (calculated from carbon dioxide production and oxygen uptake), and relationship of minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional exercise testing: Ventilatory gas analysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In particular, CPET may help identify patients with mitochondrial disorders (eg, McArdle&rsquo;s myophosphorylase deficiency, isolated mitochondrial myopathy) by demonstrating a reduction in maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max), reduced peripheral oxygen extraction (increased mixed venous oxygen), and an increase in blood lactate after exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H706414578\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Exercise testing'</a>.) </p><p>A CPET may be helpful in providing support for the presence of deconditioning or in detecting a low threshold for respiratory discomfort. Patients with a low threshold for respiratory discomfort typically terminate the test at mild workloads because of dyspnea, but have no evidence of cardiopulmonary abnormality. In patients with both pulmonary and cardiac disease, either of which could cause the patient to have dyspnea limiting their exercise capacity, CPET may assist in the determination of the actual cause of the limitation. (See <a href=\"#H545770877\" class=\"local\">'Chronic dyspnea with a normal evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H809968769\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with pulmonary artery catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with pulmonary artery catheterization, also known as an invasive CPET or iCPET, is performed at specialized centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The role of iCPET in the evaluation of dyspnea has not been clearly defined. Typically, it is used in the evaluation of exercise-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension, exercise-induced heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF), and preload dependent limitations to cardiac output. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545770877\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC DYSPNEA WITH A NORMAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasional patients with chronic dyspnea will go through a complete evaluation without identification of a cause. Others may have near normal testing, such that a slight decrease in peak oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold, and peak heart rate are thought to be most consistent with deconditioning or obesity. While obese patients frequently report dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], in a given individual it can be difficult to know how much dyspnea is attributable to obesity. For patients who report dyspnea but have normal or near normal testing, we explain the reassuring nature of testing in detail, advise a conditioning program, and ask the patient to return in 6 to 12 months for re-evaluation. The re-evaluation is important due to the infrequent situation in which a treatable cause of dyspnea is missed initially, but becomes apparent on subsequent testing. </p><p>Dyspnea due to obesity per se is commonly associated with a sense of increased effort to breathe or work of breathing, likely due to the reduced compliance of the chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Hypoxemia, either at rest or with exertion, may be caused by <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatching at the bases of the lungs, a consequence of narrowing of airways in these regions due to the weight of the chest wall. </p><p>Other chest symptoms (eg, heartburn) and psychological factors can lead to the perception of dyspnea, as described below. Use of a Borg scale during cardiopulmonary exercise testing will sometimes identify dyspnea associated with a low work load and normal cardiorespiratory function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981 \">table 3</a>).

In a study of laboratory-induced dyspnea, air hunger was associated with greater unpleasantness for a given level of sensory intensity than was the sense of respiratory work or effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The context in which a sensation occurs may alter the affective component of the intensity and needs to be considered when assessing the patient.</p><p>For a given physiologic derangement that may cause dyspnea, perceptual responses vary widely among individuals. Anxiety, anger, pain, and depression may be associated with dyspnea intensity out of proportion to the physiologic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. Increased ventilation associated with anxiety, anger, or pain may push an individual with a limited pulmonary reserve at baseline closer to his or her ventilatory limits and increase the perceived respiratory discomfort for any given activity.</p><p>To the extent that dyspnea occurs unexpectedly or cannot be quickly relieved, it may give rise to a range of emotional reactions, which can then lead to further physiological derangements (eg, tachypnea, hyperinflation). For any given gas exchange or mechanical problem with the cardiopulmonary system, the emotional or affective response may contribute to the intensity or discomfort of the sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]; questionnaires are now in development that incorporate both qualitative and affective descriptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea/abstract/49,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,54,55</a>].</p><p>Patients with hyperventilation syndrome typically experience a sensation of air hunger or an inability to take a deep breath in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease. These individuals may have panic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety disorders, and on examination are often observed to breathe with very large tidal volumes despite the complaint that they cannot take a deep enough breath.

Dyspnea is considered acute when it develops over hours to days and chronic when it has been present for more than four to eight weeks. (See <a href=\"#H456635518\" class=\"local\">'Definition of dyspnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea can be the first manifestation of a variety of cardiopulmonary disorders. It is not uncommon for a patient to have more than one problem contributing to breathing discomfort. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history and physical examination lead to accurate diagnoses in patients with dyspnea in approximately two-thirds of cases. Important components of the history include the characteristics of dyspnea (ie, timing, severity, and triggers), exposures that may contribute to the lung disease (eg, allergens, cold air, occupational agents, cigarette smoke), and interventions or medications that reduce dyspnea. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient&rsquo;s description of breathing discomfort can help narrow down diagnostic possibilities. In addition, the presence of more than one type of breathing discomfort can lead to recognition that more than one disease process is contributing to dyspnea. (See <a href=\"#H456635555\" class=\"local\">'Descriptors of breathing discomfort'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing discomfort arising over the course of minutes to hours (acute dyspnea) generally requires prompt evaluation and treatment. The evaluation of acute dyspnea is described separately. (See <a href=\"#H457809579\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of acute dyspnea'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the many causes of chronic dyspnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104817 \">table 6</a>), the most common are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, cardiomyopathy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">obesity/deconditioning</span>. In addition, deconditioning is often a contributing factor in patients with chronic lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H456636849\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing in chronic dyspnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating chronic dyspnea, we follow a step-wise diagnostic approach of initial testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818 \">table 7</a>), follow-up testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104821%7EPULM%2F111477%7EPULM%2F111478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104821 graphicRef111477 graphicRef111478 \">table 8A-C</a>), and advanced testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104824 \">table 9</a>), starting with the tests that are the least invasive and most likely to yield a diagnosis. Within each tier, the individual tests are selected based on the patient&rsquo;s clinical features, results of prior tests, and response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H456636849\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing in chronic dyspnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial tests are selected based on a review of the clinical findings for patterns suggestive of one or two of the above five most common causes of dyspnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818 \">table 7</a>). When asthma or COPD is suspected, the initial testing might be limited to spirometry pre and post bronchodilator, while an older patient with coronary artery disease and peripheral edema should be evaluated for heart failure before considering spirometry. (See <a href=\"#H456636849\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing in chronic dyspnea'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up testing in the evaluation of dyspnea should clarify abnormalities that were noted on initial testing, but were not diagnostic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104821\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104821 \">table 8A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111477 \">table 8B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111478 \">table 8C</a>). In addition, some patients with normal results on initial testing, but persistent symptoms, require further evaluation. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) is generally reserved for patients in whom there is a suspicion of interstitial lung disease, occult emphysema, or chronic thromboembolic disease. Echocardiography is useful for evaluating suspected left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H457809762\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up testing in chronic dyspnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced testing includes procedures such as right heart catheterization, stress echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), and invasive CPET (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104824 \">table 9</a>). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a useful study in patients in whom the cause of their breathing discomfort remains elusive after standard testing, in patients in whom deconditioning is a serious consideration, and in patients who appear to have breathing discomfort out of proportion to their physiologic derangements.
