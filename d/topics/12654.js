In the United States, lung cancer occurs in approximately 234,000 patients and causes over 154,000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Both the absolute and relative frequency of lung cancer has risen dramatically. Around 1953, lung cancer became the most common cause of cancer deaths in men, and in 1985, it became the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Lung cancer deaths have begun to decline in both men and women, reflecting a decrease in smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=women-and-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Women and lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The term lung cancer, or bronchogenic carcinoma, refers to malignancies that originate in the airways or pulmonary parenchyma. Approximately 95 percent of all lung cancers are classified as either small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This distinction is essential for staging, treatment, and prognosis. Other cell types comprise approximately 5 percent of malignancies arising in the lung.</p><p>This discussion will present an overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of NSCLC and SCLC. An overview of the initial evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of lung cancer is presented separately.

The risk factors associated with the development of lung cancer are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary risk factor for the development of lung cancer is cigarette smoking, which is estimated to account for approximately 90 percent of all lung cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk of developing lung cancer for a current smoker of one pack per day for 40 years is approximately 20 times that of someone who has never smoked. Factors that increase the risk of developing lung cancer in smokers include the extent of smoking and exposure to other carcinogenic factors, such as asbestos.</p><p>Thus, the most important aspects of lung cancer prevention are preventing people from starting to smoke and inducing those who already smoke to stop. In individuals who do quit smoking, the risk of developing lung cancer falls compared with those who continue to smoke; the benefit is greatest in those who stop by age 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Despite stopping smoking, the risk for lung cancer continues to rise with age at a faster rate than those who never smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This increased risk has been demonstrated in patients with both Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer.

Attempts to confirm these epidemiologic findings and to decrease the incidence of lung cancer in high-risk patients have not been successful. As an example, the Alpha-Tocopherol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beta-Carotene</a> Cancer Prevention Study actually showed an increase in lung cancer among smokers with dietary supplementation of beta-carotene.

Screening for lung cancer was not widely used until recently because chest radiography and sputum cytology had not been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer.</p><p>Prospective, single-arm observational studies have shown that a large percentage of lung cancers detected by computed tomography (CT) screening are early stage tumors, which have a favorable prognosis. These findings led to the randomized National Lung Screening Trial that compared CT screening with chest x-ray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This trial demonstrated a 20 percent decrease in lung cancer mortality in heavy smokers who were screened annually for three years and is the only trial to show benefit in mortality reduction.</p><p>The US Preventative Services Task Force has given low-dose CT scanning a &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation for those at high risk for lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has agreed to cover the cost of CT screening in approved programs for those age 55 to 77 who have no symptoms of lung cancer, have a 30 pack-year smoking history, and if they have quit have done so within 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relative incidence of adenocarcinoma has risen dramatically, and there has been a corresponding decrease in the incidence of other types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The increased incidence of adenocarcinoma is thought to be due to the introduction of low-tar filter cigarettes in the 1960s, although this relationship is unproven.</p><p>Until recent years the simple pathologic separation of NSCLC from SCLC along with stage was adequate to make treatment decisions for a new diagnosis of lung cancer. Since 2008, it has been shown that separation of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is important in determining optimal therapy for stage IV disease. The development of targeted therapy for specific gene mutations has resulted in the reality of individually tailored therapy. Subtype analysis of NSCLC has come full circle now that epidermal growth factor receptors (<em>EGFR</em>), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<em>ALK</em>), and c-ROS oncogene 1 (<em>ROS1</em>) mutations are not only identifiable but their targeted treatment results in responses better than that with standard chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The <em>ALK</em> gene mutations present in 2 to 7 percent of United States patients with NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The improved response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific to these mutations has led the College of American Pathologists Guideline to recommend testing for <em>EGFR</em> and <em>ALK</em> mutations in all advanced-stage adenocarcinomas, mixed cancers, and those with NSCLC in whom an adenocarcinoma component cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Using multiplexed assays one group identified driver mutations in over 60 percent of more than 700 patients with adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The potential for mutation identification and tailored treatment has implications at the initial evaluation of suspected lung cancer as diagnostic sampling needs to be adequate to be assessed for mutation if advanced stage adenocarcinoma is present. Over 90 percent of samples from endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle aspirates, transthoracic needle aspirates, and pleural fluid cytology specimens showing adenocarcinoma are adequate for mutation analysis; however, adequacy rates are lower from bone biopsy aspirates that require decalcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with lung cancer have advanced disease at clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76229\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76229 \">table 1</a>). This may reflect the aggressive biology of the disease and the frequent absence of symptoms until locally advanced or metastatic disease is present. Many high-risk patients will be diagnosed while asymptomatic due to an effective screening test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms may result from local effects of the tumor, from regional or distant spread, or from distant effects not related to metastases (paraneoplastic syndromes). Approximately three-fourths of non-screened patients have one or more symptoms at the time of diagnosis. A study of 2293 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) noted that the mean age was 64 years and the most common symptoms at presentation were cough (55 percent), dyspnea (45 percent), pain (38 percent), and weight loss (36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrathoracic effects of the cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a wide range of symptoms due to the intrathoracic effects of the cancer, the most common of which are cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and dyspnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355281935\"><span class=\"h3\">Cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough is present in 50 to 75 percent of lung cancer patients at presentation and occurs most frequently in patients with squamous cell and small cell carcinomas because of their tendency to involve central airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The new onset of cough in a smoker or former smoker should raise suspicion that lung cancer is present. Bronchorrhea or cough productive of large volumes of thin, mucoid secretions may be a feature of mucinous adenocarcinoma and usually indicates advanced disease. Both NSCLC and SCLC may cause a post-obstructive pneumonia. However, bronchiectasis from bronchial obstruction is uncommon because lung cancer usually progresses too rapidly for bronchiectasis to develop. In contrast, slow-growing neoplasms such as carcinoid tumor or hamartoma are more likely to present with bronchiectasis.

Any amount of hemoptysis can be alarming to the patient, and large volumes of hemoptysis may cause asphyxia. In a patient with hemoptysis, the likelihood of lung cancer varies from 3 to 34 percent in different series depending upon the patient's age and smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In smokers with hemoptysis and a nonsuspicious or normal chest radiograph, bronchoscopy will diagnose lung cancer in approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

It can be quite variable in character and is more common in younger compared with older patients. Pain is typically present on the same side of the chest as the primary tumor. Dull, aching, persistent pain may occur from mediastinal, pleural, or chest wall extension, but the presence of pain does not necessarily preclude resectability. Although pleuritic pain may be the result of direct pleural involvement, obstructive pneumonitis or a pulmonary embolus related to a hypercoagulable state may also cause chest pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355281956\"><span class=\"h3\">Dyspnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shortness of breath is a common symptom in patients with lung cancer at the time of diagnosis, occurring in approximately 25 to 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Dyspnea may be due to extrinsic or intraluminal airway obstruction, obstructive pneumonitis or atelectasis, lymphangitic tumor spread, tumor emboli, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion with tamponade. Partial obstruction of a bronchus may cause a localized wheeze, heard by the patient or by the clinician on auscultation, while stridor can result from obstruction of larger airways.</p><p>Pulmonary function testing may be useful in a patient with dyspnea when due to lung cancer, as it may show flattening of the expiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inspiratory flow-volume loop from presence of tumor in the trachea itself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57161\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57161 \">figure 1</a>), from extrinsic compression, or from vocal cord paralysis.

Although malignant pleural effusions can cause dyspnea and cough, approximately one-fourth of patients who have lung cancer and pleural metastases are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although a malignant pleural effusion precludes curative resection, not all pleural effusions in patients with lung cancer are malignant. A benign pleural effusion may occur in a patient with a resectable lung cancer due to lymphatic obstruction, post-obstructive pneumonitis, or atelectasis. In a patient with a pleural effusion, the presence of tumor needs to be confirmed or excluded so that a chance for curative resection is not missed. Series report that 5 to 14 percent of patients with NSCLC and an ipsilateral pleural effusion have resectable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Surgical thoracoscopy or medical pleuroscopy should follow two or three negative cytologies to further evaluate the pleural space prior to surgical resection of a primary lesion.</p><p>Malignant effusions are typically exudates and may be serous, serosanguineous, or grossly bloody. The yield of pleural fluid cytology after a single thoracentesis in patients with documented pleural involvement is approximately 60 percent; the yield rises to approximately 75 percent with a second thoracentesis and there is little additional gain with additional thoracentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].Closed pleural biopsy adds little to the yield of cytologic examination. In a patient with a suspected malignancy, repeat pleural fluid cytology with or without pleural biopsy is appropriate if the initial study is negative. A prospective series evaluated cytologic yield from pleural fluid aliquots of 10 mL, 60 mL, and &ge;150 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Concern about adrenal metastasis usually occurs when a unilateral mass is found by staging CT in a patient with a known or suspected lung cancer. Only a fraction of adrenal masses detected on staging scans represent metastasis. This was illustrated by a series of 330 patients with operable NSCLC, in which 32 (10 percent) had an isolated adrenal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Only 8 of these 32 (25 percent) were malignant while the remainder had benign lesions (adenomas, nodular hyperplasia, hemorrhagic cysts). Conversely, a negative imaging study does not exclude adrenal metastases. A study of patients with SCLC found that 17 percent of adrenal biopsies showed metastatic involvement despite having a normal CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The lack of specificity of an initial CT identifying an adrenal mass creates a special problem in patients with an otherwise resectable lung cancer.

These inflammatory myopathies can be the presenting symptom in patients with lung cancer or can develop later in the course of disease. In addition to lung cancer, other frequent primary sites associated with these disorders include the ovary, cervix, pancreas, bladder, and stomach. The incidence of malignancy and the role of screening for cancer in patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis is discussed elsewhere.
