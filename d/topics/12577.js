Phosphorus intake above 4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> causes only small elevations in serum phosphate concentrations as long as the intake is distributed over the course of the day. If, however, an acute phosphate load is given over several hours, transient hyperphosphatemia will ensue. </p><p>The diagnostic approach to hyperphosphatemia involves elucidating why phosphate entry into the extracellular fluid exceeds the degree to which it can be excreted or why the renal threshold for phosphate excretion is increased above normal. There are four general circumstances in which this occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F89978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89978 \">table 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute phosphate load</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute extracellular shift of phosphate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or chronic kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary increase in tubular phosphate reabsorption</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute phosphate load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A phosphate load sufficient to overwhelm renal capacity for excretion can be derived from either endogenous or exogenous sources. Since phosphate is the major intracellular anion, any cause of marked tissue breakdown can lead to release of intracellular phosphate into the extracellular fluid. The ensuing hyperphosphatemia may then induce potentially symptomatic hypocalcemia due to calcium-phosphate precipitation in the tissues. Examples of marked tissue breakdown include tumor lysis syndrome, muscle necrosis (rhabdomyolysis), and, rarely, marked hemolysis or transfusion of stored blood. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor lysis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor lysis syndrome is most often caused by cytotoxic therapy (but can occasionally occur spontaneously) in patients with a large burden of a tumor characterized by rapid cell turnover, such as lymphomas (particularly Burkitt lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and certain leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to release of phosphate, this syndrome is also associated with the release of potassium, purines (which can be metabolized to uric acid), and cell proteins (which can be metabolized to urea). Thus, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia (which may lead to acute renal failure), and azotemia are other common metabolic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

The severity of the hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia may be increased if heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) ensues. In these patients, resolution of the renal injury can lead to hypercalcemia as the serum phosphate concentration falls and the tissue calcium-phosphate deposits are mobilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H25399006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Exogenous phosphate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperphosphatemia from exogenous sources is most commonly induced by the ingestion of large amounts of phosphate-containing laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Fleet's Phospho-Soda (which is no longer available over the counter), for example, contains 4.25 mmol of inorganic phosphate per mL. As a result, 20 mL taken over three to six hours can cause severe, even fatal, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Less commonly, hyperphosphatemia has been reported in patients receiving high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a> for the treatment of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In addition to absorption of the excess phosphate associated with phosphate-containing laxatives, volume contraction (due to diarrhea) and mild renal insufficiency (due to decreased renal perfusion) may contribute to hyperphosphatemia in this setting. A review of the literature suggests that patients with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at particularly high risk for hyperphosphatemia due to phosphate-containing medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Acute phosphate nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of reports describing acute or subacute kidney injury (called acute phosphate nephropathy or phosphate nephropathy) occurring after the ingestion of sodium-phosphate laxatives (solution or tablets) as bowel preparation for colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

In addition to promoting a shift of phosphate out of cells, metabolic acidosis can diminish glycolysis and therefore cellular phosphate utilization, resulting in an increase in the serum phosphate. </p><p>For unclear reasons, other forms of acidosis are less likely to be associated with hyperphosphatemia. In the case of lactic acidosis, concurrent tissue hypoxia and cell death is likely to further contribute to a decreased consumption and increased release of phosphate from cells. In the case of diabetic ketoacidosis, decreased cellular phosphate uptake due to insulin deficiency may contribute to the hyperphosphatemia. However, such patients are usually phosphate depleted, resulting from phosphaturia associated with the osmotic diuresis induced by hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The phosphate deficiency in these patients will typically be unmasked (leading to hypophosphatemia) by the administration of insulin.

Only 5 to 20 percent of the filtered phosphorus is normally excreted, with most being reabsorbed in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Nevertheless, phosphate balance can initially be maintained in such patients by decreasing proximal phosphate reabsorption under the influence of increased secretion of PTH and FGF23. Once the GFR falls below 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> however, phosphate reabsorption is thought to be maximally suppressed, and urinary excretion may no longer keep pace with phosphate intake. At this point, hyperphosphatemia occurs, increasing the filtered load and reestablishing phosphate balance.

These patients also have hypocalcemia due to reduced bone resorption and urinary calcium losses.

How this occurs is not clear, although two potential mechanisms include the following: calcium and vitamin D therapy increase the serum calcium concentration, which may directly diminish phosphate transport in the proximal tubule; calcitriol stimulates FGF23 production by bone, which could lead to a suppression of phosphate reabsorption by the proximal tubule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Acromegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperphosphatemia occurs in some patients with acromegaly.

The underlying defect that was first described was a mutation in the GALNT3 gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase that is thought to prevent the degradation of FGF23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

It is postulated that inactivating mutations in either the GALNT3 or FGF23 genes could lead to deficiency of circulating intact FGF23, which is a promoter of renal phosphate excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, FGF23 requires Klotho to bind to its receptor; therefore, a deficiency in Klotho could lead to a state of FGF23 end-organ resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

The tendency of phosphate to complex with calcium and cause hypocalcemia appears to be counterbalanced by increased production of 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D and perhaps hyperphosphatemia-induced stimulation of calcium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The combination of hyperphosphatemia and normocalcemia results in a high calcium-phosphate product and calcium-phosphate deposition in the skin and subcutaneous tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Lowering the serum phosphate concentration by dietary restriction and phosphate binders, which impair intestinal phosphate absorption, often results in resolution of these deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia/abstract/23,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33</a>].
