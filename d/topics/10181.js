The lymphatic system is made up of organs all over the body that make and store cells that fight infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63854 \">figure 1</a>). These infection-fighting cells are also called &ldquo;white blood cells.&rdquo;</p><p>When people have lymphoma, their white blood cells become abnormal and grow out of control. These cells can travel to different parts of the body. Often, the abnormal cells collect in small, bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. This causes the lymph nodes to swell. </p><p>There are different types of lymphoma. Some types grow very slowly. Other types grow much faster. Sometimes, people start out with a slow-growing type of lymphoma that later becomes fast-growing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280779\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first sign of lymphoma is often one or more large, swollen lymph nodes. These swollen lymph nodes can be felt under the skin, but are usually not painful. They are often in the neck, groin, armpit, or stomach. </p><p>Lymph nodes deeper in the body can also become swollen and cause symptoms. For example, swollen lymph nodes around the lungs can cause a cough or trouble breathing.</p><p>Other symptoms of lymphoma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night sweats that soak your clothes</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not lymphoma. But if you have these symptoms, you should let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280786\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. He or she might order other tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node biopsy &ndash; A doctor will remove all or part of the swollen lymph node. Another doctor will look at cells from the lymph node under a microscope to see if cancer is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy &ndash; A doctor will take a small sample of bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue in the center of some bones. Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other biopsy &ndash; A doctor might remove a small sample of other abnormal tissues in the body. These samples are also checked under a microscope for cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan, PET scan, or other imaging tests &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of your body and can show abnormal growths.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280793\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lymphoma staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoma staging is a way in which doctors find out how far lymphoma has spread within the lymphatic system or within the body. </p><p>The right treatment for you will depend, in part, on the stage of your lymphoma. Your treatment will also depend on the type of lymphoma you have, your age, and your other health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280800\"><span class=\"h1\">How is lymphoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat lymphoma in different ways. People with some forms of lymphoma get treated right away. But people with lymphoma that is growing slowly and not causing symptoms often do not need treatment at first.</p><p>People with lymphoma often have one or more of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunotherapy</strong> &ndash; These are medicines that kill cancer cells by recognizing the cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;)</strong> &ndash; This treatment replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation.<strong> </strong></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280807\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the lymphoma comes back. Regular follow up will include talking with your doctor and having exams. Sometimes, your doctor will also do blood tests and imaging tests. Plus, you should watch for the symptoms listed above, because having those symptoms could mean the cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280814\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the lymphoma comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the lymphoma comes back, you might have more chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, or a bone marrow transplant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280821\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctors' instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment. </p><p>Getting treated for lymphoma involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when. </p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks to this treatment? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541280828\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
