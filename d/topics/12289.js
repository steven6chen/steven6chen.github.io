Both loss of vessel integrity leading to bleeding, and compromise of the lumen may result in downstream tissue ischemia and necrosis. In general, affected vessels vary in size, type, and location in association with the specific type of vasculitis. Vasculitis may occur as a primary process or may be secondary to another underlying disease. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these diseases are unknown.</p><p>The vasculitides are often serious and sometimes fatal diseases that require prompt recognition and therapy. Symptomatic involvement of affected organs may reflect single or multiple organ disease. The distribution of affected organs may suggest a particular type of vasculitis.</p><p>This topic will review the nomenclature of the different vasculitides and provide an overview of the approach to the patient with suspected vasculitis. An overview of the treatment of these disorders and detailed discussions of the individual disorders are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-vasculitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of vasculitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease names and definitions of the vasculitides continue to evolve as our understanding of the pathogenesis advances. The international Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) has developed one of the most widely used nomenclature systems which specifies the names and definitions for most forms of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The CHCC nomenclature system has changed over the past few decades, and definitions that were put forth by the CHCC in 1994 have since been revised in the 2012 CHCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90188 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90189 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Among the notable changes in the 2012 CHCC was the preferential use and adoption of new names for several diseases, consistent with the trend of replacing eponyms with disease names that reflect an increased pathophysiologic understanding of these conditions. Among the name changes are: eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), abbreviated EGPA, in place of Churg-Strauss syndrome; granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), abbreviated GPA, in place of Wegener's granulomatosis; immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein), abbreviated as IgAV, in place of Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (HSP); anti-C1q vasculitis as an alternative name for hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, abbreviated HUV; and use of the term &quot;cryoglobulinemic vasculitis&quot; in place of &quot;essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.&quot; Furthermore, the 2012 CHCC formally adopted the term antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) for the group of three disorders that include microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA, with additional categories also named to describe variable-vessel vasculitis and secondary forms of vasculitis. This nomenclature system is not meant to substitute for classification criteria, which include clinical observations that classify a specific patient into a category for a research purposes. (See <a href=\"#H262396967\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199990548\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR CATEGORIES OF VASCULITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classification of the noninfectious vasculitides is primarily based upon the predominant size of the vessels involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96750\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96750 \">figure 1</a>), although there may be some overlap in the size of arteries involved with all these diseases. Thus, large-vessel vasculitis, as its name suggests, mostly affects large arteries. The same principle is true for the medium- and small-vessel vasculitides in which medium-vessel vasculitis predominantly affects medium arteries and small-vessel vasculitis predominantly affects small arteries and capillaries. The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) also recognizes that some forms of vasculitis do not involve a single predominant size of vessel (variable-vessel vasculitis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Large-vessel vasculitis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Takayasu arteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Takayasu arteritis primarily affects the aorta and its major branches. The inflammation and damage is often localized to a portion of the affected vessels, but extensive involvement such as nearly pan-aortitis can be seen. The onset of disease usually occurs before the age of 30 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Giant cell arteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, predominantly affects the aorta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its major branches, with a predilection for the branches of the carotid including the superficial temporal artery. The onset of disease usually occurs in patients older than 50, with markedly increased incidence in the eighth and ninth decades of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are other forms of large-vessel vasculitis that either do not have a specific name, such as idiopathic isolated aortitis, or are part of another form of vasculitis or systemic inflammatory condition, such as Cogan's syndrome or relapsing polychondritis.

The disease usually occurs in children and is often associated with a mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. The coronary arteries may also be involved. A small number of cases have also been reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

AAV predominantly affects small vessels and is associated with ANCA specific for myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) or proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Cases of ANCA-negative AAV do occur, especially in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) but also to some extent in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). ANCA-negative AAV describes cases in which the patient otherwise fulfills the definition for AAV but has negative results on serologic testing for ANCA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major clinicopathologic variants of AAV include microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA; additionally, AAV can occur in only a single organ, especially a subset referred to as renal-limited AAV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262394541\"><span class=\"h4\">Microscopic polyangiitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPA is a necrotizing vasculitis that primarily affects capillaries, venules, or arterioles, most commonly manifesting as necrotizing glomerulonephritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary capillaritis. Involvement of medium- and small- sized arteries may also be present. Granulomatous inflammation is usually absent. ANCA is present in &gt;90 percent of patients with MPA.

It typically produces granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. ANCA is present in &gt;80 percent of patients with GPA.

Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that ANCA type (anti-MPO or anti-PR3) has more prognostic and clinical meaning rather than the disease type (MPA or GPA), leading some experts to refer to MPO-AAV or PR3-AAV, and many clinical trials in AAV now stratify enrollment by ANCA type (MPO or PR3) and report results for each subgroup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262394573\"><span class=\"h4\">Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EGPA is an eosinophilic-rich necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affecting small- to medium-sized vessels. Patients often have chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia. ANCA is present in approximately 40 percent of patients with EGPA, usually anti-MPO ANCA. The presence of ANCA is more frequent in patients with glomerulonephritis.

In this disorder, which is most often due to hepatitis C virus infection, cryoglobulin immune complexes are deposited in the walls of capillaries, venules, or arterioles, thereby resulting in inflammation in small vessels. Skin, glomeruli, and peripheral nerves are often involved.

Glomerulonephritis, arthritis, obstructive pulmonary disease, and ocular inflammation may also be observed. The presence of anti-C1q antibodies is one of the most distinctive findings in HUV, and consideration of the name anti-C1q vasculitis for this entity has been suggested.

The involved organ and vessel type should be included in the name (eg, primary central nervous system vasculitis [CNSV], cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, isolated aortitis). Some patients initially diagnosed with single-organ vasculitis may develop other disease manifestations, warranting reevaluation for another systemic vasculitis (eg, cutaneous arteritis later becoming polyarteritis nodosa).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262394502\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary central nervous system vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary CNSV, or primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS), refers to vasculitis affecting the medium and small blood vessels of the brain, spinal cord, and the meninges, without systemic (non-brain) involvement.

Examples include hepatitis C virus-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, hepatitis B virus-associated polyarteritis nodosa, and hydralazine-associated ANCA-associated vasculitis. Hematologic and solid organ neoplasms as well as clonal B cell lymphoproliferative disorders can also be associated with vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262396967\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification of the vasculitides has been a challenging problem for decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) proposed criteria for several types of vasculitis as a means of categorizing patients for clinical research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. While these criteria can be used to help inform the diagnosis, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The 1990 classification criteria can be found on <a href=\"http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Criteria/ACR-Endorsed-Criteria&amp;token=262wb3+BaRYoZfi6P9rnllxC06WPkubtAinvwX4A6zTgwMGRmQS7GMGWdU5KoAun/BpPIBc5OX6nt0L8eSTmTvty9m0/na9E4MCxN1h2IwIORE/HnDy/BNC5tiZhQYWD&amp;TOPIC_ID=8226\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American College of Rheumatology</a> website.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) later developed an algorithm that was designed to help classify the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides as well as polyarteritis nodosa for epidemiological studies, but also has its limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The EMA algorithm is discussed in detail separately.

With an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of vasculitis and improved laboratory testing, the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) are in the process of making an international effort to develop revised classification criteria and diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES SUGGESTIVE OF SYSTEMIC VASCULITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not possible to outline a single algorithm for evaluating patients suspected of having any one of the vasculitides because of the clinical heterogeneity of these diseases. Nevertheless, there are some elements of the medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation that may be helpful when trying to identify a patient suspected of having a vasculitis. While each form of vasculitis is rare, the potential for severe organ damage or death from these diseases means it is appropriate to consider the possibility early in the evaluation of patients with any possible manifestations of vasculitis.</p><p>In general, the presence of vasculitis should be considered in patients who present with systemic or constitutional symptoms in combination with evidence of single <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiorgan dysfunction, and especially with some key manifestations as outlined below.

A history of eye inflammation, particularly scleritis, are features sometimes observed in vasculitis. Persistent nasal crusting, epistaxis, or other upper airway disease is suggestive of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The presence of acute foot drop or wrist drop may be due to a motor neuropathy from an ischemic process. Limb claudication, especially in the upper extremities or in a person at low risk for atherosclerosis, is suggestive of a large arterial occlusion from Takayasu arteritis or giant cell arteritis (GCA).</p><p>Unexplained hemoptysis should always raise concern for alveolar hemorrhage and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Similarly, any patients with suspected glomerulonephritis must be evaluated for possible vasculitis, especially AAV or anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease. The combination of lung hemorrhage and renal insufficiency should immediately raise concern for vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A detailed history is also important to assess whether the patient has recently (up to at least some time in the prior 6 to 12 months) been exposed to specific medications or cocaine which may be associated with drug-induced vasculitis, has a history of hepatitis, or has been diagnosed with any disorder known to be associated with a vasculitis (such as systemic lupus erythematosus).

Certain findings, such as diminished sensation to touch and motor weakness of the extremities due to neuropathic changes consistent with mononeuritis multiplex and palpable purpura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51770 \">picture 1</a>), are highly suggestive of an underlying vasculitic process.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings of a sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motor neuropathy &ndash; Both subtle and extensive neuropathies can occur in many forms of vasculitis. These include classical mononeuritis multiplex and peripheral symmetric or asymmetric polyneuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura &ndash; Palpable purpura is a strong sign of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51770 \">picture 1</a>) and is a common finding in many small-vessel vasculitides as well as polyarteritis nodosa (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis#H16171977\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous findings'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-retiform-angulated-purpura#H933969\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with retiform (angulated) purpura&quot;, section on 'Vessel wall pathology'</a>). However, it is important to recognize that not all palpable purpura is vasculitis and not all vasculitis in the skin is represented as purpura.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent, diminished, or tender pulses, bruits, or blood pressure discrepancies &ndash; A careful and full vascular examination is extremely helpful in identifying signs of large-vessel vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The vascular examination should include palpation for pulses in multiple areas including, but not limited to, the radial, brachial, carotid, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries, and auscultation for bruits in the regions of the carotid, subclavian, renal, and femoral arteries and the thoracic and abdominal aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some laboratory tests may help identify the type of vasculitis, the degree of organ involvement, or identify another disease. The initial laboratory evaluation of a patient suspected of having vasculitis should include a complete blood cell count (CBC), serum creatinine, liver function studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein (CRP), serologies for viral hepatitis, serum cryoglobulins, and a urinalysis with urinary sediment. Blood cultures should be drawn to help exclude infection (eg, infective endocarditis).</p><p>Additional, more specific laboratory testing that may further aid in the diagnosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibody (ANA) &ndash; A positive ANA test may support the presence of an underlying systemic rheumatic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement &ndash; Low serum complement levels, especially low C4, may be present in mixed cryoglobulinemia and systemic lupus erythematosus but not in most other forms of vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANCA &ndash; Although not fully diagnostic on its own, the presence of ANCA directed against either protease 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) is extremely specific (often &gt;95 percent) for a diagnosis of AAV in patients with some reasonable pre-test suspicion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694793688\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing should be guided by the clinical presentation. Examples of such studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest radiograph or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is indicated in patients with respiratory symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemoptysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography is useful if symptoms of neuromuscular disease are present, such as findings suggestive of a mononeuritis multiplex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture with cerebral spinal fluid analysis should be considered in patients with symptoms suggestive of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary angiitis of the central nervous system in adults&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy examination of the involved tissue is essential for diagnosis of many vasculitides, but is not possible in all cases. For example, a temporal artery biopsy should always be performed in cases of suspected GCA and is a generally a straightforward procedure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporal-artery-biopsy-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporal artery biopsy technique&quot;</a>). Similarly, skin biopsies of purpuric lesions and renal biopsies in patients with suspected glomerulonephritis have high diagnostic yields. However, for patients with suspected Takayasu arteritis, except in cases where surgical repair was conducted, tissue from the aortic arch and its primary branches is not feasible and the diagnosis is based on other clinical and radiographic findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607376360\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiograms, CT angiograms, vascular ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to detect large artery lesions and, especially CT and MRI, have become the standard approach to screening for large-vessel vasculitis. There is increasing adoption of using ultrasound to detect possible giant cell arteritis, especially in countries and centers with the experience and expertise to conduct ultrasound of the temporal arteries. PET is sometimes useful in identifying potential inflammatory disease in the aorta and its branches. However, while more invasive imaging studies generally can be avoided, conventional catheter-based angiography remains an important diagnostic test in some situations. It is important to realize that no angiographic abnormalities are themselves pathognomonic for vasculitis, but they can be used to support a diagnosis when combined with other clinical data. Angiograms of mesenteric or renal arteries in polyarteritis nodosa may show aneurysms, occlusions, and vascular wall irregularities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65987\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65987 \">image 1</a>). By contrast, angiography is unlikely to be helpful in assessing a small-vessel vasculitis because the affected vessels are below the resolution of usual angiograms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nonvasculitic disease processes may present with symptoms and findings that closely mimic various vasculitides. Perhaps most common are systemic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, atherosclerotic disease, drug reactions, and vaso-occlusive processes. Among the most important diseases to exclude are infections and malignancies, since the immunosuppressive therapy could worsen these conditions and a delay in diagnosis can be extremely dangerous. While it is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive list of all possible alternative diagnoses, we present several categories of mimics of vasculitis in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F103725\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103725 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Both loss of vessel integrity leading to bleeding, and compromise of the lumen may result in downstream tissue ischemia and necrosis. In general, affected vessels vary in size, type, and location in association with the specific type of vasculitis. Vasculitis may occur as a primary process or may be secondary to another underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The international Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) has developed one of the most widely used nomenclature systems, which specifies the names and definitions for most forms of vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90189 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classification of the noninfectious vasculitides is primarily based upon the predominant size of the vessels involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96750\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96750 \">figure 1</a>), although some overlap in the size of arteries involved occurs among the major size-based categories.
