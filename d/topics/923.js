This may be recognized by surgical observation or monitoring of intraoperative vocal cord function. In the past, it was common practice to attempt to perform a direct laryngoscopy after extubation in order to confirm that both vocal cords moved normally.

However, bilateral involvement is more serious, since the patient usually experiences stridor and may have complete airway obstruction. Immediate reintubation, and occasionally tracheostomy, may be necessary.</p><p>Injury to the superior laryngeal nerve (in contrast to the recurrent laryngeal nerve) has no effect on postoperative airway status.

Bleeding and hematoma formation may cause venous congestion of airway structures, and airway compromise may develop rapidly due to compression of the trachea or laryngeal edema as the hematoma expands. When surgical bleeding causes airway compromise, emergent re-operation may be required to evacuate the hematoma. Head-up position to lower venous pressures, nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, and systemic steroids may be useful temporizing strategies; however, definitive treatment should not be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>If time permits, the patient should be returned to the operating room; however, rapidly developing airway compromise may require bedside evacuation of the hematoma.

Although rare, prolonged compression may cause atrophy and erosion of cartilaginous tracheal rings. After thyroid resection, the tracheal wall may collapse in an anteroposterior direction, leading to airway obstruction. In our experience, the absence of airflow around the endotracheal tube after deflating the cuff (ie, absence of a &ldquo;cuff leak&rdquo;) may identify those patients at risk for post-extubation airway compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347400683\"><span class=\"h2\">Other complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522754534\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroid storm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If clinical signs of thyroid storm (hyperthermia and tachycardia) develop during surgery, therapeutic measures to treat hyperthyroidism (eg, beta-blocking agents and thioamides) are immediately initiated.
