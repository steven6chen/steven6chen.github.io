However, emergency direct current cardioversion should be performed if the patient is hemodynamically compromised due to a rapid ventricular rate or, perhaps, the lack of atrial contribution to cardiac output. This includes patients with severe acute left heart failure, ongoing myocardial ischemia, or hypotension. However, if hypotension occurs with a slow or moderate ventricular response (&lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min),</span> other causes of hypotension should be sought, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or hypovolemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Adverse hemodynamics in AF'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First episode</strong> &ndash; Patients with new onset or newly recognized atrial fibrillation (AF) are candidates for cardioversion. We believe that most such patients who are symptomatic should have at least one cardioversion attempt, as the likelihood of success will be high and the natural history of the disease may be such that sinus rhythm will be maintained for a relatively long period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Comparative studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H5421057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)<br/><br/>However, this recommendation may not apply to asymptomatic elderly (&gt;80 years) patients who have multiple comorbidities, where the procedural risks of cardioversion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> side effects of pharmacologic rhythm control may outweigh the benefits of restoring SR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Restoration of sinus rhythm'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term rhythm control</strong> &ndash; Patients who will be placed on long-term antiarrhythmic drugs or who will undergo catheter ablation will have SR restored as the initial part of that process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic persistent AF</strong> &ndash; It may be appropriate to attempt to restore SR in a patient with persistent or occasionally in patients with presumed permanent AF. An example of the latter is a patient with long duration AF who now has developed increasing heart failure or dilated cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>Frequently, the only way to determine if subtle, nonspecific symptoms are attributable to AF is to restore SR to see if symptoms improve. However, given mechanical recovery of atrial mechanical function is related to the duration of AF prior to cardioversion, it may take several weeks for full mechanical benefit of SR to manifest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infrequent symptomatic episodes </strong>&ndash; Patients with infrequent symptomatic episodes that do not spontaneously revert to SR may be candidates for cardioversion.

This can be achieved by oral (and occasionally intravenous) administration of beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the acute setting, the target resting ventricular rate should usually be 80 to 100 beats per minute. After ventricular rate control has been achieved, many patients will spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Spontaneous conversion is most likely to occur in patients with a duration of atrial fibrillation (AF) less than 48 hours, or in patients with a history of short, self-limited, episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The rate of spontaneous conversion has been reported to be around 50 percent at 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

For these patients who are not anticoagulated but are candidates, intravenous heparin or low molecular weight heparin should be started as soon as possible, possibly with a loading dose of heparin prior to cardioversion. The approach to dosing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation of less than 48 hours duration'</a>.)</p><p>Decisions regarding long-term anticoagulation can be made after the patient has been stabilized and are guided by CHA2DS2-VASc. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For stable patients, the timing of elective cardioversion is determined in large part by the anticoagulant strategy chosen. Patients with AF duration longer than 48 hours or of unknown duration should be anticoagulated for at least three weeks or receive short-term anticoagulation and screening transesophageal echocardiography prior to cardioversion. Due to atrial stunning associated with cardioversion, initiation of pre-cardioversion anticoagulation should also be considered for patients with an AF duration of less than 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528718202\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is useful to evaluate the patient for an underlying or precipitating cause, such as hyperthyroidism, prior to performing cardioversion.

Evidence from studies that compare antiarrhythmic drugs to placebo suggests significantly lower rates of successful conversion using a pharmacologic approach versus DC cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-uses-of-amiodarone#H17047227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical uses of amiodarone&quot;, section on 'Oral amiodarone for pharmacologic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use of dofetilide&quot;, section on 'Oral dofetilide for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter terminatinon and prevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide#H5117190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use of ibutilide&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a> and <a href=\"#H8701769\" class=\"local\">'Flecainide'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8701654\" class=\"local\">'DC cardioversion'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to a lower success rate, other disadvantages of pharmacologic cardioversion include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for prolonged telemetric monitoring (perhaps as long as 50 percent of the drug&rsquo;s elimination half-life) to screen for a proarrhythmic response. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AF may convert to atrial flutter. The class IA drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) may both slow the rate of the atrial flutter through their direct effects on sodium channels and enhance atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction through their vagolytic effect. The net result may be an increased AV conduction at ventricular rates that may exceed 220 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. Class IC drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>) do not have a vagolytic effect, but can slow the rate of atrial flutter sufficiently to permit rapid one-to-one AV conduction. In the hemodynamically stable patient, the ventricular rate should usually be controlled with an AV nodal blocking drug, as discussed above, before a class IA or IC drug is given. (See <a href=\"#H8701631\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular rate control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The main potential advantage to pharmacologic conversion is that it obviates the need for <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia</span> that is required with DC cardioversion. Other reasons to initiate pharmacologic therapy prior to cardioversion are discussed below.

The overall success rate falls as the AF duration increases. &#160;</p><p>With regard to the recommendations above, our experts rarely use pharmacologic therapy as the primary mechanism for AF cardioversion. As discussed above, antiarrhythmic drugs are used as pretreatment prior to DC cardioversion in some cases and to facilitate conversion of episodes of the AF that may be paroxysmal in any event.

The timing of AF recurrence was evaluated in a review of 61 patients who had daily electrocardiographic recordings using trans-telephonic monitoring: 57 percent had recurrent AF during the first month after cardioversion, with a peak incidence during the first five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This is one of the reasons that post-cardioversion anticoagulation is often used. </p><p>DC cardioversion may be repeated if AF recurs acutely in patients who have not been pretreated with antiarrhythmic therapy. In such patients or those in whom cardioversion fails, the combination of an atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocker plus intravenous loading with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> may restore SR pharmacologically. If the AF persists, DC cardioversion may be performed and if successful, the patient may be placed on long-term antiarrhythmic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8701755\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic cardioversion'</a> below.)</p><p>A separate issue is whether to perform repeat cardioversion for later recurrence. Less than 14 percent of patients remain in SR for a prolonged period after a third cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, an important consideration is the time interval between AF episodes. In both of the above reports, a third cardioversion for recurrent AF was performed within seven days of the second cardioversion. Repeated cardioversion may be a reasonable approach for patients with AF that recurs after a longer duration of SR (eg, years). It is most likely to be successful in younger patients with fair exercise tolerance and AF duration of less than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Repeat cardioversion or nonpharmacologic therapy (catheter ablation of AF or atrioventricular nodal ablation) may be necessary in patients who remain symptomatic when in recurrent AF. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528717161\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bradyarrhythmias are occasionally seen after DC cardioversion; ventricular tachyarrhythmias are rare. In a retrospective study of 6906 cardioversions of acute AF in 2868 patients, there were 63 (0.9 percent) episodes of bradyarrhythmia (51 episodes of asystole &gt;5 seconds and 12 episodes of bradycardia with heart rate &lt;40 bpm) in 54 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Nevertheless, the hemodynamic benefit from cardioversion may be sufficient to warrant restoration of SR with control of the atrial rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atrioventricular conduction with a pacemaker. Physiologic pacing in patients with sick sinus syndrome and SR appears to decrease the likelihood of recurrent AF, especially if the initiation of AF episodes is bradycardia-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In some of these patients, time will allow for a brief trial of rate slowing therapy. (See <a href=\"#H952132725\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For some stable patients with AF, the restoration of sinus rhythm with either DC or pharmacologic cardioversion is necessary or reasonable (see <a href=\"#H952132725\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above): &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most symptomatic patients with new onset or newly recognized AF, we suggest an attempt at cardioversion, as opposed to no attempt (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In elderly patients or those with multiple medical comorbidities, it is reasonable to avoid cardioversion if the symptoms can be minimized and pharmacologic ventricular rate control is achieved; the approach needs to be individualized. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For some patients in whom a long-term strategy with rate control has failed and a rhythm control strategy has been chosen, cardioversion may need to be performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with infrequent episodes of AF that do not spontaneously convert, including those being managed with a rhythm control strategy, are candidates for periodic DC cardioversion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients in whom cardioversion is chosen will need the ventricular rate controlled and the need for anticoagulation assessed prior to cardioversion. (See <a href=\"#H8701631\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular rate control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8701646\" class=\"local\">'Timing and anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with new onset AF who do not have factors that predict a very low likelihood of success of DC cardioversion, and in whom long-term maintenance antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not planned, we recommend DC instead of pharmacologic cardioversion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H166080599\" class=\"local\">'Reasons to not cardiovert'</a> above and <a href=\"#H413338\" class=\"local\">'DC versus pharmacologic cardioversion'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiarrhythmic drugs may be initiated prior to DC cardioversion to increase the likelihood of a successful electrical cardioversion, to increase the likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm in the hours after cardioversion, or as the first step in a plan for long-term antiarrhythmic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8701669\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with AF and no structural heart disease (including no evidence of coronary artery disease) for whom pharmacologic cardioversion is chosen, we recommend either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> rather than other antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The choice between these two drugs should be influenced by the practitioner&rsquo;s experience and the clinical situation. Some of our experts are comfortable using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H8701755\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic cardioversion'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decision to use antiarrhythmic drug therapy for cardioversion in patients with structural heart disease will likely occur in those for whom long-term antiarrhythmic therapy is being considered. In these patients, the choice of drug will be driven by the agent chosen for maintenance therapy. Drugs that can be used prior to DC cardioversion include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>.
