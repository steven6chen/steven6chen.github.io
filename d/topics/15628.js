In contrast to the X chromosome-linked gamma-c form of SCID, which affects only males, SCID due to defects of the <em>JAK3</em> gene results in T-B+NK- SCID that is transmitted via an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (MIM #600802) and affects males and females equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>SCID due to JAK3 deficiency is increasingly identified in otherwise healthy infants by newborn screening with the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>).

Natural killer (NK) cells are usually severely reduced in numbers.</p><p>SCID with JAK3 deficiency can be regarded as a failure of multiple cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, similar to SCIDX1. In particular, impaired IL-7 signaling appears to be responsible for the pronounced defect in T cell development, while impaired IL-15 signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] is most likely responsible for the characteristic lack of NK cells in patients with JAK3 deficiency. This was demonstrated in a patient with atypical JAK3 deficiency who had NK cells and functionally impaired CD4+ T cells that transduced IL-2, IL-4, IL-15, and IL-21 signals but failed to respond to IL-7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is also corroborated by findings in IL-7 and IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha) knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>] and in humans affected with T-B+NK+ SCID due to IL-7Ralpha mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

However, intrinsic functions of B cells, including ability to undergo activation, proliferation, differentiation, and isotype switching, are impaired, resulting in the profound hypogammaglobulinemia and specific antibody deficiency characteristic of JAK3 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/1,2,5,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,30</a>].</p><p>In vitro studies with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized lymphoblastoid B cell lines have shown impaired responses of JAK3-deficient B cells to IL-2 and IL-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

When not identified by population-based screening, JAK3 SCID typically presents at a few months of age with infectious complications that classically defined SCID in the prescreening era. These infants typically have recurrent or severe respiratory infections, intractable diarrhea, thrush, and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/1-3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5-7</a>]. Failure to recover from infections and coexisting infections with multiple pathogens are characteristic. Infections are frequently caused by opportunistic pathogens and become life threatening, a true pediatric medical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/3,7,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,39</a>].

Severe or fatal infection can be seen with other live-attenuated vaccines (oral polio, varicella, Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin) as well.

Thus, they may present with graft-versus-host disease due to transplacentally acquired maternal T cells (or, if unirradiated transfusions have been given, unrelated-donor allogeneic T cells). The infiltrating foreign cells cause rashes, abdominal organomegaly, and tissue damage. In rare cases of hypomorphic mutation of JAK3, in which residual protein function is preserved, the disease may present as Omenn syndrome, with erythroderma rash, adenopathy, eosinophilia, elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE), and oligoclonal expansion of autologous T cells with poor diversity.

It is hypothesized that &quot;leaky&quot; <em>JAK3</em> mutations compatible with the expression of low and variable levels of functional JAK3 protein are responsible for the differences in disease severity and the unique and almost paradoxical clinical features observed in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In one affected family, for example, compound heterozygote mutations in the <em>JAK3</em> gene resulted in a severe lymphoproliferative disorder in an 8-year-old child, but his 18-year-old sibling with identical defects was nearly asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The genetic defects of these siblings were associated with low amounts of functional protein. In addition, somatic chimerism with presence of JAK3 revertant T cells was reported in two affected siblings whose clinical and immunologic phenotype evolved from combined immunodeficiency to predominant CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Furthermore, somatic reversion of <em>JAK3</em> mutations in T cells may modulate the disease phenotype, as demonstrated by patients presenting with predominant CD4+ cell lymphopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Thus, partial JAK3 defects may be the basis for the immunologic problems in patients with increased, but not overwhelming, susceptibility to infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disorders of immune regulation who do not meet the typical phenotypic characteristics of SCID patients. Although most such patients are expected to have low numbers of TRECs and thus to be identified in the neonatal period by TREC screening, further experience with these rare individuals will be required to define the disease presentation in the newborn screening era.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphopenia is a common, although not universal, laboratory finding in patients with T-B+NK- SCID due to JAK3 deficiency since B cells may be elevated in number, masking the lack of T and natural killer (NK) cells. However, CD3 T cells and, in particular, numbers of <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3/CD4-</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3/CD8-positive</span> T cells that express the CD45RA na&iuml;ve marker are exceptionally low. Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subsets shows low to undetectable numbers of CD3 T cells and NK cells (&lt;50 NK <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and &lt;1 percent of total lymphocytes), while B cell numbers are normal or increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/5,7,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,39</a>]. Development of other types of innate lymphoid cells, with the possible exception on innate lymphoid cells type 1 (ILC1), is also compromised in patients with SCID due to <em>JAK3</em> or interleukin-2 receptor-gamma (<em>IL2RG</em>; common gamma [gamma-c] chain) mutations, although this deficiency may not contribute to increase susceptibility to infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) acquired transplacentally during the last seven weeks of pregnancy is usually present initially and declines postnatally, and antibody responses are not elicited following immunization. The severe reduction in the number of T and NK cells is associated with a lack of in vitro proliferation to mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and of NK in vitro cytotoxic activity, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/3,7,30,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,30,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4140793\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only tests specific for JAK3 deficiency will be discussed here.

In rare cases, deep intronic mutations that create novel cryptic splice sites may also cause the disease, indicating the need for careful analysis of noncoding regions in patients with a T-B+NK- SCID phenotype in which no <em>IL2RG</em> or <em>JAK3</em> exonic or canonical splice-site mutations have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In such cases, sequencing of the cDNA product may facilitate the diagnosis. Identification of the specific gene mutations in the patient and confirmation of asymptomatic <em>JAK3</em> mutation carrier status in the parents by sequencing allows for definitive diagnosis as well as genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for management of future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>JAK3 deficiency is compatible with the presence of significant numbers of circulating, although mostly poorly functioning, T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/39,42,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42,50</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;, section on 'Protective measures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While awaiting determination of the optimal donor for HCT, it is essential that patients are maintained free from infections that could compromise their health status and ultimately the outcome of transplantation. If possible, reverse isolation should be used to protect these patients from environmental pathogens. It is imperative to provide protective <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> infusions and prophylactic antimicrobials to minimize the chance of <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia, bacterial, viral, and other fungal pathogens.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A small series of 10 patients with JAK3 deficiency received HCT at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Transplantation was from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical family donor in two cases, from an unrelated cord blood in one case, and from a haploidentical parent in seven cases. Pre-HCT chemotherapy was used only in the patient who received cord blood transplantation. Nine of the 10 patients had attained robust T cell reconstitution and were reported to be alive and no longer prone to recurrent or opportunistic infections between 4 and 18 years after HCT. However, only three patients were able to discontinue treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and donor B cell engraftment was achieved only in the child who received pre-HCT conditioning. In addition, seven of the nine patients continued to have poor natural killer (NK) cell number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function.</p><p>All forms of T-B+ SCID (including JAK3 deficiency) have been grouped together in larger series of patients. In the European series, for example, 10-year survival after HCT was 70 percent for 345 patients with T- B+ SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Successful reconstitution of T cell numbers and function can be obtained after transplantation of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors obtained from HLA-identical siblings; matched, unrelated volunteer donors; and haploidentical parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/8,30,39,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30,39,53,54</a>]. The lack of NK cells (and NK cell function) in JAK3-deficient patients makes graft rejection improbable, thereby facilitating the success of HCT. In addition, the early block in thymic T cell development that is characteristic of JAK3 deficiency probably favors thymic repopulation by the donor's normal lymphoid precursors and their differentiation into mature T cells.</p><p>The situation is quite different with regards to the reconstitution of the humoral immune response. Differentiation proceeds up to mature B cells in patients with JAK3 deficiency. The presence of these B cells, although functionally deficient, and that of their progenitors creates competition between autologous- and donor-derived B lymphopoiesis following HCT. Thus, the reconstitution of humoral immunity following haploidentical HCT is often incomplete, leading to the need of long-term administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/3,30,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30,53</a>]. Development of effective B cell function is more common following HCT from HLA-identical sibling donors and has been observed even in some patients who maintained autologous B cells following HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/30,35,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35,53</a>]. Reconstitution of NK function also seems unpredictable in patients with JAK3 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An important complication of HCT in patients with SCID due to JAK3 deficiency is the appearance of warts due to papillomavirus infection even several years after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This long-term complication has been observed particularly in patients with SCID due to common gamma (gamma-c) defects or to JAK3 deficiency and less often in patients with SCID due to other genetic causes, suggesting that warts reflect an incomplete correction of defective gamma-c-mediated signaling defect in particular cell types, such as keratinocytes. However, the possible contribution of incomplete or vanishing immune reconstitution cannot be formally excluded.</p><p>Altogether, these results clearly indicate that HCT is a life-saving procedure for SCID due to JAK3 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in the absence of an HLA-identical family donor, the procedure is imperfect and leaves room for improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4141879\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is arguable that genetic correction of JAK3 deficiency may also result in clinical benefit in light of the success of gene therapy in a series of SCIDX1 patients and because of the phenotypic and biologic similarities between JAK3 deficiency and SCIDX1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. On the other hand, one potential concern of using a &quot;gene addition&quot; approach is that the expression of the transferred gene is evicted from the cellular mechanisms of regulation and is constitutively expressed under the control of strong viral promoters. JAK3 has an important role in cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31</a>], and deregulated JAK3 expression could potentially result in uncontrolled cell division causing malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Preclinical experiments in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>] have illustrated the potential of gene therapy for JAK3 deficiency. Retroviral-mediated <em>JAK3</em> gene transfer was able to correct the biologic abnormalities of JAK3-deficient human B cell lines leading to reconstitution of interleukin (IL)-2 signaling (as assessed by IL-2-induced phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta, JAK1, JAK3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 [STAT5]) and IL-2-mediated cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>A series of in vivo experiments were performed and showed that ex-vivo retroviral-mediated <em>JAK3</em> gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitors from JAK3 knockout mice was able to restore specific T and B cell functions in mice transplanted with gene-corrected cells. Treated mice developed T cells able to respond to mitogens and develop specific cytotoxic responses. In addition, good reconstitution of humoral immunity was achieved following the procedure, with increased numbers of B cells and antibody production. More importantly, the same mice showed generation of specific antibody responses upon immunization and improved survival after exposure to influenza virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>Another crucial finding of these experiments was that myeloablation was not necessary for the achievement of these significant improvements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The strong selective advantage of JAK3-corrected lymphoid cells over unmodified autologous counterparts is probably responsible for these results that suggest that preparative conditioning is needed in the case of <em>JAK3</em> gene therapy protocols in humans.</p><p>A single JAK3-deficient patient who had failed HCT was enrolled in a gene therapy trial. The results of that experience were only published in abstract form and showed no evidence of immune reconstitution at seven months posttreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This trial was placed on clinical hold, and no additional patients were enrolled because of the occurrence of leukemia in two children treated with gene therapy for X-linked SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. It is reasonable to assume that expression of JAK3 could have similar consequences. For these reasons, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee made the recommendation in 2003 that, until more information is acquired, gene therapy for SCIDX1 and JAK3-SCID should be performed only on patients for whom alternative therapies are not available or have already failed. More recent developments in gene therapy for SCID include the use of self-inactivating vectors or lentivirus vectors that are likely to be safer than the original constructs used for SCIDX1 gene therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Limitations of gene therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the ultimate goal of gene therapy (ie, the correction of the genetic defect within its genomic contest) is becoming a close reality thanks to the technologies of gene editing. Among these, a <span class=\"nowrap\">CRISPR/Cas9-based</span> approach has been used to achieve the homology-directed repair of a pathogenic C1837T nonsense mutation of the <em>JAK3</em> gene in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a JAK3-SCID patient. In vitro differentiation experiments showed that, contrary to the original, mutated cells, the corrected iPSCs were able to generate T and NK cells. This demonstrates that lymphoid differentiation capability was restored, opening the way to the future development of this technology for gene therapy of patients affected with JAK3-SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4141909\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients typically die within the first year or two of life unless the underlying defect is corrected (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>).
