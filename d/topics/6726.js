Although resection usually controls the primary lesion, melanoma often metastasizes through lymphatic channels to regional lymph nodes. Accurate staging at diagnosis is important to assess the prognosis and determine whether the patient would benefit from adjuvant therapy or is eligible for clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664%7EONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 graphicRef110663 \">table 1A-B</a>).

More definitive information about the status of the regional nodes can be obtained from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), elective lymph node dissection, or fine needle aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The staging of subclinical disease using lymphatic mapping followed by SLNB, the management of patients with a positive SLNB, and the management of clinically apparent regional lymph nodes will be reviewed here. The surgical management of the primary lesion and adjuvant therapy are discussed separately.

This approach provides important prognostic information and permits the identification of patients with a positive sentinel lymph node who may be candidates for adjuvant therapy. Proper application of this technique requires sufficient experience to identify the sentinel lymph nodes and ensure a low false negative rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphatic mapping is based upon the concept that sites of cutaneous melanoma have specific patterns of lymphatic spread and that one or more nodes are the first to be involved with metastatic disease within a given lymph node basin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52249 \">figure 1</a>). If the sentinel lymph nodes are not involved, the entire basin should be free of tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Knowledge of the regional lymph node status is important for several purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To determine prognosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To facilitate regional disease control in patients with regional lymph node involvement with possible improvement in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To select patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To select candidates for clinical trials</p><p/><p>Tc-99 can be used for both preoperative mapping and for sentinel node identification in the operating room using a hand-held gamma probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. The technique for SLNB is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-in-melanoma#H1958502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Lymph node evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Lymphatic mapping is particularly useful to identify the lymph node basins draining from primary sites located in areas of ambiguous and possibly multiple nodal basin drainage. These areas include the trunk, head and neck, and distal extremities. Dynamic lymphatic flow studies have shown that ambiguous and multidirectional flows are more common than previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>While a learning curve exists for the technical aspects of SLNB, the importance of a coordinated and consistent approach, including surgeon, nuclear medicine clinician, and pathologist cannot be overstated.</p><p>In contrast to the widespread acceptance of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy for extremity and truncal melanomas, the role of this technique for melanomas of the head and neck is evolving. The use of this approach has been limited by the complexity of lymphatic drainage patterns and the frequent need to remove sentinel nodes from the parotid gland, thereby risking damage to the facial nerve. That being said, sentinel nodes can be identified in 95 percent of cases with appropriate imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Skin of head and neck'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensitivity and specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the initial feasibility studies, SLNB was followed by completion lymph node dissection in all patients. The sentinel node was successfully identified in 75 to 90 percent of cases, and a negative SLNB with a positive nonsentinel node occurred in 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In subsequent studies, SLNB was followed by completion lymph node dissection only if the sentinel node contained tumor. In a review of the literature and meta-analysis involving a much larger recent experience, sentinel nodes were successfully identified in 97 to 98 percent of patients, with metastases in the sentinel node being detected at the frequency expected, based upon the incidence of regional disease observed in earlier studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The false-negative rate in a meta-analysis that included data on 25,000 patients in 71 studies was 12.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The false negative rate needs to be distinguished from the negative predictive value (the number of patients with a negative SLNB who do not recur divided by the total number of patients with a negative SLNB), which depends upon the patient population studied. </p><p>The test characteristics for SLNB are illustrated by results from the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In that trial, 59 patients had a late regional lymphatic recurrence and 486 had a positive SLNB, for an overall false negative rate of 11 percent, and a negative predictive value of 97 percent in that patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The landmark Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-I (MSLT-I) is the largest trial to address the role of lymphatic mapping with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in determining prognosis and its impact on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. The subsequent Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-II (MSLT-II) provides important information on the management of patients found to have a positive SLNB. (See <a href=\"#H1009098481\" class=\"local\">'Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II'</a> below.)</p><p>The final results of this trial confirmed the role of lymphatic mapping with SLNB as a prognostic tool. Furthermore, the trial demonstrated a significant melanoma-specific survival advantage in those patients with intermediate thickness melanoma with microscopic lymph node involvement who were assigned to lymphatic mapping with SLNB and underwent early regional lymphadenectomy, compared with those managed with wide excision of the primary melanoma followed by observation without lymphatic mapping and SLNB. The conclusions of the MSLT-I are also supported by the larger, retrospective series of 5840 patients in the Melanoma Institute Australia database treated between 1992 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>In the MSLT-I, 2001 patients were randomly assigned to lymphatic mapping with SLNB (60 percent) or to observation (40 percent) between 1994 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients randomly assigned to lymphatic mapping with SLNB underwent immediate completion lymphadenectomy if a histologically positive node was identified, while those with a negative SLNB were observed and underwent therapeutic lymphadenectomy if there was clinical evidence of subsequent nodal recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals assigned to observation had a therapeutic lymphadenectomy only if there was clinical evidence of nodal recurrence.</p><p/><p>The final report of the trial was published in 2014, and was based upon ten year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72832806\"><span class=\"h4\">Prognostic significance of the sentinel node</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of microscopic involvement of the sentinel lymph node at presentation was a significant predictor of subsequent relapse in patients with intermediate or thick primary melanomas.

The 10-year distant disease-free survival rate was also significantly improved in this subset of patients (54.8 versus 35.6 percent, HR 0.62 95% CI 0.42-0.91). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72832652\"><span class=\"h4\">Thick melanomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The study included 314 patients with thick melanomas (&gt;3.50 mm), of whom 311 were available for per protocol analysis. Lymph node metastases were identified in 32.9 percent of patients with thick melanomas at SLNB and an additional 12 patients who were initially sentinel lymph node biopsy negative subsequently were found to have nodal disease. Thus the estimated incidence of disease at 10 years was 42 percent.</p><p>Overall, there was no significant difference between the two treatment approaches in melanoma-specific survival for the entire group of patients with thick melanoma (10 year melanoma specific survival rate 58.9 versus 64.4 percent for the lymphatic mapping with SLNB versus initial observation, respectively, HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.76-1.67).</p><p>When the analysis was limited to those patients in whom lymph node disease was present, the 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was not significantly different in those who underwent SLNB compared with those initially managed with observation (48.0 versus 45.8 percent; HR for death 0.92, 95% CI 0.53-1.60). There also was no significant difference in the distant disease-free survival rate (45.3 versus 43.8 percent, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.56-1.64).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72832696\"><span class=\"h4\">Thin melanomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The study included 340 patients with thin melanomas (&lt;1.20 mm).

This was illustrated in 2120 patients enrolled on the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial, of whom 444 underwent completion lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At a median follow-up of 16 months, the overall complication rate was significantly lower for SLNB alone (5 versus 23 percent with SLNB plus completion lymphadenectomy).</p><p>The decrease in the rate of complications included wound infection (1 versus 7 percent with completion lymphadenectomy), lymphedema (0.7 versus 11.7 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">hematoma/seroma</span> (2 versus 6 percent) and sensory nerve injury (0.2 versus 1.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Differences in complication rates were particularly striking in patients who underwent groin procedures (total complications 8 versus 51 percent, and lymphedema 2 versus 32 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimal metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because fewer nodes are resected with SLNB compared with elective lymph node dissection, more careful pathologic evaluation is possible. Serial sectioning increases the likelihood of detecting melanoma metastases, although eight to ten sections may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Even though studies have shown that low volume involvement of the SLN is only rarely associated with tumor involvement of other lymph nodes, follow-up suggests that minimal metastasis in the SLN confers an increased risk of relapse and death relative to patients with no SLN involvement. </p><p>The impact of extent of SLN involvement is illustrated by a study of 1009 patients with a positive SLN who underwent completion lymph node dissection over a fifteen-year period at nine European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) melanoma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among the 113 patients with SLN tumor size &lt;0.1 mm, 10 (9 percent) were found to have tumor involvement of non-sentinel lymph nodes. The frequency of involvement of nonsentinel lymph nodes increased progressively with tumor size in the SLN (16 percent for those with 0.1 to 1.0 mm tumor and 25 percent for those with tumor &gt;1.0 mm). On multivariate analysis, lesser tumor involvement was significantly associated with improved melanoma-specific survival.</p><p>However, the data are inadequate to distinguish subsets of patients based upon the extent of tumor involvement in the sentinel lymph node, and completion lymph node dissection is indicated for patients with a positive SLNB regardless of the extent of tumor involvement. These issues are being addressed in the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II (NCT002978950). </p><p>However, a small number of SLNBs will be falsely reported as negative even with optimal technique. In the MSLT-I trial, for example, 3.4 percent of patients with a negative SLNB subsequently relapsed in the regional lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A similar rate of relapse was observed in a report from MD Anderson [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ten of 243 patients (4.1 percent) with histologically negative SLNB subsequently developed a nodal recurrence in the previously mapped basin. Reexamination of the original pathologic material using serial sections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunohistochemical staining identified melanoma in the sentinel nodes in eight of these ten patients.</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining for the melanoma markers S100, HMB45, or <span class=\"nowrap\">Melan-A/Mart-1</span> further enhances sensitivity, detecting 1 melanoma cell in 100,000 cells compared with 1 in 10,000 cells with routine hematoxylin and eosin stains (H&amp;E). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLNB is the standard approach for the management of patients with melanoma in whom there is a substantial risk of regional node metastasis. The likelihood of detecting metastatic deposits in a SLNB increases with the thickness of the primary lesion, providing a rationale for deciding which patients may benefit from this procedure. </p><p>The generally accepted approach focuses on tumor thickness and related risk factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLNB is indicated for melanomas &ge;1 mm thick. For lesions 1.01 to 2.0, 2.01 to 4.0, and &gt;4 mm, the risk of regional lymph node metastasis is approximately 12, 28, and 44 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumors &gt;4 mm thick have a risk of distant metastasis that can vary widely and is dependent on a variety of features including ulceration, primary location, patient age and gender. However, status of the SLNB may provide the most important prognostic information. For example, in one series of 571 patients with primary lesions &gt;4 mm thick, the median overall, disease-specific, and relapse-free survival were significantly longer in biopsy-proven node-negative patients compared with those with positive nodes (53 versus 35 months, 32 versus 14 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This information may be important to the patient and clinician and will very likely influence the choice of adjuvant therapy either as standard care or as part of a clinical trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For thin melanomas (ie, &lt;1 mm thick), the overall risk of regional node metastases in patients undergoing SLNB is estimated to be about 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. Various prognostic factors have been studied in an effort to identify subgroups in which the risk of nodal disease is high enough to justify SLNB. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective review from the Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group of 1250 patients with thin melanoma who underwent SLNB provides the most extensive data in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Breslow thickness &ge;0.75 mm, Clark level &ge;IV, and ulceration were associated with lymph node metastases in 6.3, 7.0, and 11.6 percent of cases, respectively, and these factors were all statistically significant on multivariate analysis. In contrast, melanomas &lt;0.75 mm thick had positive SLNBs less than 5 percent of the time regardless of the Clark level or the presence of ulceration. The low risk of a positive SLNB in patients with a primary lesion &lt;0.75 mm and without any other risk factors has also been seen in earlier studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of a positive SLNB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two randomized trials comparing immediate completion lymph node dissection with observation followed by lymph node dissection in the event of a regional lymph node recurrence have not demonstrated any improvement or a significant difference in melanoma-specific survival or distant metastasis-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p>Although completion dissection of all involved nodal basins previously was considered the standard treatment approach for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, the results of these two randomized trials support observation with careful follow-up that includes serial ultrasonography in this setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009098481\"><span class=\"h3\">Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phase III MSLT-II trial included 1934 evaluable patients who had a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy as well as a wide local excision of a primary melanoma that had a Breslow thickness &ge;1.20 mm or greater and Clark level III, a Clark level IV or V regardless of Breslow thickness, or a primary tumor with ulceration regardless of thickness or Clark level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to either completion lymph node dissection or observation, which importantly, included ultrasound evaluation of appropriate lymph node basins prior to lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy and at each follow-up visit.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with clinically negative regional lymph nodes, the decision whether or not to perform an SLNB is based upon the likelihood of regional lymph node involvement: (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a melanoma 0.75 mm thick or greater, we recommend performing an SLNB. This criterion includes patients with intermediate and thick primary lesions, as well as those with thin melanomas 0.75 to 1.00 mm thick. These patients should have nodal basin ultrasonography prior to lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a melanoma less than 0.75 mm thick and one or more factors placing the patient at increased risk for nodal involvement (ulceration of the primary tumor, a mitotic rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1/mm<sup>2</sup>,</span> or lymphovascular invasion), we favor performing an SLNB. However, the absolute risk of a positive sentinel lymph node is small in this group, and a detailed discussion with the patient is needed to discuss the potential risks and benefits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SLNB is not indicated for patients with a melanoma &lt;0.75 mm and no other factors placing the patient at increased risk for nodal involvement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a positive SLNB, we suggest careful clinical observation coupled with ultrasound surveillance of the positive nodal basin rather than immediate completion lymph node dissection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Completion lymph node dissection is indicated if there is subsequent evidence of regional lymph node recurrence in the absence of distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of a positive SLNB'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with microscopic involvement of a single lymph node (N1a disease), we suggest adjuvant immunotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If there is macroscopic involvement of a lymph node or if there is involvement of more than one node (N1b, N2, or N3 disease), we recommend adjuvant immunotherapy with nivolumab (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with clinically apparent regional lymph node involvement that is confirmed cytologically (fine needle aspirate) or histologically, we recommend therapeutic regional lymphadenectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Partial dissection or lymph node sampling is not considered an acceptable alternative because of the propensity of melanoma to spread microscopically to other nodes in the basin.
