This systemic vasodilation reduces left ventricular systolic wall stress.</p><p>In patients with exertional stable angina, nitrates improve exercise tolerance, time to onset of angina, and ST-segment depression during exercise testing. In combination with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, nitrates produce greater antianginal and antiischemic effects.</p><p>Its use, however, is complicated by the development of tolerance with continuous therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nitrate tolerance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitrates dilate veins, arteries, and coronary arteries by relaxing vascular smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They produce these effects by entering vascular smooth muscle cells where they are metabolized to 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate and nitrite, via mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2 or mtALDH), and then nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiols (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50622 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sulfhydryl groups on ALDH2 are required for activity, which can explain the known sulfhydryl requirement for vascular smooth muscle relaxation by nitrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most of the antiischemic efficacy of nitrates pertains to their ability to decrease myocardial oxygen demand as a result of systemic vasodilatation rather than any activity as a coronary vasodilator. Nitrates do not have a direct effect on cardiac chronotropy or inotropy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on systemic hemodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nitrates are primarily venodilators due to increased bioavailability to venous smooth muscle cells. Venodilation lowers preload (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) and therefore reduces wall stress, resulting in a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. The fall in preload is more pronounced with sitting or standing.</p><p>At low doses, nitrates cause a lesser degree of arterial and arteriolar dilatation, leading to little or no change in systemic vascular resistance or blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As the dose is increased, the blood pressure falls, often accompanied by reflex tachycardia. Wall stress is reduced at the lower blood pressure, resulting in a further decrease in myocardial oxygen demand.</p><p>Some patients, especially those with hypovolemia, are extremely sensitive to the arteriolar effect of nitrates and develop a profound drop in blood pressure which can aggravate myocardial ischemia. In addition, arteriolar dilatation of the face can cause flushing and meningeal arterial dilatation can cause headache, two common side effects of these drugs.</p><p>Problems can also occur with excessive venodilation. This can result in a marked decrease in venous return, which induces cardiac emptying that triggers mechanical receptors in the heart, possibly leading to hypotension and bradycardia consistent with the Bezold-Jarisch reflex (vasovagal response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on coronary hemodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nitrate-induced increase in coronary blood flow has been proposed as a potential mechanism for relieving ischemia. Animal and human studies have shown that nitrates dilate both normal and abnormal coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; this response is preserved in saphenous vein grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The clinical importance of this effect is uncertain because the coronary arterioles in patients with a flow-limiting coronary stenosis are already dilated to maintain resting blood flow, making further coronary dilation during ischemia difficult.</p><p>There are, however, settings in which a direct effect on coronary hemodynamics may be beneficial. Nitrates can reduce or reverse coronary vasospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, patients with primarily vasospastic angina or a large vasoconstrictor component to their angina can benefit from the direct coronary action of nitrate therapy. Nitrates also indirectly improve subendocardial blood flow as the reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure induced by systemic venous dilatation decreases the resistance to coronary blood flow from epicardium to endocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, nitrates may lower the resistance to collateral vessel blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiplatelet and antithrombotic properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitrates have significant antiplatelet and antithrombotic properties; however the clinical importance of these potentially beneficial effects is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Stimulation of platelet guanylate cyclase by nitrates prevents fibrinogen binding to platelet <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptors, which is essential for platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in patients with angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3981012660\"><span class=\"h1\">USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitrates, usually in the form of a sublingual preparation, are the first-line therapy for the treatment of <strong>acute</strong> anginal symptoms. Patients should be instructed to use them at the onset of angina. </p><p>A sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> tablet may be recommended for the prophylaxis of anginal episodes and we often recommend them in patients with predictable and stable angina. For example, patients who have undergone incomplete revascularization who get angina at a predictable workload may be good candidates for prophylactic nitroglycerin. Some patients may benefit from a repeat dose if angina occurs during the activity.</p><p>Long-acting nitrates are added to beta blockers (with or without calcium channel blockers) to control stable angina. In patients with exertional stable angina, chronic nitrate therapy using oral or dermal preparations improves exercise tolerance, time to onset of angina, and ST-segment depression during exercise testing. In combination with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, nitrates produce greater antianginal and antiischemic effects compared with those drugs without nitrates. However, the long-term utility of nitrates is limited by the induction of nitrate tolerance.</p><p>There is no difference in efficacy among the various oral or dermal nitrate preparations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NITRATE TOLERANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tolerance has been a major problem with the use of nitrates as chronic antianginal therapy. It was first observed in individuals exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> during the production of explosives. These workers developed severe headache and dizziness after the initial exposure. These side effects would then diminish after several days. If, however, exposure was avoided for several days, the symptoms would return after reexposure.</p><p>A similar sequence occurs in humans as chronic nitrate therapy for angina pectoris is associated with attenuation and at times abolition of the hemodynamic and antianginal effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of tolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How nitrate tolerance occurs is incompletely understood. It is due to attenuation of the vascular effect of nitrates, not to altered pharmacokinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>At least three, not mutually exclusive, mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of nitrate tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> bioconversion to 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate with decreased formation of nitric oxide. This effect is nitrate-specific and is not seen with non-nitrate sources of nitric oxide such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Consistent with this theory are the experimental observations that there is no tolerance to the effect of S-nitrosothiols and that the activity of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (mtALDH), the enzyme required for metabolism of nitrates to 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate in markedly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The same findings can be induced by inhibitors of mtALDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced bioactivity of nitric oxide&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Consistent with this theory is the finding in an animal study that vascular and hemodynamic tolerance to nitrates occurred despite high levels of nitric oxide and rates of nitric oxide formation that were similar in those animals that were not tolerant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Also in support of this hypothesis is that transgenic animals that overexpress endothelial nitric oxide synthase have chronically elevated nitric oxide release, which is associated with reduced vascular reactivity to nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the vasoconstrictor renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems in response to nitrate-induced vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. There is also increased peripheral sensitivity to these vasoconstrictors, an effect that can be reversed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Abnormal coronary vasoconstrictor responses have also been described with continuous nitrate exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several strategies have been attempted to prevent nitrate tolerance, the most effective being intermittent therapy with an adequate nitrate-free interval (around 8 to 10 hours). It is thought that a nitrate-free interval permits the regeneration of reduced sulfhydryl groups, thereby restoring vascular responsiveness to nitrates. Chronic therapy with N-acetylcysteine, a sulfhydryl donor, does not appear to be effective in patients with stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], in contrast to its acute benefit with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> in those with unstable angina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrates-in-the-management-of-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nitrates in the management of acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are, however, two concerns regarding intermittent therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A time-zero effect, which refers to a deterioration in exercise performance relative to placebo prior to the morning dose of nitrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rebound angina, which refers to an increase in angina during the nitrate-free interval. There may result from a supersensitivity of the vessel wall to vasoconstrictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] or an increased vasomotor response to acetylcholine, suggesting the development of endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>Whether these effects occur to a clinically significant degree remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Their importance with the different nitrate preparations will be discussed below.</p><p>Several other methods have been proposed to reduce nitrate tolerance, although <strong>none</strong> is as yet used clinically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Folic acid</a> can reverse endothelial dysfunction, possibly by restoring the bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for nitric oxide synthase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arginine, its substrate. This suggests a possible role for folic acid in preventing nitrate tolerance. This was examined in a study of 18 subjects who were randomly assigned to folic acid (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo for one week; all patients received continuous transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Low bioavailability from hepatic metabolism has necessitated relatively large doses of 10 to 40 mg three times daily.</p><p>The beneficial effects of a single dose of ISDN (15, 30, 60, 120 mg) were demonstrated in 12 patients with chronic stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There was a dose-related reduction in systolic blood pressure that persisted for eight hours. Exercise duration improved up to eight hours after the 15 and 30 mg dose; there was no added benefit with the 60 and 120 mg doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61032 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Unfortunately, tolerance has limited the usefulness of ISDN as a chronic antianginal agent. In the study above, ISDN was given four times daily for two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]: both the blood pressure and exercise responses were attenuated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61032 \">figure 2</a>). In particular, exercise duration was only increased for two hours after a dose and doses above 15 mg four times daily produced no added benefit. The development of tolerance occurred despite higher plasma concentrations of ISDN during maintenance therapy.</p><p>Several studies have altered the drug regimen in an attempt to prevent the development of tolerance. One study, for example, examined the effect of 30 mg of ISDN given two (7 AM and 12 PM), three (7 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM), and four (7 AM, 12 PM, 5 PM, and 11 PM) times daily for one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Exercise duration until the onset of angina was assessed before and one, three, and five hours after the morning dose. After a single initial dose, exercise duration significantly increased versus placebo over the five hour observation period. After one week of therapy, two and three (but not four) times daily dosing was associated with improved exercise tolerance compared placebo; however, the benefit was less pronounced late in the day, indicating partial tolerance. One limitation to the clinical utility of these results is that the response was measured only to the morning dose of ISDN.</p><p>Another report questioned the antianginal efficacy of three times daily ISDN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Eight patients with chronic stable angina were given ISDN at 8 AM, 1 PM, and 6 PM.

These patches have either a polymer matrix or a silicone gel impregnated with nitroglycerin; a semipermeable membrane between the drug reservoir and the skin results in a constant delivery of nitroglycerin.

In one report, for example, patches of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 mg were given continuously and treadmill walking time was examined after two, four, and 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. With the exception of the 45 mg dose, antianginal effects were seen at two and four hours but absent at 24 hours on the first day. Daily therapy with 15 mg patches for one to two weeks was associated with antianginal and hemodynamic effects that were not different from placebo patches. Similar findings were noted in a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial involving 562 patients examined the efficacy of eight weeks of continuous transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

After 30 days of therapy, treadmill walking time until the onset of angina or 1 mm ST depression was significantly improved in all treatment groups when compared to placebo.

However, another study, directly evaluated the effect of intermittent transdermal nitroglycerin on the occurrence of ischemia during patch-off hours in 72 patients who were randomized to 12 hours of transdermal nitroglycerin or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. After two weeks of therapy, patients crossed over to the alternative treatment. Compared to placebo, transdermal nitroglycerin significantly reduced the magnitude of ST segment depression at angina onset during exercise testing, but did not alter total angina frequency.
