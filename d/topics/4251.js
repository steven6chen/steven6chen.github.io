Coccidioidomycosis has protean manifestations and is frequently unrecognized, especially in travelers to endemic areas who return to locations where the disease is not typically encountered. Without specific laboratory tests, it is generally not possible to differentiate coccidioidal infections from numerous other illnesses. This is especially true for the initial respiratory illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Several routine tests are commonly abnormal, especially with early coccidioidal pneumonia, but all are nonspecific. These include a slight increase in the peripheral white blood cell count, peripheral eosinophilia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Notably, serum procalcitonin levels are often normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly, chest radiographs or other imaging procedures may also reveal abnormalities. Although occasionally suggestive of the precise diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], confirmatory tests are nearly always needed.</p><p>Conventional approaches to diagnosing coccidioidomycosis involve identification or recovery of <em>Coccidioides</em> spp from clinical specimens and detection of specific anticoccidioidal antibodies in serum or other body fluids. The laboratory diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of coccidioidomycosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis in compromised hosts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1033148802\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSING PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H809390652\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of different tests can be used to diagnose coccidioidal infection. Which test to use depends in part upon the patient's signs and symptoms. Specific considerations for immunocompromised hosts and those with complications are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis in compromised hosts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most ambulatory patients who are suspected of having coccidioidomycosis are evaluated with serologic testing. There are several serologic tests available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests using enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for IgM and IgG should be ordered first, if possible. These tests are probably the most sensitive screening tests. Immunodiffusion tests are less sensitive but more specific. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the EIA is positive, a confirmatory immunodiffusion test should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the immunodiffusion test is reported as qualitatively positive for IgG antibodies, additional testing by the conventional complement fixation (CF) test or a quantitative immunodiffusion test for IgG antibodies should be carried out. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Detection of anticoccidioidal antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Antibodies can take weeks to months to develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, for patients with early infection, isolating the fungus in culture may be the only way to establish the diagnosis. Cultures are more often obtained in patients requiring hospitalization. Many clinicians do not consider this option in the outpatient setting since cultures can be difficult to obtain and patients do not typically have a productive cough. If cultures are obtained, the clinician caring for the patient should alert the microbiology laboratory since appropriate biocontainment procedures are needed to prevent infection in laboratory staff. (See <a href=\"#H4081002621\" class=\"local\">'Recovery of Coccidioides spp from clinical specimens'</a> below.)</p><p>A proprietary coccidioidal antigen assay is available that can be positive in urine and blood of patients with extensive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with coccidioidal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While useful as a biomarker to evaluate response to treatment in complex, extensive, or meningeal infections, it is not very useful for initial diagnosis in immunocompetent hosts. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antigen detection'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H96096634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Patient monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3056877740\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Detection of anticoccidioidal antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients exposed to <em>Coccidioides</em> spp develop symptoms of their acute illness 7 to 21 days later. Concurrently, antibodies develop against specific coccidioidal antigens in many, if not most, patients. When detected, anticoccidioidal antibodies are quite specific. However, the ability to detect these antibodies may lag behind the onset of illness by several weeks or even months, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. For this reason, the absence of detectable anticoccidioidal antibodies does not exclude the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis, especially early in the course of the clinical illness.</p><p>When antibodies are present, the concentrations decrease to undetectable levels during the course of illness for most patients who resolve their infection. Thus, patients who demonstrate measurable anticoccidioidal antibodies are likely to have a recent illness or one that continues to be active.</p><p>Commercial EIA kits measure IgM and IgG antibodies, and immunodiffusion kits measure tube precipitin-type antibodies (reported as &quot;IgM antibodies&quot;) and complement fixing-type antibodies (reported as &quot;IgG antibodies). These are the most common types of serologic tests ordered. Quantitative complement fixation (CF) or immunodiffusion tests are not supplied as kits and are generally only performed by reference laboratories. Within these general principles, the interpretation of the specific serologic tests varies as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220805493\"><span class=\"h4\">Enzyme-linked immunoassays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An EIA for coccidioidal antibodies is available commercially. Since specific antibodies are detected by reagents for different immunoglobulin classes, results from these tests are specific for IgM or IgG antibodies.</p><p>EIA can be used as a screening test with immunodiffusion tests conducted only if the EIA is positive. This is consistent with guideline recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Alternatively, EIA can be ordered if the immunodiffusion tests are negative and the clinical suspicion for coccidioidal infection remains high. (See <a href=\"#H809390652\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunodiffusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Positive EIA results are highly sensitive for coccidioidal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one study of 160 serum and 66 CSF specimens tested by CF, tube precipitin, and EIA, the EIA had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100, 98, 96, and 100 percent, respectively, compared with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When EIA and immunodiffusion test results were compared using panels of sera from patients with early coccidioidal infections, there were significantly more specimens positive by EIA than by immunodiffusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p>Although EIA for IgM and IgG are more sensitive than immunodiffusion tests, they may be less specific. Since there is frequently no independent confirmation of infection by culture in such patients, uncertainty surrounds the question of how to interpret positive EIA tests that are not confirmed by immunodiffusion. They are likely truly positive for patients when subsequent sera become immunodiffusion positive, but this only becomes clear with hindsight and may not occur for all patients. IgM EIA has been particularly prone to false-positive in the experience of some, but not all, laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Given these various considerations, a positive EIA might be viewed as supportive of a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis when the clinical manifestations are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this may provide insufficient confidence in severely ill patients, in which case further evaluation, such as invasive procedures for fungal cultures or histology, may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H4081002621\" class=\"local\">'Recovery of Coccidioides spp from clinical specimens'</a> below.)</p><p>A study conducted by the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated the specificity of EIA tests by measuring EIA reactivity of blood bank specimens from Puerto Rico (where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic) and from northwest Phoenix, Arizona using two commercially available kits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Sera from Puerto Rico showed EIA IgM-positive results in 2 to 3 percent and EIA IgG-positive results in 0.4 to 0.8 percent. Presumably this is the level of false-positive tests. EIA IgM results from the Phoenix blood bank sera were similar, but IgG results were higher (3 to 4 percent). Additional immunodiffusion studies using concentrated sera suggested that the positive IgG sera from Arizona, but not Puerto Rico, were also immunodiffusion positive. As useful as these estimates are, there remains a concern about the higher likelihood of false-positive EIA IgM rates due to insufficiently stringent washing to remove nonspecific antibodies that may be performed in some laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Immunodiffusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunodiffusion tests, when they are positive, are the most specific assays. If the immunodiffusion test is qualitatively positive, additional testing by the conventional CF test or a quantitative immunodiffusion test should be carried out. If either of these tests is positive, no additional testing is needed.</p><p>Immunodiffusion kits for both IgM and IgG antibodies are in common use. The immunodiffusion test for IgM antibodies is normally done on undiluted sera; however, its sensitivity can be increased by concentrating the sera from two- to eightfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. The clinician may need to contact the reporting laboratory for further clarification if test results are reported simply as a positive or negative immunodiffusion result, which occurs frequently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Complement fixing antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the original methods for detecting coccidioidal antibodies is a CF assay. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CF-type antibodies can be detected in body fluids other than serum, and their detection in the CSF is an especially important aid to the diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CF test also provides a quantitative measure of antibody concentrations, and serial determinations of CF-type antibodies have prognostic as well as diagnostic value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H96096634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Patient monitoring'</a>.) </p><p/><p>This test is based upon the depletion of complement that results after antibodies in a specimen from an infected patient form an immune complex when mixed with a coccidioidal antigen. The complement depletion is assessed by the failure of tanned red blood cells to lyse when added to the mixture; these cells are normally lysed in the presence of complement. This CF assay is often referred to as the &quot;IgG test&quot; since IgG is the immunoglobulin class usually involved in such immune complexes. Although the coccidioidal antigen used in this procedure is a complex extract of <em>C. immitis</em>, it is now known that the antigen involved in this reaction is a chitinase, a protein enzyme important for the structure of the fungal cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Anti-chitinase antibodies responsible for the CF reaction are also responsible for the immunodiffusion IgG reaction referred to above.</p><p>Antibody concentration is determined by assaying twofold serial dilutions of patient specimens for complement consumption. As a general rule, the greater the dilution that still results in complement consumption, the more likely the patient has extensive infection. Because the exact end-point result in relation to actual antibody concentration is difficult to standardize among laboratories, relative changes in results from the same laboratory may be more helpful in gauging whether a patient's infection is worsening (increasing titers) or improving (decreasing titers).</p><p>Although the original assay for CF-type antibodies continues to be used routinely by some reference laboratories, a commercial immunodiffusion kit can mimic the qualitative result of this reference procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunodiffusion'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H969026556\"><span class=\"h4\">Tube precipitin-type antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another one of the original methods for detecting anticoccidioidal antibodies is to demonstrate the formation of an antigen-antibody precipitin when an extract of <em>C. immitis</em> is mixed with serum from an infected patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These antibodies are directed against carbohydrate antigens of the fungal cell wall and develop relatively early during infection. </p><p>The tube precipitin assay is considered to be an &quot;IgM test&quot; because IgM antibodies are large and most capable of generating a precipitin reaction, and because these reactions are detected early after the onset of infection. Up to 90 percent of patients will have tube precipitin-type antibodies detected at sometime within the first three weeks of symptoms. For patients with a self-limited illness, less than 5 percent of patients will still have these antibodies detected seven months later.</p><p>Tube precipitin-type antibody testing has been largely supplanted by the commercial immunodiffusion kit that measures the same antigen and accurately parallels the results of the original assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunodiffusion'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Latex tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A latex test for coccidioidal antibodies is also available from commercial sources. Latex tests are attractive because of their ease of use and rapidity of obtaining a result. However, for detecting anticoccidioidal antibodies, the latex tests have appeared to have a significant number of false-positive reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For this reason, a positive latex test is not as reliable as any of the other tests described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4081002621\"><span class=\"h3\">Recovery of Coccidioides spp from clinical specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since <em>Coccidioides</em> spp are never normal flora, identifying this fungus in respiratory secretions, tissue, or other patient specimens is definitive evidence of a coccidioidal infection. This can be accomplished by either identifying the organism on direct examination or by growing it from fungal cultures. <em>Coccidioides </em>spp will also grow on routine bacterial media, but the plates must be held longer (usually one week) than is routinely done to isolate bacteria.</p><p>Despite the specificity of detecting <em>Coccidioides</em> spp from clinical specimens, cultures are not routinely obtained in the majority of coccidioidal infections. Obtaining fungal cultures in many office settings may be logistically difficult, and specimens that yield <em>Coccidioides</em> spp in culture pose a certain degree of risk to laboratory personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, positive cultures may be the earliest and, in some instances, the only means of diagnosis. As a general rule, trying to isolate <em>Coccidioides</em> spp becomes increasingly important for patients with more debilitating or widespread infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis in compromised hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If cultures are obtained, biocontainment procedures are needed to prevent infection in laboratory staff. In the past, <em>Coccidioides</em> spp were also listed by the <a href=\"http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/12314/cdc_12314_DS1.pdf&amp;token=uDdgD1RQFjFoaMN2Utm98BdKkBrgntUqyjkd2o7AZLq5CEmZokSCTjGuO81Yalw3UWuAeYoosdLD9E7hxX2Yrg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2420\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) as select agents of bioterrorism, and clinical laboratories that handled these fungi had to follow extensive and documented security practices. In 2012, <em>Coccidioides</em> spp were removed from the select agent list, and so these specific regulatory practices are no longer necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3176989156\"><span class=\"h4\">Staining characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common morphologic form of <em>Coccidioides</em> spp seen in clinical specimens during infection is spherules. These are often sufficiently large enough (20 to 70 microns) to be seen with magnification of 100- to 400-fold. However, Gram stain of respiratory tract specimens will miss these structures, since spherules do not take up the stain. The simplest method to detect spherules is to make a &quot;wet preparation&quot; using saline or potassium hydroxide solution. Calcofluor staining may also improve direct detection of spherules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Bronchoalveolar washings are often analyzed with Papanicolaou staining, which also reacts with spherules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>For tissue, hematoxylin and eosin staining will usually be sufficient to detect spherules, although occasionally special stains such as periodic acid Schiff or Grocott- or Gomori-methenamine silver will be needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75250%7EID%2F55301%7EID%2F68068\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75250 graphicRef55301 graphicRef68068 \">picture 1A-C</a>). However, spherules generally number fewer than 1 per 10 high-power fields in most specimens; thus, an extensive examination of such preparations will improve detection. Occasionally, mycelial elements are present in coccidioidal lesions, but these cannot be distinguished from other fungal species on morphologic characteristics. In one report, hyphal forms were demonstrated in the CSF or brain tissue from five patients with plastic devices present in the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mycelia were also evident in pulmonary cavities and in association with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Techniques are now available to identify <em>Coccidioides</em> in fixed tissue by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229651830\"><span class=\"h4\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When coccidioidomycosis is suspected clinically, the clinician caring for the patient should alert the microbiology laboratory since exposure in the laboratory setting can lead to infection in laboratory staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p><em>Coccidioides</em> spp are capable of growing on nearly any laboratory media, and therefore even routine cultures for bacterial isolation can be used. Growth usually is evident within the first week, although prior receipt of antifungal agents can delay isolation. Most strains of <em>Coccidioides</em> spp are nonpigmented. However, this is not always the case, and laboratory personnel should handle any culture in which hyphal growth becomes evident with appropriate biocontainment procedures.</p><p>In order to determine if an isolated fungus is within the <em>Coccidioides</em> genus, additional testing is necessary. In the past, the most common approach was to prepare a formalin extract of the fungus and determine if it contained a &quot;<em>Coccidioides</em>-specific&quot; antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/21,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,35</a>]. Although extremely reliable, this approach takes two or more weeks to complete. A more rapid procedure is now available as a commercial kit (Genprobe, San Diego, CA), which detects a <em>C. immitis</em>-specific DNA sequence. This has also been highly reliable and takes less than one day to complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>There are no commercially available tests to distinguish between <em>C. immitis</em> and <em>C. posadasii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, some reference laboratories offer molecular speciation; in addition, <em>C. posadasii</em> grows more readily at elevated temperatures than <em>C. immitis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Antigen detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coccidioidal antigen can be detected in urine or serum. However, the antigen test is generally not useful for diagnosing coccidioidomycosis because it is insensitive. Thus, we typically use this test to diagnose infection in those who are severely immunocompromised (eg, patients with AIDS) when serologic testing is negative, and in those with extensive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The antigen can also be a surrogate marker of fungal burden when disease is extensive, and therefore, used to monitor response to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H96096634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Patient monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>The antigen test was developed because it was noted that some patients with severe coccidioidomycosis exhibited false-positive results with the <em>Histoplasma</em> urinary antigen assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In response to this observation, an assay that detected coccidioidal antigen in the urine was developed and was found to have a sensitivity of 71 percent among patients with severe coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, an emerging trend in endemic areas is to screen asymptomatic patients without a known history of coccidiomycosis using the mercury-free <em>Coccidioides immitis</em> spherule-derived skin test (Spherusol, Nielsen Biosciences). Although the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved indication for Spherusol is to test for cell-mediated (delayed type) immune response in patients who have already been diagnosed with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>], a positive reaction to this skin test can be considered evidence of past coccidioidal infection, and therefore immunity to subsequent infection. This is based upon the extensive published evidence with spherulin and other coccidioidal skin testing preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p>Most patients who become infected with <em>Coccidioides</em> spp develop persistent or life-long dermal hypersensitivity to coccidioidal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, the information obtained from skin testing as part of routine primary care could be used to guide future management decisions. As an example, patients who are known to exhibit dermal hypersensitivity while healthy can be presumed to be immune to reinfection and subsequent illnesses are unlikely to be due to a new coccidioidal infection. Conversely, in those who are skin test negative, coccidioidomycosis should be considered in future illnesses. Skin testing can also be used for epidemiologic purposes. In a study that was performed in northern Mexico to assess the prevalence of exposure to <em>Coccidioides</em> and risk factors for infection, 1653 skin tests were placed, and 40 percent were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> use the <em>Coccidioides immitis</em> spherule-derived skin test antigen to diagnose current illness since dermal hypersensitivity often remains present for life and a reactive skin test may therefore reflect past infection unrelated to the current illness. Another problem is that occasional patients with more extensive complications of coccidioidomycosis may be anergic, which is generally a poor prognostic sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In these cases, a negative skin test could conceivably delay the correct diagnosis. However, in otherwise immunocompetent patients, if both a coccidioidal skin test and serology are negative, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is very unlikely. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Detection of anticoccidioidal antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822596142\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunocompromised hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing can be used to guide the use of preemptive therapy in asymptomatic immunocompromised patients who live in or are from endemic areas. Indications for testing and the use of antifungal agents for individuals with serologic evidence of infection are discussed elsewhere.

Specific tests must be performed to make a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis, since the clinical manifestations cannot be distinguished from a variety of other infections on clinical grounds alone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are suspected of having coccidioidomycosis should be evaluated with serologic testing. However, antibodies can take weeks to months to develop. Thus, for patients with early infection, isolating the fungus in culture may be the only way to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H809390652\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing using enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for IgM and IgG are more sensitive than immunodiffusion tests. Thus, they are typically used as the initial screening test with immunodiffusion tests conducted only if the EIA is positive. (See <a href=\"#H220805493\" class=\"local\">'Enzyme-linked immunoassays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunodiffusion tests, when they are positive, are the most specific serologic assays. If the immunodiffusion test is qualitatively positive, additional testing by the conventional complement fixation (CF) test or a quantitative immunodiffusion test should be carried out. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunodiffusion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Complement fixing antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since <em>Coccidioides</em> spp are never normal flora, identifying this fungus in respiratory secretions, tissue, or other patient specimens is definitive evidence of a coccidioidal infection. This can be accomplished by either identifying the organism by direct examination or by growing it in culture. If cultures are obtained, the clinician caring for the patient should alert the microbiology laboratory since appropriate biocontainment procedures are needed to prevent infection in laboratory staff. (See <a href=\"#H4081002621\" class=\"local\">'Recovery of Coccidioides spp from clinical specimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coccidioidal antigen can be detected in urine or serum. Although the antigen test is generally not useful for diagnosing coccidioidomycosis because it is insensitive, we use it to help diagnose infection in severely immunocompromised hosts (eg, patients with AIDS) whose serologic testing is negative, and in those with extensive disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antigen detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2116088333\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge John Galgiani, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kim MM, Blair JE, Carey EJ, et al.
