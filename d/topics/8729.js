A principal feature of such care is the implementation of preventive measures, including immunizations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The nephrologist as primary care clinician in patients with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with ESRD have a reduced response to vaccination because of the general suppression of the immune system associated with uremia. Compared with vaccination in patients without ESRD, for example, dialysis patients have a lower antibody titer and an inability to maintain adequate antibody titers over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The relatively low antibody response to a vaccine also appears to correlate with the degree of renal failure but not with the specific mode of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It appears that disturbances in T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells may be responsible for the altered acquired immunity in ESRD patients, but additional studies are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Little information exists concerning the effects of dialysis adequacy on the antibody response to vaccination. There is, however, indirect evidence that increasing dialysis may be associated with an enhanced response. In a study of 32 nutritionally replete peritoneal dialysis patients immunized with the hepatitis B vaccine, the initial weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> was 2.37 and 2.01 in converters and nonconverters, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Despite the evidence of decreased efficacy, recommendations are to vaccinate patients with ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. Immunization recommendations in the United States are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are presented in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 2</a>). A review of vaccination strategies in patients with ESRD is presented here. The discussion will center upon the vaccines of most importance for the dialysis population. These include hepatitis B virus (HBV), tetanus, pneumococcal, influenza, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B VIRUS VACCINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy exists concerning the overall effectiveness, including the <span class=\"nowrap\">cost/benefit</span> ratio, of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in patients with ESRD. The primary arguments against routine HBV vaccination in this patient population are based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced efficacy of the vaccine &ndash; Compared with a response rate of &gt;90 percent in patients without renal failure, only 50 to 60 percent of those with ESRD develop antibodies following HBV vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis have a higher antibody response, suggesting that the immune response correlates with the degree of renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The low rate of hepatitis B infection &ndash; The incidence of hepatitis B infection is only approximately 0.12 percent among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Despite these data, we and many clinicians recommend that chronic dialysis patients receive vaccination against hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>]. Support for this recommendation is provided by a case-control study that found that hemodialysis patients vaccinated against hepatitis B had a 70 percent lower risk for infection compared with nonvaccinated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Cases of HBV infection in hemodialysis units have also prompted the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to reiterate its recommendation that all dialysis patients receive hepatitis B vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The CDC suggested that the cost of vaccinating patients is mitigated by the reduced need for monthly surveillance of antigen and antibody status in those who develop specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The number of dialysis patients who have received hepatitis B vaccination has increased significantly over the last several decades. As an example, the percentage of dialysis patients who had received at least three doses of hepatitis B vaccine had increased from 5.4 percent in 1983 to 56 percent in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A review of ESRD Medicare beneficiaries found that, among incident hemodialysis patients, there was a 77 percent likelihood of receiving the hepatitis vaccine within three years of beginning dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Dialysis facility or preprinted chart orders for vaccination may improve vaccination rates for hepatitis, as well as pneumococcus, in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Because of the generally low response rate among patients with ESRD, multiple attempts have been made to enhance the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine. These include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3,23-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doubling the dose of vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving booster doses of vaccine in response to a fall in antibody titer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attempting to increase the immune response either by changing the mode of injection (intradermal versus intramuscular) or by adding immunostimulants or adjuvants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. As an example, one multicenter study randomly assigned 300 patients with CKD to four doses of hepatitis B ASO4 vaccine (zero, one, two, and six months) or three doses of hepatitis B ASO2V vaccine (zero, one, and six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The two vaccines are associated with different adjuvants. At 12 months, the ASO2V vaccine, compared with the ASO4 vaccine, was associated with a significantly more rapid and robust response, with seroconversion rates of 77 and 39 percent at two months and 94 and 79 percent at 12 months, respectively. Thus, three doses of the hepatitis B ASO2V vaccine provide rapid and persistent protection against HBV among patients with CKD.

In a retrospective cohort study, protective antibody titers developed in 62 of 116 HIV-infected patients (54 percent) who received three doses of the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]; this rate was comparable with that observed among 220 randomly selected non-HIV-infected dialysis patients (50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Nearly 70 percent of the HIV-infected responders maintained protective antibody titers at six months. Among those in whom titers remain &lt;10 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> after the standard three doses, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends the administration of a fourth injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER VACCINATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with the data available concerning hepatitis B vaccine, there is less information concerning the response of patients ESRD to tetanus, pneumococcus, influenza, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), H1N1, human papillomavirus (HPV), and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> vaccines. The antibody response to these vaccines is generally less than in patients without renal failure, mirroring the experience with hepatitis B vaccination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The few data available concerning tetanus vaccine suggest that the response in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less than in patients with normal renal function. A prospective, controlled study evaluated the response to tetanus and hepatitis B vaccines among 23 patients with CKD, 27 dialysis patients, 7 transplant recipients, and 15 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. All healthy individuals and six of seven transplant recipients seroconverted after three doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine; by comparison, antibodies developed in only 69 and 55 percent of patients on dialysis and those with CKD, respectively. If present, antibody titers were lower in the groups with renal failure than in controls without kidney disease. Patients who had previously responded to hepatitis B vaccine were more likely to respond to tetanus vaccine, implying that a subset of patients has a more intact immune system. Despite the reduced response to tetanus vaccine, most dialysis patients develop antibodies, thereby making vaccination effective for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumococcal vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine is diminished among patients with renal failure, particularly maintenance of adequate antibody titers. In a study of pneumococcal vaccination in 44 children and young adults with CKD, 83 percent developed a sufficient antibody response at four weeks (antibody titer &gt;200 int. units and at least a fourfold rise in postvaccine antibody titer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, at six months after vaccination, only 68 percent of patients maintained a sufficient immune response, and, at one year, only 48 percent had antibody titers &gt;200 int. units. Revaccination in 11 of 22 patients resulted in an immune response with antibody titers &gt;200 int. units, but a rapid decline in antibody titers again occurred over the ensuing six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A retrospective study has suggested that vaccination against pneumococcal disease is associated with decreased mortality among ESRD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], but the interpretation of this study, like all observational studies, is limited by selection bias since patients who receive timely vaccinations are more likely to display other behaviors that benefit health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Maintenance of adequate antibody titers in ESRD patients has also been demonstrated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Although only 17 patients were studied, the overall rate response to each vaccine serotype varied from 23.5 to 94.1 percent two months postvaccination, falling to 23.5 to 65 percent at 12 months postvaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>As with the other vaccines, pneumococcal vaccination is recommended in patients with ESRD despite the variable antibody response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2,3,8,20,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8,20,48</a>]. Despite this, it has been estimated that only 16 percent of dialysis patients were vaccinated in 2003 to 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Between 2006 and 2015, 53 percent of incident hemodialysis patients received pneumococcal vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Specific recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in patients with ESRD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults#H3908550515\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'PCV13 and PPSV23'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antibody response to influenza vaccine in chronic hemodialysis patients is lower than in the general population: Reportedly, 33 to 90 percent of patients develop a fourfold increase in antibody titers after vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. This response, unlike that to other vaccines, is not significantly different from that observed in controls, although the number of dialysis patients studied is relatively small.</p><p>It is not known whether the influenza vaccine reduces morbidity or mortality among ESRD patients. Some studies have suggested that the vaccination was associated with a decreased incidence of pneumonia, influenza, and all-cause hospitalization and with improved survival among such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/45,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,54</a>]. However, these results may have been confounded by unmeasured prognostic variables. Another study attempted to control for unmeasured variables by comparing outcomes of patients who received the vaccine during matched years (1998, 1999, and 2001), during which time the vaccine was well matched to the circulating influenza strain, with patients vaccinated during an unmatched year (1997), when the vaccine strain did not match the circulating strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Relative to patients vaccinated during the mismatched year, there was no reduction in the rate of influenza, hospitalization, or death among patients vaccinated during the matched year.</p><p>The latter study suggests that the immunization strategy for influenza may be ineffective among ESRD patients and that more effective strategies should be investigated. A study of 2089 incident peritoneal dialysis patients vaccinated for influenza and compared with propensity-matched controls showed that the vaccinated patients had a 34 percent reduction in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Mortality fell by 72 percent if the vaccinated patients received multiyear influenza vaccine. The vaccinated peritoneal dialysis patients also had lower rates of hospitalization, sepsis, and intensive care unit admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, one review continues to emphasize the low quality of evidence in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Despite these limited data, however, we suggest yearly influenza vaccination for all chronic dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,3,8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,8,20</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A study of 57 girls aged 9 to 21 years with CKD (n = 25), on dialysis (n = 9), and post-kidney transplantation (n = 23) who received the standard three-dose HPV vaccine found 100 percent antibody response at &lt;12 months and &ge;12 months post-three doses in girls with CKD and on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The maintenance of the antibody response was significantly less in the transplanted girls, prompting the authors to call for additional study in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43162024\"><span class=\"h2\">Rabies vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If indicated, dialysis patients should also be vaccinated for rabies. One study demonstrated the effectiveness of the immunological response of well-dialyzed hemodialysis patients who received intradermal rabies vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to use rabies prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recipients of renal transplants respond to vaccines in a manner similar to chronic dialysis patients: The antibody response is often less than in patients without kidney disease, and protective antibody titers fall rapidly. Immunizations in renal and nonrenal solid organ transplant patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7203538\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a reduced response to vaccination because of the general suppression of the immune system associated with uremia. Compared with vaccination in patients without ESRD, dialysis patients have a lower antibody titer and an inability to maintain adequate antibody titers over time. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the development and, especially, the duration of protective antibody titers in response to vaccine administration in dialysis patients are often suboptimal, recommendations are to vaccinate ESRD patients against hepatitis B. The antibody response to hepatitis B may be improved by vaccinating early in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD), doubling the dose of vaccine administered, giving an additional dose, and giving an early booster dose with a fall in antibody titer. Adjuvants to boost the immune response may prove useful but are not yet widely available or used. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B virus vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to pneumococcal vaccine is diminished among patients with CKD, particularly maintenance of adequate antibody titers. Despite this, pneumococcal vaccination is recommended in patients with ESRD. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pneumococcal vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The required shorter duration of influenza antibodies suggests that all dialysis patients should receive an influenza vaccine on a yearly basis. Limited evidence suggests that H1N1 vaccine is safe and effective in hemodialysis patients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Influenza vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little information about other vaccines in the dialysis population, but vaccinations for human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes zoster should be considered, especially in patients on transplant waiting lists. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Human papillomavirus vaccine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Varicella-zoster virus vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rodby RA, Trenholme GM.
