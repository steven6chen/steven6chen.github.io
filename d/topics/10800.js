For patients with residual or recurrent disease after primary surgery or for those with distant metastases, the most appropriate treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy) is less clear.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the role of surgery as primary therapy and the approaches to treating patients with persistent or recurrent MTC after surgery. The approach outlined below is largely in agreement with American Thyroid Association (ATA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

This evaluation is reviewed briefly below and in more detail elsewhere.

Among patients with either sporadic or familial tumors, those with higher preoperative serum calcitonin concentrations have larger tumors and are less likely to have normal serum concentrations after surgery than those with lower preoperative values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonography of the neck to assess for local and regional disease.

However, prophylactic central neck dissection is not required in patients with small intrathyroidal MTCs with a preoperative calcitonin &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> as metastatic lymph nodes are exceedingly rare in this circumstance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether or not to perform lateral neck dissections in the absence of clinically or ultrasonographically identifiable lymph node metastases as part of the primary surgery remains controversial. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines committee could not achieve a consensus agreement on this topic but did recommend that prophylactic lateral neck dissections &quot;may be considered based on serum calcitonin levels&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some members recommended against routine prophylactic lateral neck dissections if there was no evidence of disease on preoperative neck ultrasound. Other members utilized preoperative calcitonin values to guide the extent of prophylactic neck dissections by recommending prophylactic ipsilateral central and ipsilateral lateral neck dissection for patients with basal serum calcitonin values &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> and prophylactic dissection of uninvolved contralateral lateral neck compartments for serum calcitonin &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evidence of cervical lymph node involvement</strong> &ndash; For patients with MTC involving the thyroid and known cervical lymph nodal involvement preoperatively, total thyroidectomy with bilateral central compartment dissection and dissection of the involved lateral neck compartment(s) is the preferred initial treatment. In addition to compartment-oriented dissection of the clinically involved ipsilateral neck, prophylactic neck dissection of uninvolved contralateral neck compartments should also be considered in patients with a basal calcitonin levels greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> if there is no evidence of distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Up to 10 percent of patients with sporadic MTC and all patients with inherited MTC have bilateral or multifocal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; in addition, the latter all have premalignant diffuse C cell hyperplasia. Thus, total thyroidectomy rather than unilateral lobectomy is the preferred surgical approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MTC usually spreads to the central neck nodes. In one study of 101 consecutive patients with MTC (and no previous surgery), lymph node metastases to the central compartment were seen in approximately 50 percent of both sporadic (n = 54) and hereditary (n = 47) cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, metastatic spread to central neck lymph nodes is exceedingly rare if the preoperative basal calcitonin is &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In addition, metastases to the ipsilateral and contralateral jugulocarotid chains have been noted in 57 and 28 percent, and 36 and 19 percent of the sporadic and hereditary cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In another study, ipsilateral nodes were found in 10 percent of patients with no central node involvement, 77 percent of patients with one to three central nodes, and 98 percent of patients with more than four central nodes; contralateral nodes were found in 4.9 percent of patients with no central nodes, 38 percent of patients with one to nine central nodes, and 77 percent with more than nine central nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In retrospective series, patient treated with total thyroidectomy with central neck lymph node dissection required fewer reoperations than those receiving lesser procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As a result, routine bilateral dissection of the adjacent nodal tissue in the central compartment from the hyoid bone to the innominate veins and medial to the jugular veins is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The lateral jugular and mediastinal nodes should be carefully evaluated, followed by modified neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinal dissections if positive nodes are identified. Prophylactic neck dissection of the lateral neck in the absence of structurally identifiable disease is not routinely recommended, but it should be considered if extensive lymph node metastases are identified in the adjacent central neck or the preoperative serum calcitonin is &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The approach to these surgical procedures is detailed elsewhere.

Since the goals of surgery are largely palliative in this setting, a less aggressive surgical approach to the thyroid primary and to lymph node dissection in the central and lateral neck compartments may be warranted in order not to impair speech, swallowing, parathyroid function, and shoulder mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the presence of grossly invasive disease, more extended procedures with resection of involved neck structures may be appropriate in properly selected patients, but function-preserving (speech, swallowing) approaches are preferred. Disfiguring radical neck dissections do not improve prognosis and are not indicated. The surgical approach should be individualized based upon the patient's wishes, life expectancy, and other medical comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458970\"><span class=\"h2\">MTC diagnosed after lobectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If MTC is diagnosed postoperatively after a unilateral lobectomy, management options include completion thyroidectomy (eg, removal of the remaining thyroid tissue) or observation with monitoring of serum calcitonin levels. Because patients with hereditary MTC uniformly have bilateral disease, all patients with hereditary MTC should have a completion thyroidectomy. </p><p>The approach in patients with sporadic MTC is less certain, and there are few data to guide management decisions. The incidence of bilateral disease in patients with sporadic MTC is low, ranging from 0 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,11</a>]. Therefore, completion thyroidectomy is not routinely indicated in patients without a germline <em>RET</em> mutation. However, we do perform completion thyroidectomy in sporadic MTC if the postoperative serum calcitonin is elevated above the upper normal value of the reference range, or if there is imaging evidence of persistent disease in the thyroid or regional lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2716443\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitor for postoperative complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after surgery, the patient should be monitored closely for the development of hypoparathyroidism or injury to either the recurrent or superior laryngeal nerves.

The adequacy of therapy should be evaluated clinically and by measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in six weeks. The goal of T4 therapy should be to restore and maintain a euthyroid state; suppression of serum TSH concentrations is not indicated in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) because C cells are not TSH responsive. Similarly, adjuvant therapy with radioiodine is contraindicated, because the tumor cells do not concentrate iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2716852\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of tumor samples for somatic mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic mutations in <em>RET</em>, <em>HRAS</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, or rarely, <em>NRAS</em>, can be identified in tumors of patients with sporadic MTC.

Thirty to 55 percent of patients with palpable medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or nonpalpable but macroscopic MTC who undergo attempted curative resection have persistently high serum calcitonin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5,7,21,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,21,28,29</a>].</p><p>The prognosis for patients with postoperative hypercalcitoninemia depends primarily upon the patient's age and the extent of disease at the time of initial surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,19,21,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,21,30-32</a>].

In addition, for patients with persistent elevation, assessment of calcitonin and CEA doubling times provide sensitive markers for progression and aggressiveness of metastatic MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Therefore, neck ultrasound with or without additional cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the neck) should be performed to evaluate for the presence of persistent macroscopic metastatic disease. Serum calcitonin and CEA are measured every 6 to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If imaging is positive, meticulous dissection of all cytologically confirmed local and regional nodal tissue can be considered if there is no evidence of disease outside of the neck or mediastinum. As in the primary surgical setting, compartment-oriented neck dissections are recommended when surgery is performed for cytologically confirmed loco-regional disease. More focused neck dissections may be appropriate in previously dissected neck compartments. However, outside of centers experienced in managing these patients, only those with overt disease in the neck and no distant metastases should undergo neck dissection in this setting.

Additional imaging should be considered in patients with rising calcitonin and CEA values, with the type and frequency of testing based on both the magnitude and rate of rise of the these biochemical markers.

Therefore, patients with postoperative calcitonin levels that are &ge;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> should undergo neck ultrasound and additional imaging (CT or MRI of neck, chest, and abdomen; bone scan or bone MRI in patients suspected of having skeletal metastases) to identify possible distant metastases. The liver is the most common site of metastases in patients with MTC, occurring in approximately 45 percent of patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Liver metastases are best identified with three-phase contrast-enhanced liver CT or contrast-enhanced liver MRI. Other sites include bone, brain, and lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If imaging is negative, monitoring with physical exam, measurement of serum calcitonin and CEA, and evaluation of the neck with ultrasonography should continue. The frequency of repeating imaging studies will be dependent on the magnitude and rate of rise of the calcitonin and CEA values. As an example, patients with stable postoperative serum calcitonin values in the 150 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> range are usually followed with yearly neck ultrasound for several years, reserving repeat cross-sectional imaging (neck, chest, abdomen) looking for distant metastases in those patients with rising calcitonin or CEA values. 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans are considered only when the serum calcitonin is higher than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. In one report of 28 patients with MTC, PET had a sensitivity of 78 percent when calcitonin was &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> but failed to detect disease if calcitonin was &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radionuclide bone imaging can be helpful in selected cases when cross-sectional imaging fails to identify the source of the persistent hypercalcitoninemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Attempted localization of disease by catheterization of the hepatic veins, both internal jugular veins, and the innominate veins, with measurements of serum calcitonin before and after calcium stimulation or laparoscopic examination of the liver, is rarely considered and only if these findings would impact clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If imaging is positive, treatment depends upon the site of disease and may include surgical resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).

In the past, patients with identifiable residual or recurrent medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) were operated on routinely. However, despite routine lymphadenectomy or excision of palpable tumor, their serum calcitonin concentrations often did not normalize after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This has led to a more critical evaluation of the need for and timing of therapeutic interventions and re-evaluation of the role of cautious observation in properly selected patients. The following approach to management of residual disease is based upon observational studies and clinical experience.</p><p>The recommended treatment approach for <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/recurrent</span> disease depends upon a variety of clinical factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not the disease can be localized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise location(s) of the metastatic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not the disease is causing symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate (or likelihood) of clinically significant structural disease progression</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18452937\"><span class=\"h3\">Small volume, asymptomatic</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biochemical evidence of disease without structural correlate</strong> &ndash; Patients with detectable calcitonin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values without structurally identifiable disease are best followed with observation. The extent and frequency of cross-sectional imaging is dependent on the magnitude and doubling time of calcitonin and CEA (see <a href=\"#H9088928\" class=\"local\">'Persistent hypercalcitoninemia'</a> above). In the absence of structurally identifiable disease, we do not suggest additional surgery or systemic therapies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of gross residual disease, we also do not recommend routine use of postoperative EBRT as adjuvant therapy, even if the postoperative calcitonin and CEA values are abnormal. We reserve adjuvant EBRT for very select patients with extensive preoperative gross extrathyroidal extension or large volume, multicompartment macroscopic lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lack of randomized prospective trials makes it difficult to provide definitive recommendations with regard to the use of EBRT as adjuvant therapy. We feel that EBRT in this setting may improve loco-regional control but are not convinced that there is an overall survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Furthermore, the potential benefits of improved loco-regional control must be weighed against the wide range of acute and chronic toxicities associated with EBRT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a retrospective study of 51 patients with persistently elevated calcitonin (ranging from 540 to 400,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> and no evidence of residual disease, the local relapse rate was significantly lower in those who were treated with radiation therapy because of advanced local disease at presentation (29 versus 59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There was no difference in 10-year survival between the two groups (72 versus 60 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small</strong> <strong>volume residual disease outside of cervical lymph nodes (thyroid bed or soft tissue metastases)</strong> &ndash; Small volume disease outside of cervical lymph nodes is usually the result of gross extrathyroidal extension into major structures in the neck, and it often reflects microscopic disease remaining after all macroscopic disease has been surgically resected (R1 resection). Usually, this is microscopic disease involving muscle, the airway, esophagus, soft tissues in the neck, or thyroid bed. As these patients are at high risk of loco-regional recurrence, we suggest external beam irradiation as adjuvant therapy in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Structurally identifiable small volume disease can also be a manifestation of an early soft tissue recurrence of MTC, in which case the initial treatment option would be surgical resection, which is then usually followed by EBRT (or occasionally EBRT alone if surgery is unlikely to be successful or likely to result in unacceptable morbidity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retrospective analyses have suggested that radiotherapy may prolong the interval until disease progression or recurrence in some patients. In one retrospective series, as an example, the 10-year rate of control of local and regional disease was 86 percent in patients with residual microscopic neck disease who received postoperative radiotherapy versus 52 percent in those who were not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small volume lymph node metastases </strong>&ndash; For most MTC patients with persistent, asymptomatic small volume locoregional disease (subcentimeter lymph node metastases), we suggest active surveillance as the best management option. Reoperation is frequently not curative and can be associated with morbidity (ie, hypoparathyroidism, injury to recurrent laryngeal nerve or accessory nerve). In addition, observation of asymptomatic, stable lymph node metastases is nearly always recommended if the basal serum calcitonin is &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> or if more than five metastatic lymph nodes were removed with a previous surgery, as reoperation is almost never curative in these settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients are followed with serial cross-sectional imaging at 6 to 12 month intervals, and surgical intervention is reserved for patients that have documented structural disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small volume distant metastases</strong> &ndash; Similar to asymptomatic small volume lymph node metastases, small volume distant metastases (subcentimeter metastatic foci) are usually followed with observation. It is not uncommon for small pulmonary and liver metastases to remain asymptomatic and progress very slowly (or not all) over many years.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18453273\"><span class=\"h3\">Large volume or symptomatic</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macroscopic gross residual disease in the thyroid bed or cervical soft tissue metastases</strong> &ndash; If the gross residual disease is confirmed to be unresectable or if the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/treatment</span> team agree that a complete surgical resection would produce unacceptable morbidity, we suggest external beam irradiation to improve loco-regional control. While systemic therapy (such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors) can be considered in this setting, our preference is to use EBRT to achieve local regional control as the initial treatment unless there are other pressing indications to begin systemic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic or large volume loco-regional lymph node disease</strong> &ndash; Resection of large volume loco-regional lymph node disease may be necessary to prevent invasion into surrounding major structures. Occasionally, lymph node metastases can present as painful lesions that can be readily palliated with surgical resection. However, since additional surgery rarely achieves a biochemical cure if the basal serum calcitonin is &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> or if more than five metastatic lymph nodes were removed with a previous surgery, cautious observation or systemic therapies (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) can be considered for asymptomatic large volume lymph node metastases detected in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic or large volume distant metastasis</strong> &ndash; Rather than immediately initiating systemic therapy, we prefer to treat individual (or a few) isolated symptomatic or large volume distant metastases with locally directed therapies such as surgical resection, external beam irradiation, embolization, or radiofrequency ablation. For patients with symptomatic or progressive metastatic disease that cannot be effectively treated by locally directed therapies, systemic treatment with biologic response modifiers (ie, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) may improve progression-free survival. Kinase inhibitors are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Chemotherapy and immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Locally directed therapies are recommended in the following clinical settings: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large volume solitary metastatic lesions in the lung, liver, or brain should be considered for surgical resection. Radiofrequency ablation may be an option for smaller peripheral lung metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oligometastatic lesions in the bone can be treated with surgical resection, EBRT, embolization, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiresorptive agents (eg, bisphosphonates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>). EBRT is often utilized to palliate painful bone metastases or decrease the risk of fracture from progressive growth of a bone metastasis.

Dietary measures such as avoiding alcohol intake and maintaining a diet that limits high fiber foods can be augmented with anti-motility agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenoxylate-and-atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenoxylate-atropine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) as first-line therapy. Somatostatin analogs may provide modest symptomatic improvement in some patients. In selected patients, debulking of large tumor deposits with surgery or chemoembolization may improve diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ectopic Cushing's syndrome</strong> &ndash; We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vandetanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vandetanib</a> (prior to medical or surgical adrenalectomy) as first-line therapy for ectopic Cushing's syndrome, based on recent reports of a very rapid decline in serum cortisol levels in several patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

In our experience, medical therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>) is generally suboptimally effective and poorly tolerated. Tumor debulking is unlikely to be effective, as these patients usually have multiple sites of large volume disease. Conversely, we find that bilateral adrenalectomy is well tolerated and effective but challenging given the comorbidities associated with large volume MTC and hypercortisolism.

The 10-year survival rates for patients with stages I, II, III, and IV medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) are 100, 93, 71, and 21 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>].</p><p>A nomogram that integrates age, gender, postoperative calcitonin, vascular invasion, tumor, node, and metastasis status has been developed that can be used to easily predict cause-specific mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Furthermore, using an approach previously validated in non-medullary thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], a response to therapy stratification system was shown to have a higher proportion of variance explained (PVE) for predicting clinical outcomes than the TNM (tumor, node, and <span class=\"nowrap\">metastasis)/American</span> Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>Calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) doubling times provide sensitive markers for progression and aggressiveness of metastatic MTC. Calcitonin doubling times less than 6 to 12 months are associated with poor survival, while doubling times &gt;24 months are associated with a very favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Controlling for the effect of age, the prognosis of patients with inherited disease is probably similar to those with sporadic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

As an example, patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) (germline <em>RET</em> mutation codon 918) are more likely to have invasive disease, and therefore a worse prognosis, than those with either classical multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) or familial MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The goal of T4 therapy is to restore and maintain euthyroidism. Suppression of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations is not indicated in patients with MTC because C cells are not TSH-responsive. Similarly, adjuvant therapy with radioiodine is not indicated, because the tumor cells do not concentrate iodine.
