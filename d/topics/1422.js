The estimated prevalence of chronic pain in populations undergoing cancer treatment ranges from 33 to 59 percent, and it is considerably higher (64 to 74 percent) in patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Given the high prevalence of cancer pain and its potential for profound adverse consequences, all patients with active malignancy should be routinely screened for pain. Patients who report pain require a more comprehensive assessment and specific treatment.</p><p>This topic review will cover cancer pain assessment. Classification of the different syndromes of pain in cancer patients and treatment of cancer-related pain are addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CANCER PAIN ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer pain assessment is a complex undertaking. The evaluation begins with a thorough history of both the pain and the underlying malignancy as well as its treatment. Because of the potential impact of pain on quality of life, it is also essential to determine the adverse effects of pain on physical and psychosocial wellbeing, as well as the spiritual impact of the pain. Cancer pain may linger after the cancer is removed (as examples, post mastectomy, post amputation or post thoracotomy syndrome), and this may have important psychological and spiritual impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;, section on 'Postsurgical pain syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, other physical symptoms and both medical and psychiatric comorbidities should be characterized, as they may be independent targets for therapy. The painful site should be examined in detail and other physical findings relevant to the patient's medical status (both in terms of the cancer and medical comorbidities) should be noted.</p><p>The patient's description of the pain, findings on physical examination, objective data from imaging and other tests, and information about the extent of the malignant disease and its treatment are all utilized to assess the likely etiology and underlying pathophysiology of the pain, and if possible, identify a specific cancer pain syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is a subjective and multidimensional experience. To optimize care, the pain report should be characterized in terms of multiple domains, beginning with clinically relevant descriptors: intensity, temporal features, location and patterns of radiation, quality, and factors that provoke or relieve the pain. This information may be sufficient to identify a specific pain syndrome (ie, a constellation of clinically meaningful signs and symptoms) that may help to elucidate the etiology, direct the diagnostic evaluation, clarify the prognosis, and suggest the appropriate therapeutic interventions. While the disease process may not be reversible, particularly for metastatic disease, the pain is often reversible with specific treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This information may also allow for inferences regarding the underlying pathophysiology, or it may suggest and guide the need for more information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the clinical setting, pain intensity is often measured simply by using a verbal rating scale (eg, &quot;mild,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;severe&quot;) or a numeric scale (eg, &quot;how severe has your pain been, on average, during the past week, on a scale of zero to ten, where zero is no pain and ten is the worst pain you can imagine?&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82442\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef82442 \">form 1</a>)). A visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a continuous line, usually 10 cm long and anchored on the ends by &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst possible pain,&quot; also may be used. Pain intensity should be tracked over time using the same rating scale and specific time frame (eg, &quot;pain right now,&quot; &quot;during the past day,&quot; or during the past week&quot;).</p><p>Formal instruments also have been developed that describe pain in multiple dimensions. An example is the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), a patient self-rating scale that assesses pain intensity and pain interference in various areas of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A short-form version of the BPI is available <a href=\"http://www.npcrc.org/files/news/briefpain_short.pdf&amp;token=d1E87fR+zD9gaRF8GHPU1UzwuJ+jFpML/+oo6E539bREITRC/JwpXm3gRM9SwP4VmYpgSAO2ox2ErR4inrQEsw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2795\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(BPI-SF)</a>. An older tool is the McGill Pain Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which assesses the sensory, affective and evaluative components of pain. A <a href=\"http://hypnosishelpcenter.net/McGillPainQuestionnaire-Short.pdf&amp;token=kQPx4e002OcKrPGGmWc8iszwA3MnrNZJasSmzfqjD4Iy1wE00Ft47HrE3FnkT/osttI4YXFoqN29Gt4CgcEVzdGHH1DVJw3L3eRdnVzrxtk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2795\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">shortened version</a> is available. Both the McGill pain questionnaire and the BPI have been translated into several languages. Yet another is the Memorial Pain Assessment Card, which measures pain intensity, pain relief, and mood on simple VAS and verbal scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, others have used the impact of pain on quality of life measures to propose classification of pain intensity from bone metastases as mild (pain score of 1 to 5), moderate (pain score 6), or severe (score 7 to 10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis#H13163467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of adult patients with bone metastasis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Temporal assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporal assessment of the pain may include information about type of onset, duration, course, and daily fluctuation. Acute pain syndromes usually have a well-defined onset and a readily identifiable cause (eg, surgery). The pain is expected to run its course in a short time frame and management typically focuses on symptomatic relief until this happens.</p><p>In contrast, chronic pain is often characterized by an ill-defined onset and a prolonged, fluctuating course. Overt pain behaviors (eg, grimacing) and sympathetic hyperactivity are typically absent, but vegetative signs, including lassitude, sleep disturbance, and anorexia, may be present. The patient usually does not appear to be in pain, and the only definitive way to determine the presence of pain is to obtain a verbal report from the patient.</p><p>Most patients with chronic cancer pain also experience periodic flares of pain, often referred to as &quot;breakthrough pain&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. One important subtype of breakthrough pain is &quot;incident pain,&quot; which is a pain flare that is precipitated by voluntary activity. The recognition of breakthrough pain as a significant problem in cancer patients led to the concept of so-called &quot;rescue&quot; dosing, ie, doses of a short-acting opioid administered on an as-needed basis to manage pain flares during long-term opioid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;, section on 'Management of breakthrough pain'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids#H434000920\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute pain in the patient chronically using opioids&quot;, section on 'Empiric treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Other aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other pain characteristics are important to assess. The quality of the pain (eg, aching, sharp, stabbing, burning, etc.) provides information that may help distinguish between nociceptive and neuropathic pain syndromes (see below). The assessment of pain location and referral patterns, and identification of specific factors that can provoke or reduce pain may help to clarify the etiology and elucidate a treatment approach that includes management of precipitants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pain in a cancer patient usually, but not always, has a cause related to the disease itself or its diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment (ie, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery). Identifying the etiology can clarify the status of disease, potentially altering the prognosis or informing the plan of care for treatment. Furthermore, clarifying the etiology of pain can sometimes reveal an opportunity for disease-modifying therapy that may provide some analgesic benefit. As an example, radiation therapy is often performed with pain relief as the primary goal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the etiology of pain is related to the disease, it usually involves direct invasion of pain-sensitive structures by the neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Bone is the most common pain-sensitive structure affected by the tumor. Other etiologies include injury to or invasion of a component of the nervous system, obstruction of a hollow viscus, distention of organ capsules, distortion or occlusion of blood vessels, or infiltration of adjacent soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inferred pathophysiology (types of cancer pain)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effort to identify an etiology for the pain implies the characterization of a medically verifiable lesion or disorder that is driving the neural processes that culminate in the experience of pain. In contrast, the effort to characterize the pathophysiology of pain does not attempt to identify a verifiable disease state, but rather, supports an inference about the types of pathophysiological processes that may be sustaining the pain.</p><p>Although these processes cannot be definitively determined in patients, clinicians are able to integrate findings from the pain history, physical examination, and objective tests to draw these inferences and apply broad labels, such as &quot;nociceptive&quot; or &quot;neuropathic&quot; pain. These labels represent a gross simplification of very complex neurophysiologic and neurochemical processes, but are conventionally accepted because clinical experience and a large body of clinical research literature indicates that this categorization can be useful in suggesting specific treatment approaches.</p><p>The inferred pathophysiologies for cancer pain may be designated as nociceptive, neuropathic, or psychogenic; mixed disorders are extremely common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Those disorders that cannot be categorized are called idiopathic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Nociceptive pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nociceptive pain is sustained predominantly by ongoing tissue injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic nociceptive pain involves injury to somatic structures like bone, joints, or muscles. It is often described by patients as &quot;aching,&quot; &quot;stabbing,&quot; &quot;throbbing,&quot; or &quot;pressure-like&quot; in quality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visceral nociceptive pain involves injury to viscera. It is usually characterized as &quot;gnawing&quot; or &quot;crampy&quot; when arising from the obstruction of a hollow viscus (eg, the bowel lumen), and as &quot;aching&quot; or &quot;stabbing&quot; when arising from other visceral structures, such as organ capsules, myocardium, or pleura.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropathic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is labeled as neuropathic if the results of the evaluation suggest that it is sustained by abnormal somatosensory processing in the peripheral or central nervous system. Neuropathic mechanisms are involved in approximately 40 percent of cancer pain syndromes, and can be caused by either the disease or its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Dysesthesias, uncomfortable sensations that are perceived as abnormal and described using terms such as &quot;burning,&quot; &quot;shock-like,&quot; or &quot;electrical,&quot; suggest an underlying neuropathic mechanism for the pain. Physical examination findings of allodynia (ie, pain induced by non-painful stimuli), hyperalgesia (ie, increased perception of painful stimuli), or other sensory findings also suggest the presence of neuropathic pain. Patients may have other concomitant neurological findings, such as weakness or changes in reflexes, and some patients have autonomic dysfunction within the anatomic distribution of the pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881353016\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychogenic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;psychogenic pain&quot; is used to describe pain that is believed to be sustained predominantly by psychological factors. It does not refer to the common observation that pain experienced by some patients is exacerbated by psychological factors, or that they have pain-related distress or comorbid psychiatric disease. Rather, psychogenic pain is related to other disorders characterized by prominent somatic symptoms associated with significant distress and impairment. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), by the American Psychiatric Association, classifies a disorder such as this as a &quot;somatic symptom disorder with prominent pain,&quot; which is diagnosed on the basis of excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to pain that are distressing or impair functioning, and appear out of proportion to the physical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-cancer-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Psychogenic pain appears to be rare in the cancer population. The label should not be applied unless the assessment reveals evidence of psychopathology that is believed to be specifically related to the occurrence of the pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

If the cause is apparent, no further assessment may be needed. On the other hand, cancer patients with chronic pain are more challenging because of the heterogeneity in specific cancer diagnoses, disease activity, past and present history of disease-modifying therapies, prior evaluation and efforts at pain control, impact of pain on quality of life, and existence of relevant medical and psychiatric comorbidities.</p><p>This complexity calls for a systematic approach to assessment.
