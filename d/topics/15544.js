Seizures may be the initial manifestation of a brain tumor or may occur during the course of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H728505824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Seizures'</a>.)</p><p>The main factors that influence the incidence of seizures are tumor type, grade, and location:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with primary brain tumors, seizures are more common with low-grade tumors than with high-grade tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence rates of epilepsy in a series of 1028 patients with primary brain tumors were 85, 69, and 49 percent among patients with low-grade glioma, anaplastic glioma, and glioblastoma, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other studies have found that at least one seizure occurs in up to 80 percent of patients with high-grade glioma at some time during the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic characteristics of gliomas may also influence seizure propensity. In one study, patients with gliomas harboring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) were more than twice as likely to present with seizure as those with <em>IDH1</em>-wildtype gliomas (59 to 74 percent versus 18 to 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Preclinical studies suggested that D-2-hydroxyglutarate, a byproduct of the mutant IDH1 enzyme, was epileptogenic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas#H15072634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular pathogenesis of diffuse gliomas&quot;, section on 'Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other less common low-grade tumor types also appear to have a high incidence of seizures. As an example, ganglioglioma and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) have an incidence of seizures greater than 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are less common in patients with metastatic lesions compared with those with primary brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. In a retrospective series that included 470 patients with brain metastases, seizures were diagnosed in 24 percent at some point during the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Seizures were most common in melanoma (67 percent) and least common in breast cancer (16 percent). Lung (29 percent) and unknown primary sources (25 percent) were intermediate. The high rate of seizures in patients with melanoma may reflect the tendency of melanoma to involve the cerebral cortex and to hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical situations in which the risk of seizures may be relatively higher include patients with metastases involving areas of high epileptogenicity such as the motor cortex or when metastases involve both the brain and leptomeninges. </p><p/><p>Seizures may be caused by factors other than metastases in patients with tumors arising outside the central nervous system (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Causes of seizure'</a>). Examples of other potential etiologies of seizures that are more common in cancer patients than in the general population include metabolic encephalopathies such as hyponatremia or hypoglycemia, opportunistic infections, or side effects of therapy. Paraneoplastic encephalitis is another potential cause of seizures in patients with systemic cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4357978\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures that arise in patients with brain tumors are either focal or secondarily generalized. The specific ictal and peri-ictal manifestations typically reflect the tumor's location within the brain and are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Patients with brain tumors can also develop status epilepticus, which may be either convulsive or nonconvulsive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) has been reported in patients with systemic cancer. The clinical manifestations of NCSE are often nonspecific, such as an altered personality or a decreased level of alertness. These can be difficult to distinguish from, and may coexist with, other causes of altered mental status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Case series emphasize that NCSE may occur in patients with systemic cancer who do not have intracranial metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. One study of patients with systemic cancer reported NCSE in 6 percent of those with impaired mental status; none had brain metastasis, and the origin of the seizure activity was presumably related to systemic factors such as metabolic encephalopathy (eg, hyponatremia or hypoglycemia), infection, or side effects of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Paraneoplastic encephalitis is another potential cause of seizures and altered mental status in a patient with systemic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4358123\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A new seizure should prompt a neuroimaging study (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] depending on the clinical setting) in a patient regardless of a known diagnosis of systemic cancer or primary brain tumor. Brain MRI has better sensitivity than CT; nevertheless, a CT scan is suitable to exclude a major change in the size of a tumor, hemorrhage, or large stroke under emergency situations or if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Seizures themselves, particularly if prolonged, can produce changes on brain MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), which broadens the differential for patients with brain tumors and new imaging abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance imaging changes related to acute seizure activity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An electroencephalogram (EEG) may not be required in a patient who has had a clinically obvious seizure and has recovered. EEG is also not routinely needed for those without clinical evidence of a seizure. However, EEG is essential for making the diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and should be considered in patients with systemic or brain cancer who have altered mental status.

There are no randomized trials that have established the superiority of one agent over others. To minimize toxicity, patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose of the antiseizure drug, and serum levels monitored, when applicable, at the recommended intervals. Potential interactions between the antiseizure drug and any chemotherapeutic agent should also be considered when choosing an antiseizure drug and monitoring levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F85983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85983 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Selection of an antiseizure drug'</a>.)</p><p>Antiseizure drugs with no or minimal hepatic enzyme-inducing or -inhibiting properties, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacosamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lacosamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, are generally preferred for seizure treatment in this setting, since these agents have a more favorable safety profile compared with older agents and often have fewer problematic drug-drug interactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60182 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. As in the general epilepsy population, levetiracetam is generally well tolerated but can cause neuropsychiatric side effects, including irritability, agitation, and anxiety. Patients with frontal lobe tumors may be at highest risk for neuropsychiatric adverse effects on levetiracetam and should be monitored for new psychiatric symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Drug-drug interactions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Selection of an antiseizure drug'</a>.)</p><p>Of note, several observational studies, including one small prospective study, have suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> may be associated with improved survival when taken during radiation therapy in patients with glioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. However, a pooled analysis of &gt;1800 patients enrolled in four randomized trials for newly diagnosed glioblastoma found no difference in overall survival among patients taking valproate compared with those who were not (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.80-1.15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> was not associated with improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], in contrast with results of a separate, smaller observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other studies have found that valproate may also be associated with a higher rate of hematologic toxicity that can lead to treatment delays. Preferential use of valproate over other antiseizure drugs in patients with high-grade gliomas therefore does not seem justified. </p><p>The initial use of multidrug regimens should be avoided whenever possible. Monotherapy increases the likelihood of compliance, provides a wider therapeutic window, and is more cost effective than combination drug treatment. There are fewer side effects and idiosyncratic reactions associated with single-drug therapy and drug-drug interactions are avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Subsequent drug trials'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients with tumor-related epilepsy will respond adequately to a single antiseizure drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If a patient experiences recurrent seizures after initiation of therapy, doses of the initial agent should be escalated and adequate serum concentrations should be verified before switching drugs or adding a second agent. If adequate seizure control cannot be obtained, an alternative antiseizure drug should be prescribed or a second antiseizure drug added. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacosamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lacosamide</a> has been increasingly studied as an adjunctive agent in brain tumor patients with refractory epilepsy and is generally well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. A variety of other agents are equally reasonable in this setting, taking into consideration mechanism of action, side effect profile, drug interactions, and concomitant medications.

Seizure control is an important potential benefit of treatment in patients with low-grade gliomas and other tumors, independent of tumor response and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Experts widely agree on gross total resection of a primary brain tumor with clear margins when this is feasible. A systematic review of 910 reported patients with low-grade glioneuronal tumors (gangliomas and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors [DNETs]) found that seizure remission was achieved after gross total resection in 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While some studies have suggested that extratemporal epilepsy may be more difficult to control with surgery compared with temporal lobe epilepsy, outcomes in this report were not different between those with temporal lobe versus extratemporal tumors. As has been suggested in other reports, extended resection of temporal lobe tumors with hippocampectomy conferred additional benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Prognostic factors that have been associated with improved seizure outcomes after brain tumor resection have been shorter duration of epilepsy prior to surgery, a single focus on electroencephalography (EEG), a single lesion on neuroimaging, and complete tumor resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a multicenter trial that compared early versus delayed radiotherapy for low-grade gliomas, early radiation treatment was associated with a lower seizure rate at one year (25 versus 41 percent), although it did not affect overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic therapy &ndash; There are reports of patients with low-grade primary brain tumors and epilepsy having improved seizure control and a few achieving seizure freedom with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> or nitrosoureas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].
