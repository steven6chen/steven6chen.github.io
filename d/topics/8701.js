A vast body of literature has identified roles for both host and microbial factors in the pathogenesis of IBD, ultimately leading to inappropriate immune responses to microbes residing in the intestinal lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will focus on our expanding understanding of the immune, microbial, and genetic factors involved in both the initiation and maintenance of IBD. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of IBD is discussed in detail separately.

To protect the host from the latter, the intestine relies upon an effective barrier and an innate and an acquired immune system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74195 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effective barrier depends upon an intact intestinal epithelium, with its overlying surface mucus secreted by goblet cells, normal peristalsis, and the secretion of numerous protective factors (eg, antimicrobial proteins, growth factors). Studies have shown that, in addition to their role in producing mucus, goblet cells actively participate in the delivery of antigens from the intestinal lumen to cells in the intestinal lamina propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The innate immune system is comprised of myeloid-derived cells (neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages), natural killer cells, and innate lymphoid cells. These cells, in addition to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and stromal cells, express so-called pattern recognition receptors, which bind stereotypic microbial products. In combination, these cells provide the initial response to either pathogenic or commensal micro-organisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adaptive immune system is comprised primarily of B and T lymphocytes, which confer specific immunity. The acquired immune system is designed to respond to foreign antigens displayed by &quot;professional&quot; antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (eg, dendritic cells and macrophages) in association with molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).</p><p/><p>Both humoral and cell-mediated mechanisms are involved in the acquired immune system. Humoral immunity is mediated by B cells within the gut, which secrete antibodies largely of the immunoglobulin (Ig) A class. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cellular immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes, which can be functionally divided into CD4<sup>+</sup> helperT-cells (Th), CD8<sup>+</sup> (cytotoxic), and regulatory T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells respond to processed antigen on professional APCs in association with MHC class II molecules. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells respond to processed antigen on all cell types in association with MHC class I molecules.</p><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells can be further subdivided functionally into various T-cell subsets that are, in part, defined by the cytokines they produce. Examples of these include Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, and regulatory T cells.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Th1 cells secrete predominantly interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-2. IL-12 (consisting of the heterodimer <span class=\"nowrap\">p35/p40)</span> is secreted by APCs and is critical for the generation of Th1 cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Th2 cells are induced by IL-4 and inhibited by IL-12. Th2 cells regulate B-cell differentiation by secreting predominantly IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Th17 cells are a lineage of helper T cells that have a critical role in regulating the inflammatory process and responses at mucosal surfaces and may have a central role in autoimmunity. Th17 cells secrete predominantly IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These cells are somewhat heterogeneous, such that subsets of Th17 cells also can secrete IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-10; the repertoire of combined cytokines help determine the behavior of Th17 cells at mucosal surfaces. The IL-12-related molecule, IL-23 (consisting of the heterodimer <span class=\"nowrap\">p19/p40),</span> is important for maintenance of Th17 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Mutations in the IL-23 receptor have been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Furthermore, targeting of both the p19 subunit (unique to IL-23) and the p40 subunit (common to both IL-12 and IL-23) has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for treatment of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], thereby highlighting the importance of these cytokines in IBD pathogenesis. In contrast, clinical trials blocking IL-17 in Crohn disease patients showed no efficacy, and, in fact, some patients developed worse disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Data have suggested that, in addition to pro-inflammatory activities, IL-17 has important roles in intestinal barrier function, which may have hindered clinical efficacy with anti-IL-17 targeted therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulatory T cells consist of various subsets including Th3, type 1 regulatory (Tr1), and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> (mediated at least in part by the expression of the forkhead box P3 transcription factor [FOXP3]). They block or downregulate Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells either by production of specific cytokines (IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta) or via cell-cell contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Immune cells, when located in the intestine, are collectively known as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are distributed throughout the lamina propria, between epithelial cells, and in discrete lymphoid structures. Epithelial cells, &quot;professional&quot; APCs, and other leukocytes within the GALT also secrete a variety of soluble protein mediators (cytokines), which serve to regulate responses to foreign antigens. In addition, alterations in the intestinal microcirculation, trafficking molecules, and neuronal afferents can modify the composition and effector function of both immune and non-immune cells within the GALT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1906409085\"><span class=\"h1\">KEY CONCEPTS EMERGING IN THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immune response components must be properly balanced. As such, either too strong a response or an inadequate immune response to microbes in the intestinal lumen can ultimately result in intestinal inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The layers of the intestinal immune system cooperate to defend against microbiota that gain access to intestinal tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the high density of resident microbes in the intestinal lumen, the intestinal immune system has developed mechanisms to control excessive responses to these microbes. Cells in the intestinal immune system exhibit unique characteristics that are, in part, conditioned through the local intestinal environment. Examples of unique phenotypes of macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells within intestinal tissues:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Relative to the peripheral immune system, macrophages in the intestinal lamina propria do not produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines upon exposure to microbial components, but are more effective in clearing bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These combined characteristics likely contribute to eliminating bacteria in a manner that minimizes tissue injury. Intestinal macrophages also demonstrate anti-inflammatory characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intestinal dendritic cells express high levels of retinoic acid-metabolizing enzymes. Retinoic acid, in turn, leads to enriched T-cell trafficking to intestinal tissues and regulatory T-cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mechanisms exist in intestinal tissues to eliminate T cells reactive to luminal bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and to differentiate T cells into regulatory T-cell subsets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While many distinct, differentiated intestinal immune cell subsets have been identified, a number of these same cells demonstrate plasticity. For example, Th17 cells can undergo transition to IL-10-producing regulatory T cells and Th2 cells, Th1 cells to Th2 cells, and Treg cells can transition to pathogenic IL-17-producing and IFN-gamma-producing T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. This has implications for therapy in IBD. On the one hand, it indicates that, when considering cell therapy with transfer of regulatory T-cell subsets for inhibiting inflammation, these cells may transition to pathogenic T cells rather than function in the protective manner intended. On the other hand, it provides possibilities for therapeutically inducing transition of pathogenic T cells to T cells with regulatory function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions in the intestinal environment can influence the manner in which immune cells differentiate, with inflammation, secreted mediators, microbiota, dietary factors, and prior infectious exposures all able to influence these differentiation outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/23,24,27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,27-34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE DYSREGULATION AND IBD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies support the concept that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a dysregulated response by the mucosal immune system to the microbiota that reside within the intestinal lumen. This dysregulation can be both due to excessive immune reactivity and to inadequate immune responses to intestinal microbiota, highlighting the importance of a balanced immune response. The following describe alterations in the immune responses observed in IBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2374267312\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysregulation at the epithelial barrier</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in intestinal mucus, high numbers of bacteria within mucus, and increased intestinal permeability have been associated with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/35-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-42</a>]. Studies have revealed that mice with defects in epithelial barrier function can develop spontaneous colitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> demonstrate increased susceptibility to experimental models of colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Epithelial cells can express some receptors also expressed on immune cells and can present antigens, similar to classical antigen-presenting cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. Some studies have shown that abnormal antigen presentation by epithelial cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interaction with intraepithelial lymphocytes is associated with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. Moreover, abnormalities in the manner in which epithelial cells (in particular, highly secretory cells such as Paneth cells) handle unfolded intracellular proteins, a process that is associated with &quot;stress&quot; on the endoplasmic reticulum, has been associated with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Other abnormalities in Paneth cells have been identified in association with various immune pathway perturbations observed in IBD, which in some cases result in dysregulation in production of antimicrobial proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H986436113\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysregulation in immune cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive immune cell recruitment and activation has been detected in multiple immune cell subsets.

Bidirectional host-microbe interactions in the intestine can be mutually beneficial or have adverse effects that contribute to intestinal inflammation. On the one hand, intestinal microbial colonization is essential to nutrition, energy metabolism, and proper &quot;conditioning&quot; of the intestinal and peripheral immune systems. On the other hand, the intestinal lumen can contain microbiota and microbial-derived factors that may promote inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the context of an underlying genetic immune defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>The intestinal microbiota is acquired at birth but changes rapidly during the first year of life. In adults, each person's unique population of fecal microbiota is fairly stable over time, but fluctuations occur in response to environmental and developmental factors and in disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. Yet another important measure beyond the composition of intestinal microbiota is the manner in which intestinal microbiota modulate microbial functions such as energy metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">136,137</a>]. Studies in mice have shown that intestinal microbiota and the ability of the host to recognize and respond to these microbiota are important in the generation and optimal function of intestinal antimicrobial proteins, epithelial cells, innate lymphoid cells, natural killer T cells, macrophages, interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells, intestinal and peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/33,138-154\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,138-154</a>].</p><p>At the same time, the host immune system and various host conditions (eg, obesity) can influence intestinal microbial communities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/44,155-159\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,155-159</a>]. The microbial community alterations can, in turn, modulate intestinal inflammatory outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/58,156,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,156,157</a>]. Environmental factors can also influence intestinal microbiota, including dietary factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/160,161\" class=\"abstract_t\">160,161</a>], helminth exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>], and antibiotic usage. Changes in these environmental factors have likely contributed to the increased prevalence of IBD during the past century. For example, the increased use of antibiotics in early childhood has been associated with an increased likelihood of developing IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/163,164\" class=\"abstract_t\">163,164</a>].

These alterations in microbial communities have been identified even at the time of initial diagnosis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>]. Whether these microbial alterations are primary drivers of IBD or secondary to the underlying intestinal inflammation observed with IBD is not yet clear. No single agent has been shown to have a consistent relationship to IBD. The prevailing hypothesis at this time is that changes in communities of intestinal bacteria can contribute to the initiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuation of inflammation associated with IBD.</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation of immune responses directed against particular microbial components. For example, antibodies to the DNA segment (I2) in affected mucosa is observed in 54 percent of patients with Crohn disease compared with 4 to 10 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>], and antibodies to bacterial flagellin are observed in complicated Crohn disease patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/172,173\" class=\"abstract_t\">172,173</a>]. In general, the immunoreactivity to microbial antigens correlates to more aggressive IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/174,175\" class=\"abstract_t\">174,175</a>]. It has been unclear if these increased antibodies are in response to the enhanced exposure to intestinal bacteria due to epithelial barrier perturbations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to increased immune reactivity of intestinal immune cells in the context of inflammation, or if these antibodies also contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.</p><p>The role of microbiota is also being examined in patients who have undergone an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery for ulcerative colitis.

As an example, various rodent models of colitis develop intestinal inflammation in the presence of a normal microflora, but not in germ-free conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/174,179,180\" class=\"abstract_t\">174,179,180</a>]. In some cases, bacteria from mice with colitis have been shown to promote intestinal inflammation when transferred from one animal to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/156,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,157</a>]. In other cases, select bacteria result in inflammation specifically when combined with an underlying genetic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. Moreover, certain combinations of bacteria (eg, probiotics) can mediate protection from inflammation through such mechanisms as modulation of growth factors that promote epithelial restitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>]. Beyond their ability to regulate colitis, studies in mice have shown that intestinal microbiota can modulate the development of other diseases such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/183-185\" class=\"abstract_t\">183-185</a>].</p><p>Additional analyses have revealed that specific microbial components, such as the polysaccharide A component of the resident intestinal microbe <em>Bacterioides fragilis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/186\" class=\"abstract_t\">186</a>], and microbial-derived products, such as short-chain fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/187,188\" class=\"abstract_t\">187,188</a>], are mechanisms through which intestinal microbiota can modulate both intestinal immune system development and intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/189,190\" class=\"abstract_t\">189,190</a>].</p><p>The nature of the microbial alterations in IBD have extended to those beyond bacteria.

Further supporting contributions from intestinal viral communities are studies that have shown that, in mice with alterations in genes associated with IBD, colonization with norovirus leads to intestinal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/192\" class=\"abstract_t\">192</a>]. Fungi have also been shown to modulate intestinal inflammation in mouse studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/193\" class=\"abstract_t\">193</a>], and studies are ongoing to determine how fungi may be altered in human IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/194\" class=\"abstract_t\">194</a>].</p><p>Genetic studies have identified susceptibility loci that regulate innate responses to the microbial flora.

In fact, approximately 70 percent of the genes are shared between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, thereby highlighting significant genetic overlap in these disease entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Many of the variants are located in intronic regions of the gene, such that they do not alter the amino acids within the proteins encoded by these genes, but rather likely modulate the expression of the proteins. This expression modulation is generally mild in degree, consistent with the fact that each of the susceptibility loci confers a slight increase in disease risk. A subset of the pathways associated with IBD susceptibility also contribute to very early-onset IBD when associated with genetic variants that result in more dramatic disruption of the same pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/196\" class=\"abstract_t\">196</a>].

Studies are ongoing to define the specific genes within the identified susceptibility loci, the functional consequences of the variants within these genes, and the specific manner in which the associations are contributing to IBD pathogenesis. The following are illustrative of the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Innate immune pathways</strong> &ndash; The first susceptibility gene identified in association with Crohn disease encodes for the protein NOD2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/197,198\" class=\"abstract_t\">197,198</a>]. Of the genes identified to date, NOD2 confers the greatest risk of developing Crohn disease. The wild-type NOD2 protein responds to bacterial peptidoglycan, which then activates signaling pathways that lead to cytokine production and clearance of bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/199\" class=\"abstract_t\">199</a>]. The variants associated with Crohn disease result in a loss of these various functional outcomes. Mice deficient in NOD2 are susceptible to enteric pathogens and have changes in their intestinal luminal bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/200,201\" class=\"abstract_t\">200,201</a>]. NOD2 is expressed in a variety of cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and stromal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/199\" class=\"abstract_t\">199</a>], thereby highlighting the many different levels at which NOD2 contributes to intestinal immune function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An individual inheriting one mutant <em>NOD2</em> allele has a 1.5- to 3.7-fold increase in risk of developing Crohn disease, while an individual inheriting two mutant <em>NOD2</em> alleles has a 17- to 40-fold increase in risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/202-205\" class=\"abstract_t\">202-205</a>]. Penetrance of Crohn disease in carriers of one mutant <em>NOD2</em> allele is 0.54 percent and two mutant <em>NOD2</em> alleles is 4.9 percent, compared with 0.18 percent for wild-type <em>NOD2</em> carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/205\" class=\"abstract_t\">205</a>]. In contrast to the risk conferred to European-ancestry populations, studies in various Asian-ancestry populations have not found association between the common <em>NOD2</em> variants and Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/134,206,207\" class=\"abstract_t\">134,206,207</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The variants in <em>NOD2</em> confer susceptibility to developing Crohn disease at an earlier age, to ileal and fibrostenosing Crohn disease, and to worse outcomes following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/202,203,208-212\" class=\"abstract_t\">202,203,208-212</a>]. A meta-analysis that included 49 studies with 8893 Crohn disease patients found that patients with <em>NOD2</em> mutations were at increased risk for complicated disease (relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.10-1.24) and surgery (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.38-1.80) compared with those without mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/213\" class=\"abstract_t\">213</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to <em>NOD2</em>, a number of other IBD-associated gene variants have been shown to modulate innate pathways. Interestingly, innate cells from healthy individuals demonstrate dramatic variation in responses upon exposure to microbial products. This variation between individuals is in part genetically determined and contributes to the balance in susceptibility to infectious diseases and to immune-mediated diseases. Various studies have examined innate cells from individuals carrying IBD risk variants. In some cases, the variants that confer IBD risk have been shown to increase innate pathway responses (eg, <em>IRF5</em>, <em>TNFSF15</em>, <em>TPL2</em>), thereby increasing cytokine production in the presence of microbial products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/127,214,215\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,214,215</a>].

These proteins are involved in promoting autophagy, a process that mediates resistance to intracellular pathogens. Consequences of the mutation in <em>ATG16L1</em> associated with Crohn disease include changes in Paneth cells and goblet cells, a decreased ability to clear bacteria, and an increased secretion of cytokines in studies in both mice and IBD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/60,61,224,225\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61,224,225</a>].

By contrast, an uncommon coding variant appears to confer an approximately two- to threefold <strong>protection</strong> against the risk of IBD. As noted above, IL-23 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is important for the generation of Th17 cells. Individuals carrying the protective <em>IL23R</em> risk variant have less circulating Th17 cells, and their T cells signal less in response to IL-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/231-233\" class=\"abstract_t\">231-233</a>]. Interestingly, loci containing <em>STAT3</em>, <em>JAK2,</em> and <em>TYK2</em> (signaling molecules downstream of IL-23-dependent signaling); <em>IL12B</em> (the p40 subunit that is contained within both IL-12 and IL-23); and <em>RORC</em> (a transcription factor associated with Th17 cells) are associated with IBD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/129-131,219\" class=\"abstract_t\">129-131,219</a>], thereby highlighting the convergence of multiple genes in the same pathway.

The IBD risk variants lead to decreased expression of IL18RAP, IL18R1, and IL1R1 on innate cells.

As a result, a number of the IBD gene variants that regulate innate immune responses will likely also modulate adaptive immune responses through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Examples of IBD risk variants that directly regulate adaptive immune pathways include <em>PTPN2</em> and <em>PTPN22</em>. Crohn disease patients who carry the IBD risk <em>PTPN2</em> variants show increased Th1 and Th17 cell, but decreased Treg markers in serum and intestinal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/244\" class=\"abstract_t\">244</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epithelial pathways &ndash;</strong> Several susceptibility loci include genes that regulate epithelial cell functions.
