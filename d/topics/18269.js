A major depressive episode is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide. Additional information about the clinical presentation and diagnosis of major depressive disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2080251\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuation and maintenance treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuation treatment and maintenance treatment are distinguished from each other, as are remission and recovery, and relapse and recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Continuation treatment is administered after resolution of a major depressive episode to preserve and enhance remission, and prevent relapse of the presenting episode. Remission represents a period of time with minimal or no symptoms; the duration of this time period varies among different studies (eg, two to eight consecutive months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Continuation treatment is followed by maintenance treatment, which is provided after recovery from the presenting episode to prevent recurrence of new, subsequent episodes. Recovery is said to occur when patients remain well for a period of time exceeding the interval used to define remission. </p><p>However, there is no established cutoff that separates the end of remission from the beginning of recovery; thus, the distinction between continuation and maintenance treatment is not standardized. Many studies therefore use the terms &quot;continuation treatment&quot; and &quot;maintenance treatment&quot; interchangeably to describe treatment that is provided after patients respond to acute therapy. Likewise, &quot;relapse&quot; and &quot;recurrence&quot; are often used interchangeably because distinguishing relapse of the presenting episode from recurrence of a new episode is arbitrary. Continuation treatment has been studied more frequently than maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and systematic reviews of &quot;maintenance treatment&quot; typically include both continuation and maintenance trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Additional information about recovery from and recurrence of major depressive episodes is discussed separately.

The efficacy of CBT is described elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H8038740\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with unipolar major depression who respond to acute treatment with behavioral activation and are not at increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">relapse/recurrence</span> may also reasonably decline continuation treatment, provided the presenting episode was neither chronic nor severe. Behavioral activation focuses on increasing rewarding activities, promoting behaviors that decrease rumination, and improving problem solving skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. A one year randomized trial found that relapse of major depression was comparable for patients who remitted with acute phase behavioral activation and received no further treatment (N = 27) and for patients who remitted with and continued <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> (maximum dose 50 mg per day; N = 28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Patients who recover from their first lifetime episode of unipolar major depression with acute and continuation pharmacotherapy may reasonably decline maintenance treatment, provided that the presenting episode was neither chronic nor severe, that remission was stable rather than marked by subsyndromal symptoms, that symptoms did not emerge during discontinuation of treatment, and that patients are not at increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">relapse/recurrence</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/1,2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,25</a>]. Support for this approach includes findings from a nationally representative survey in the United States that identified individuals with no lifetime history of major depression (N = 27,609) and individuals with a lifetime history of one uncomplicated major depressive episode (which did not include suicidal ideation, psychotic features, psychomotor retardation, or severe impairment, and remitted within six months; N = 418) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The same treatment that was successfully used acutely is typically selected for <span class=\"nowrap\">continuation/maintenance</span> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/1,2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,31</a>]. Pharmacotherapy alone has been most widely studied and used for acute treatment and thus continuation and maintenance treatment as well because of convenience and availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/1,2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,32</a>]. Other factors to consider in choosing maintenance treatment include the patient's past response as well as that of family members, patient preference, and cost. The efficacy of standard <span class=\"nowrap\">continuation/maintenance</span> treatments is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H8038540\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Continuation/maintenance</span> pharmacotherapy for unipolar major depression nearly always includes antidepressant medications, which should be used at the same dose that achieves remission (see <a href=\"#H8038660\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/1,2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,31</a>]. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics have been most widely studied, other reasonable options include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonin modulators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vilazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vilazodone</a>), atypical antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/12,13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,33</a>].

Patients may want to discontinue the acute phase antidepressant and switch to a different drug for <span class=\"nowrap\">continuation/maintenance</span> treatment; indications for switching include adverse effects, specific residual depressive symptoms (eg, insomnia may respond to sedating medications), comorbid general medical conditions, and drug-drug interactions. Switching antidepressants is discussed separately.

However, there are no high quality <span class=\"nowrap\">continuation/maintenance</span> studies of medication combinations. Augmentation of antidepressants is discussed separately.

However, the efficacy of maintenance phase pharmacotherapy may possibly exceed that of maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8038653\" class=\"local\">'Interpersonal psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The most widely studied psychotherapy for continuation and maintenance treatment of unipolar major depression is CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other reasonable choices include interpersonal psychotherapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. No head-to-head randomized trials have compared different psychotherapies; thus, the choice frequently depends upon availability and patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H8038682\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Randomized trials indicate that continuation and maintenance treatment with pharmacotherapy plus interpersonal psychotherapy is superior to either pharmacotherapy alone or psychotherapy alone.

A major depressive episode is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following symptoms: dysphoria, anhedonia, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, anergia, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>).

Remission represents a period of time (eg, two to eight months) with minimal or no depressive symptoms. Continuation treatment is followed by maintenance treatment, which is used after recovery from the presenting episode to prevent recurrence of new depressive episodes. Recovery occurs when patients remain well for a period of time exceeding the interval used to define remission. However, it is not clear when remission ends and recovery begins, and thus the cutoff between continuation and maintenance treatment is not standardized.
