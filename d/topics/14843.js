It is an effective induction agent for most children undergoing RSI and is especially useful for patients with hypovolemic shock (eg, pediatric trauma patients), hypotensive patients with status epilepticus, and those with increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

Etomidate also has a protective effect similar to thiopental for generalized seizure activity, although regional neuro-excitation has been described in adults. Myoclonus has been reported as an adverse effect associated with etomidate. It does not generally interfere with intubation in children when paralytics are also used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-of-the-operating-room-in-children-medications-for-sedation-and-paralysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such myoclonus has been misidentified as seizure activity, leading to incorrect recommendations that etomidate be avoided in patients with seizure disorders. If neuro-excitation is a concern, then benzodiazepine sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>) may be provided after intubation.

In addition, ketamine causes endogenous catecholamine release, thus augmenting heart rate and blood pressure in patients who are <strong>not</strong> catecholamine depleted.

When given to patients in septic shock with exhausted endogenous catecholamine stores, it has rarely been associated with cardiac arrest that has been attributed to negative inotropic effect that is not overcome by release of endogenous catecholamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-of-the-operating-room-in-children-medications-for-sedation-and-paralysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

On the other hand, ketamine has anticonvulsant properties and may benefit patients with neurologic injury by increasing cerebral perfusion, particularly those who are hypotensive. Thus, it may still be appropriate for RSI in patients with increased ICP associated with low or normal blood pressure. However, we generally avoid it in patients who are hypertensive. The use of ketamine for patients with head injury is discussed in greater detail separately.

However, it frequently causes vomiting. Thus, in most patients with concern for an open globe, other sedatives are better choices.

Succinylcholine binds directly to the postsynaptic ACh receptors of the motor endplate, causing continuous stimulation of these receptors. This effect leads to transient fasciculations followed by muscular paralysis.
