Its genetic and biologic similarities to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) have prompted its classification in the beta herpesvirus subfamily (genus <em>Roseolovirus</em>, along with human herpesvirus 7 [HHV-7]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are two HHV-6 variants, HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Based on their distinctive biological properties and genome sequences, HHV-6A and HHV-6B are classified as two distinct herpesvirus species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. HHV-6A and HHV-6B also differ in epidemiology, growth properties, antigenic properties, and restriction endonuclease profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

HHV-6 can also be recovered in vivo from a broad range of tissues such as lymph nodes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), renal tubular cells, salivary glands, and the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. HHV-6 has also been identified in astrocytes from gliomas, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>During acute HHV-6 infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> harbor more replication-competent HHV-6 than CD4+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Hematopoietic differentiation can also lead to HHV-6 reactivation from infected peripheral blood progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CD46, an immunomodulatory protein that is also called membrane cofactor protein, is a cellular receptor for HHV-6A and HHV-6B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 can cause a confusing clinical picture in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Because patients with inherited HHV-6 have at least one copy of the viral genome in each cell of their body, they have unusually high levels of HHV-6 DNA in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues. This is discussed in greater detail separately.

Once HHV-6 enters a permissive host cell, viral replication occurs relatively slowly. Within 24 hours after infection, the rate of cellular protein synthesis is high; by 65 hours after infection, host cell DNA synthesis is shut off and viral DNA synthesis is underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Cytopathic effects can be seen within three to five days after infection.

HHV-6 can be transmitted from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to stimulated CD4+ T cells in vitro. Thus, dendritic cells may be the first cell population targeted by HHV-6, and they could play an important role in the virus' transmission to T cells, which leads to further virus propagation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>HHV-6 can induce expression of a superantigen, which may lead to further dysregulation of the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. On the other hand, HHV-6 increases the activity of natural killer (NK) cells via activation of IL-15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Its genetic and biologic similarities to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) have prompted its classification in the beta herpesvirus subfamily (genus <em>Roseolovirus</em>, along with human herpesvirus 7 [HHV-7]). As with other herpes viruses, mature HHV-6 virions are double-stranded DNA viruses, approximately 200 nm in diameter and are composed of four main structural elements: an electron-dense core, a capsid with icosahedral symmetry, a tegument, and an outer envelope. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two HHV-6 species, HHV-6A and HHV-6B, differ in epidemiology, growth properties, nucleotide sequences, antigenic properties, and restriction endonuclease profiles. (See <a href=\"#H1226420058\" class=\"local\">'Taxonomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-6 replicates most efficiently in vitro in activated primary T cells as well as in continuous T cell lines. However, the virus can also replicate with varying efficiency in a wide array of host cell types including <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages,</span> natural killer cells, astrocytes, megakaryocytes, and glial cell lineages. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cell tropism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD46, an immunomodulatory protein that is also called membrane cofactor protein, is a cellular receptor for HHV-6A and HHV-6B. HHV-6 integrates into the human genome; seven different chromosomal sites of integration have been identified. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Viral replication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD4+ T cells constitute the major population of cells permissive to HHV-6 replication even though HHV-6 does not bind directly to the CD4 molecule. Once HHV-6 enters a permissive host cell, viral replication occurs relatively slowly. Within 24 hours after infection, the rate of cellular protein synthesis is high; by 65 hours after infection, host cell DNA synthesis is shut off and viral DNA synthesis is underway. Cytopathic effects can be seen within three to five days after infection. The net effect is a significant impairment in immune function. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Effect on the immune system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-6 replication genes encode a number of viral proteins including U38, a viral DNA polymerase; U27, a polymerase <span class=\"nowrap\">accessory/processivity</span> protein; U41, a single-stranded DNA binding protein; and U43, U74, U77, which are three helicase-primase proteins. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Viral genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-6 seroprevalence rates vary from 20 percent among pregnant women in Morocco to 100 percent among asymptomatic Chinese adults. In industrialized nations such as the United States and Japan, rates of seroprevalence range from 72 to 95 percent. HHV-6 is frequently acquired by an early age. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of isolates from otherwise healthy children or adults are HHV-6B. In contrast, both HHV-6A and -6B have been recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients who are immunocompromised or chronically ill. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Distribution of HHV-6A and HHV-6B'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are few data regarding the incubation period of HHV-6 infection, it is thought to be approximately 9 days (range 5 to 15 days). The most common route of HHV-6 transmission appears to be transfer via saliva from mother to infant. Perinatal transmission is also possible. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period and transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Salahuddin SZ, Ablashi DV, Markham PD, et al.
