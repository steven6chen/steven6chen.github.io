In contrast, if the other beta globin allele carries the sickle mutation or another mutation (eg, for beta thalassemia), the individual will have a sickle cell disease (eg, sickle cell anemia, sickle-beta thalassemia).</p><p>The gene for the sickle hemoglobin mutation is distributed throughout the world, with especially high frequency in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean countries (especially Greece), the Middle East, and parts of India. This high prevalence in certain regions of the world appears to reflect the protective effect of the sickle hemoglobin mutation against severe falciparum malaria.

This testing will detect both sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait. All states in the United States have been mandated to offer testing since 2006, and the proportion of parents opting out of screening is extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p>However, the reporting of the results to families and providers is highly variable, and many parents of children with sickle cell trait are unaware of their newborn screening results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 100 mothers who were contacted regarding a positive result for sickle cell trait from newborn screening, fewer than half knew their sickle cell status prior to conception; only 34 of 60 (57 percent) with sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait had received professional hemoglobinopathy counseling; and only 23 of 100 (23 percent) reported prenatal discussions about newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most strikingly, 41 parents of a child with sickle cell trait (41 percent) first learned this result from the study recruiter rather than their pediatrician, birth hospital, or state Department of Public Health.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 282 individuals in various neighborhoods in the United States, only 45 (16 percent) knew their sickle cell trait status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of United States clinicians and families, only 37 percent of families were notified of sickle cell trait status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 15 primary care pediatrics practices in the United States, 28 percent of primary care physicians did not actively seek the results of newborn screening, even though the information was generally accessible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p>Importantly, communication of a screening result consistent with sickle cell trait should always be accompanied by appropriate counseling about the implications for the individual and family members. (See <a href=\"#H2126218\" class=\"local\">'Information/counseling to be provided with results'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2126053\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescents and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite routine newborn screening, some individuals may not be screened at birth (eg, immigrants from countries without routine screening), and many others may be unsure of their screening results due to variability in reporting. Any individual who does not have definitive information regarding their sickle status and might benefit from this information (eg, individuals planning a pregnancy, individuals planning intensive exertion at high altitudes) should be offered screening. Ethnicity cannot be used as a routine criterion to eliminate the possibility of sickle cell trait. Screening should be planned, elective, and linked to meaningful counseling, which should include appropriate and accurate information regarding the implications of a positive result. Screening of asymptomatic individuals who are unaware of their status is generally deferred until late <span class=\"nowrap\">adolescence/early</span> adulthood because this is optimal for obtaining informed consent and providing counseling regarding the implications of a positive result. (See <a href=\"#H2126218\" class=\"local\">'Information/counseling to be provided with results'</a> below.)</p><p>Information about sickle cell trait status in asymptomatic individuals is most important for preconception counseling. Some individuals may also benefit from this information in other settings (eg, prior to strenuous athletic participation). These benefits are weighed against potential harms, including risks related to loss of insurance, employment, athletic participation, and other forms of discrimination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Practical issues'</a>.)</p><p>We generally offer screening in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preconception counseling</strong> &ndash; Prenatal counseling and screening for sickle cell trait should be offered for all pregnancies. Targeted counseling and screening policies are often ineffective and problematic. Reliable data concerning carrier risk for various ethnic and geographic communities are often not available and are needed for informed decisions and re-examination of the use of ethnicity in prenatal carrier testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and testing for hemoglobinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Athletic <span class=\"nowrap\">pursuits/physical</span> training</strong> &ndash; We favor voluntary rather than mandatory screening for sickle cell trait for individuals pursuing intense physical training (eg, competitive athletes), with decisions based on the potential benefits and risks of screening for the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This is consistent with the approach of many professional societies that favor voluntary screening for selected individuals rather than mandatory screening. A universal preventative measure for all athletes, without mandatory screening, is recommended by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA), the American Public Health Association (APHA), the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), the American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and the American Society of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology (ASPHO). (See <a href=\"#H15785377\" class=\"local\">'Intensive exercise/physical training'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are ongoing discussions by different professional groups regarding routine screening of athletes for sickle cell trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In the United States, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires mandatory testing (or confirmation from newborn screening) for sickle cell trait, with a written opt-out provision, for all student athletes participating in Division I and II (ie, college level) sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This policy is highly controversial. Each branch of the US military has its own policies on screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The US Army has abolished universal screening in favor of universal precautions; the US Marine Corps continues to test all recruits.</p><p/><p>There are no prospective studies indicating that screening decreases adverse effects in individuals with sickle cell trait. Potential benefits of screening (or discussions about screening) include the opportunity to review and reinforce healthy practices for all individuals such as adequate hydration and avoidance of exertional heat illness or metabolic abnormalities during intensive physical activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83028 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Rhabdomyolysis and sudden death during strenuous physical activity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exertional-heat-illness-in-adolescents-and-adults-management-and-prevention#H12884585\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exertional heat illness in adolescents and adults: Management and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention of exertional heat illness'</a>.)</p><p>The potential benefits of screening must also be weighed against potential harms, including risks related to loss of insurance, employment, athletic participation, and other forms of discrimination. In addition to risks of discrimination, professional groups have raised concerns that mandatory screening without adequate counseling could lead to additional adverse effects. These benefits and harms of screening are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Strategies for prioritization and delivery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Genetic discrimination'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, communication of a positive screening result for sickle cell trait should always be accompanied by appropriate counseling that addresses misconceptions and conveys appropriate useful information. (See <a href=\"#H2126218\" class=\"local\">'Information/counseling to be provided with results'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24518771\"><span class=\"h2\">Appropriate laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sickle cell trait <strong>cannot</strong> be detected by measuring hemoglobin level, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, red blood cell indices such as mean cell volume (MCV), or review of the peripheral blood smear, as these measures are all normal in individuals with sickle cell trait.</p><p>Screening for sickle cell trait is done with isoelectric focusing (IEF), hemoglobin electrophoresis, or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;, section on 'Laboratory methods'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of sickle cell trait (rather than sickle cell disease) is established by the finding of both hemoglobin A (HbA) and hemoglobin S (HbS), with the amount of HbA greater than HbS (ie, the FAS pattern) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806 \">figure 1</a>). Typically, individuals with sickle cell trait have approximately 50 to 60 percent HbA and 35 to 45 percent HbS (may be lower with concomitant alpha thalassemia). The percent HbS increases with age and plateaus at approximately two years, due to switching from fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin synthesis; adult hemoglobin uses the hemoglobin beta chain that is affected by the sickle mutation, whereas fetal hemoglobin does not. The co-inheritance of other hemoglobinopathies such as alpha thalassemia or beta thalassemia may also affect the percent HbS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70184\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70184 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H1271747666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Overview and typical presentations'</a>.) </p><p>In some newborns and infants less than six months, it may not be possible to distinguish the FAS pattern (greater percentage of HbA than HbS, indicative of sickle cell trait) from the FSA pattern (greater percentage of HbS than HbA) indicative of a compound state such as sickle-beta thalassemia or hemoglobin SC disease. Repeat testing at age three to six months, or molecular testing (DNA analysis) is generally used to distinguish these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;, section on 'FAS and FSA patterns'</a>.)</p><p>Other screening tests are less helpful than IEF, electrophoresis, and HPLC, and are generally avoided. Examples include the sickle prep test (microscopic evaluation for sickled cells from blood treated with sodium metabisulfate), which is less reliable and should not be used. Sickle solubility testing has a lower sensitivity than electrophoresis or HPLC, and it is not used in infants under six months of age because HbS levels are lower in young infants; results from this testing should be confirmed using electrophoresis or HPLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2126218\"><span class=\"h2\">Information/counseling to be provided with results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implications of sickle cell trait status should be communicated by a clinician who understands them, as there is a high prevalence of misleading information communicated during genetic counseling sessions for sickle cell trait by clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-trait/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].

The athlete should lie down, vital signs should be checked, supplemental oxygen given by face mask, and the athlete cooled if necessary. Failing immediate improvement, emergency personnel should be alerted (in the United States, 911 should be called), an automated external defibrillator placed, and an intravenous line with normal saline started. The athlete should be moved to a hospital urgently, and the emergency department told to expect fulminant rhabdomyolysis and its grave metabolic complications.

The frequency is higher in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean countries (especially Greece), the Middle East, and parts of India. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many parts of the world, newborns are routinely screened for sickle cell trait; however, reporting of results to the family is highly variable. Screening of asymptomatic individuals who are unaware of their status is generally deferred until late <span class=\"nowrap\">adolescence/early</span> adulthood. We generally offer screening to appropriate individuals as part of preconception counseling and prior to athletic participation. (See <a href=\"#H2125959\" class=\"local\">'Newborn screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2126053\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents and adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for sickle cell trait is done with hemoglobin electrophoresis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806 \">figure 1</a>) or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sickle cell trait is established by the presence of both hemoglobin A (HbA) and hemoglobin S (HbS), with the amount of HbA greater than HbS (ie, the FAS pattern) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210 \">table 3</a>). The sickle prep test and sickle solubility test are generally avoided. Unlike sickle cell disease, individuals with sickle cell trait have a normal hemoglobin level, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, red blood cell indices, and peripheral blood smear. (See <a href=\"#H24518771\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication of a screening result consistent with sickle cell trait should always be accompanied by appropriate counseling about the implications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96752 \">table 4</a>), provided by an individual with adequate training and understanding of the information. (See <a href=\"#H2126218\" class=\"local\">'Information/counseling to be provided with results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with sickle cell trait do not have an increased mortality rate compared with the general population. However, a number of potential complications may occur, including hematuria, renal medullary carcinoma (extremely rare), splenic infarction at high altitude, complications of traumatic hyphema, and sudden death with prolonged exercise or physical training. We generally offer testing in appropriate individuals who present with these findings, and in some cases management differs if sickle cell trait is identified. Sickle cell trait can lead to lower values for glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb-A1C), which may have implications for diabetes testing and monitoring. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure are no different from controls without sickle cell trait. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H793173465\" class=\"local\">'No increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, or heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, individuals with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. However, counseling should be offered by a qualified individual regarding the risk of having a child with sickle cell disease. Individuals with sickle cell trait should receive unrestricted access to birth control, and be informed of a possible increased risk of thrombosis with hormonal birth control methods. Individuals with sickle cell trait who are planning to become pregnant or already pregnant should obtain testing for the other parent to allow determination of the likelihood of having a child with sickle cell disease. Pregnancy is well-tolerated in individuals with sickle cell trait, and sickle cell trait does not appear to be a risk factor for large or small for gestational age infants. (See <a href=\"#H30106265\" class=\"local\">'Reproductive issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with sickle cell trait can donate blood or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and can received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor for stem cell mobilization. Blood from a donor with sickle cell trait generally is not transfused to an individual with sickle cell disease because it will be more difficult to reach the appropriate target hemoglobin S percentage. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Blood and stem cell donation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are ongoing discussions regarding routine screening of athletes for sickle cell trait. Anticipatory interventions to prevent dehydration and hyperthermia during intensive physical training need to be enforced and expanded for all athletes. If any athlete with sickle cell trait begins to struggle in a drill, the drill should be stopped and medical attention should be prompt. Failing immediate improvement, emergency personnel should be alerted; an automated external defibrillator placed; an intravenous line with normal saline started; and the athlete moved to a hospital that is prepared to treat fulminant rhabdomyolysis.
