The usual, nonrapid sequence of induction and intubation for anesthesia consists of administration of an induction agent, proof of the ability to mask ventilate, administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA), and endotracheal intubation once paralysis is achieved, usually approximately three minutes after induction. Since induction of anesthesia results in loss of airway protective reflexes, pulmonary aspiration is a risk during the interval between loss of consciousness and inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tube.</p><p>The components of RSII are designed to protect the airway with a cuffed endotracheal tube as quickly as possible after induction, while reducing the chance of passive or active regurgitation. An essential goal of RSII is the achievement of adequate depth of anesthesia, and, most often, paralysis, for laryngoscopy, to prevent coughing, straining, and active vomiting with airway manipulation.</p><p>While RSII is a departure from the usual practice of induction of anesthesia, the equivalent method of rapid airway control, often called &quot;rapid sequence intubation&quot; (RSI), is the most commonly used method of controlling the airway in the emergency room.</p><p>This topic will discuss the components, techniques, and medications used for RSII for anesthesia. Preoperative fasting guidelines, airway management for induction of anesthesia, rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department, and medications used for induction of anesthesia are discussed more fully separately.

PPIs are more effective at reducing gastric volume and pH if given in two doses, one the evening prior to surgery, and another on the morning of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A single dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> three hours prior to induction of anesthesia has been shown to significantly reduce gastric volume and increase pH of stomach contents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73917\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION FOR ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the preparation for routine induction of anesthesia, an assistant should be present who understands RSII and is capable of correctly applying cricoid pressure to assist in airway management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73938\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway evaluation is an important step in making the decision to perform an RSII. If a difficult airway is predicted, the risk of aspiration must be weighed against the risk of difficult or failed airway management. This is because RSII usually includes the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) without proof that mask ventilation will be possible once the patient is paralyzed. In all but the most emergent situations, a quick airway examination and query about previous airway problems should be possible. If difficult airway management is expected, a modified RSII, awake intubation, or even an inhalation induction may be chosen as alternatives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a> and <a href=\"#H1078269121\" class=\"local\">'Potential complications of RSII'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73932\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation of equipment for RSII should be similar to that for routine induction. An assortment of standard and alternative airway devices should be immediately available, including small, medium, and large facemasks; several sizes and types of laryngoscopes; oral and nasal airways; several sizes of supraglottic airway, and a bougie. Alternative devices for laryngoscopy, including a video laryngoscope and flexible intubating scope, as well as other emergency airway equipment, should be accessible quickly and present in the operating room or anesthetizing location if difficult airway is suspected. Working suction must always be close by during induction of anesthesia; for RSII, we usually place the suction directly under the headrest for immediate access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61805\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication may be administered prior to RSII to relieve anxiety, to blunt or eliminate the physiologic response to airway management, and to reduce the volume or increase the pH of stomach contents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anxiolytics </strong>&ndash; For patients who are hemodynamically stable, a benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> up to 1 to 2 mg IV) may be administered to reduce anxiety. This dose should be titrated cautiously in older adults and when given simultaneously with narcotic premedication, to avoid hypotension and loss of protective airway reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> and airway manipulation can trigger a vagal response, especially in children and neonates. We therefore suggest the use of atropine with RSII for all children younger than one year and for children less than five years of age who receive succinylcholine, though succinylcholine is rarely administered to children in the operating room. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A vagal response to straightforward endotracheal intubation is much less common in adults; as such, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> is not routinely administered as a premedication before RSII for adults. However, anticholinergic treatment may be required if bradycardia occurs with difficult laryngoscopy and intubation, or as a result of intubation in patients with preexisting bradycardia caused by medication or conduction system disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opioids </strong>&ndash; Opioids may be administered as part of premedication for analgesia and sedation. They should be titrated to avoid respiratory depression and loss of protective airway reflexes in patients at risk for aspiration, especially in older patients, and when administered with benzodiazepines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antacids </strong>&ndash; We suggest premedication with antacids prior to induction of anesthesia for patients at high risk of aspiration to increase the pH of gastric contents so that, if aspiration does occur, it will result in less pulmonary damage. Several classes of antacid medication are routinely used:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clear, nonparticulate oral antacid (eg, citric <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/sodium</span> citrate, 30 mL orally immediately prior to induction) increases pH of stomach contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a> 20 mg IV, given 40 to 60 minutes prior to induction) reduces the volume and increases the pH of stomach contents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For pregnant patients and for those at high risk of aspiration, we routinely administer clear, nonparticulate antacid prior to induction. For nonpregnant patients at high risk of aspiration who have not received a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2RA on the morning of surgery, we also administer an H2RA 40 to 60 minutes prior to induction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prokinetic agent </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> increases lower esophageal sphincter tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], induces peristalsis, and enhances stomach emptying, thereby reducing gastric volume and the risk of regurgitation. Metoclopramide is particularly useful in patients with gastroparesis undergoing general anesthesia. It is also antiemetic and may help prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Rare adverse effects of metoclopramide include extrapyramidal effects and tardive dyskinesia, which are more common if administered quickly. We reserve metoclopramide for patients with uncontrolled reflux and pregnant patients who are symptomatic with reflux. In this setting, we administer metoclopramide 10 mg IV over one to two minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73981\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's head should be positioned in the sniffing position to facilitate intubation (atlanto-occipital extension with head elevation of 3 to 7 cm). Obese patients may require a ramped position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95285 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H10737471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Patient positioning'</a>.)</p><p>When RSII is planned, we prefer to position the operating table with the head up because passive regurgitation and aspiration may be less likely if the larynx is above the level of the lower esophageal sphincter. We flex the hips to elevate the back of the operating table, or tilt the table 20 degrees head up, making sure that once that is done, the height of the patient's head is optimal for intubation. Should the patient regurgitate prior to or during induction, the table should be quickly tipped head down, the patient's head turned to the side, and the mouth suctioned to avoid aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74006\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients presenting for general anesthesia should be preoxygenated with 100 percent oxygen to increase oxygen reserve and provide additional time to secure the airway. This is particularly important prior to RSII, since with this technique, mask ventilation is not usually performed between induction and intubation. Preoxygenation is administered for three minutes of normal tidal volume breathing, for eight deep breaths over one minute, or until the fraction of expired oxygen is over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H62623\" class=\"local\">'Mask ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of nasal cannula for passive apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy can prolong the time to desaturation in high-risk patients during airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. We suggest the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula at 10 L in addition to facemask oxygen for those patients who are at high risk for rapid oxygen desaturation during the apneic period between induction and intubation, and for those at higher risk of difficult intubation.</p><p>A number of studies have shown either more rapid or effective preoxygenation or increased time to desaturation after apnea with the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during preoxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. CPAP can be provided using a tight-fitting anesthesia face mask, and pressure support ventilation provided with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Morbidly obese patients in particular may benefit from CPAP preoxygenation. Low levels of inspiratory pressure should be used to avoid gastric insufflation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74035\"><span class=\"h1\">CRICOID PRESSURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64654706\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although controversial, we routinely apply cricoid pressure (also known as Sellick's maneuver) prior to and during RSII until confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement. Despite conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of cricoid pressure for preventing regurgitation, clinical experience suggests that, in most situations, it is not harmful and may be beneficial.</p><p>The most significant downside to the use of cricoid pressure is the possibility that it may make laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway placement, or mask ventilation more difficult. We routinely have an assistant apply cricoid pressure during RSII, but we communicate the need to shift or release the pressure as necessary to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Cricoid pressure may have to be released if intubation proves difficult <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mask ventilation, supraglottic airway placement, or flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy become necessary. Should active vomiting occur, cricoid pressure should be released to avoid esophageal rupture. &#160;</p><p>We do not routinely use cricoid pressure during RSII for patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury because it can move unstable cervical spine fractures. In trauma patients with possible but unevaluated cervical spine injury, cricoid pressure should only be used along with manual in line stabilization to stabilize the posterior cervical spine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury#H1842206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Airway management strategy'</a>.)</p><p>As originally described by Sellick in 1961, the cricoid cartilage ring is pressed backward by an assistant against the underlying cervical vertebrae, occluding the lumen of the esophagus to prevent regurgitation of stomach contents into the pharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71800\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71800 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Based on cadaver and patient studies, pressure should be applied at 10 Newtons (approximately 2.5 lbs) while the patient is awake and increased to 30 Newtons after loss of consciousness. Despite these recommendations, clinicians and assistants are not routinely trained to standardize application of pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>The need for, efficacy, anatomical basis, and optimal technique for application of cricoid pressure have all been questioned in the literature. Evidence that cricoid pressure reduces the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents is scant and consists primarily of observational clinical studies and experimental data from cadaver studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Support for the efficacy of cricoid pressure at preventing regurgitation comes from a number of observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cadaver studies have shown that cricoid pressure prevents reflux of saline into the pharynx at esophageal pressures up to 50 cmH<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/17,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies have shown that cricoid pressure prevents gastric insufflation during mask ventilation in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study performed in patients undergoing elective surgery reported that cricoid pressure applied at 30 Newtons was effective at occluding the upper esophagus, as determined by the inability to pass gastric tubes of two different sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are case reports of regurgitation when cricoid pressure was released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28</a>].</p><p/><p>The anatomical basis for the use of cricoid pressure has been questioned by imaging studies. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that the esophagus is located lateral to the midline in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The application of cricoid pressure displaced the esophagus laterally in 90 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], suggesting that the esophagus would not be occluded by pressing the cartilage against cervical vertebrae. In contrast, an MRI study showed that application of 2 to 4 kg of cricoid pressure moved the cricoid cartilage and the hypopharynx as one unit, effectively obliterating the lumen of the alimentary tract, even with lateral displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Cricoid pressure at 20 Newtons has been shown to reduce lower esophageal pressure in awake, unanesthetized volunteers (presumably by reflex), with restoration to baseline after release of pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. If applicable to anesthetized patients, this effect could theoretically increase the chance of gastroesophageal reflux, though it isn't clear whether this would increase the chance of reflux into the pharynx. Another study of awake volunteers reported that application of cricoid pressure did not promote gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>While optimal external laryngeal manipulation (OELM) of the thyroid cartilage is often used to improve the view of the vocal cords during laryngoscopy, cricoid pressure should not be applied to improve laryngeal view. A number of studies have suggested that cricoid pressure may obstruct the view of the vocal cords, making intubation more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Cricoid pressure may also make mask ventilation and supraglottic airway placement more challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and may make fiberoptic intubation impossible. When either situation occurs, cricoid pressure may have to be released.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64653824\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasogastric tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with bowel obstruction, ileus, and other gastrointestinal pathology, some clinicians place a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach prior to induction of anesthesia. Nasogastric drainage or suction does not guarantee an empty stomach and may not remove particulate matter. Such patients often present for anesthesia and surgery with a nasogastric tube already in place. We generally leave the nasogastric tube in place during RSII, connect it to suction to drain the stomach prior to induction, and then leave it open to air as a vent for the stomach.

This timing can result in either underdosing, with the possibility of awareness or an undesirable sympathetic response to intubation, or to overdosing, with the possibility of hypotension. An alternative method of administration is to titrate the induction medication to loss of consciousness, recognizing that total induction time may be slightly longer with a titration technique.

Without the application of cricoid pressure, bag-mask ventilation with inflation pressure over 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O can result in inflation and, potentially, distention of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, a number of studies have shown that cricoid pressure prevents gastric insufflation during mask ventilation in children and adults without airway obstruction and, in adults, with airway pressures up to 60 cmH<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Patients without decreased oxygen reserve or increased oxygen consumption should not desaturate during RSII without mask ventilation. For patients expected to desaturate rapidly with apnea (eg, those with decreased functional residual capacity because of obesity or increased intraabdominal pressure; those with sepsis or fever), gentle, low-pressure mask ventilation with cricoid pressure is not likely to inflate or distend the stomach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H714699891\"><span class=\"h2\">Modified RSII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard definition of &quot;modified RSII,&quot; but most commonly it refers to the combination of cricoid pressure and mask ventilation during induction and intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The modification of RSII may be either the addition of mask ventilation to an otherwise traditional RSII, or the application of cricoid pressure to a routine induction and intubation. Common scenarios in which modified RSII may be chosen include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When airway evaluation suggests that intubation may be difficult for a patient who is at high risk of aspiration, gentle mask ventilation may be attempted prior to administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to prove that ventilation will be possible if intubation is difficult or prolonged. In this situation, one very low-pressure breath may be all that is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mask ventilation may be performed for patients who are likely to desaturate with apnea, despite preoxygenation. In this situation, several low-pressure breaths (&lt;20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) may be required while waiting for paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient who may be at unclear but potentially higher risk of regurgitation and aspiration, cricoid pressure may be applied during routine induction. Examples include patients with asymptomatic hiatal hernia, morbid obesity without symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and patients who have fasted appropriately but who are receiving opioids.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1078269109\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF LARYNGOSCOPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the goal of RSII is to intubate as rapidly as possible, the anesthesia clinician should use the laryngoscope and blade most likely to succeed on the first attempt. In most cases, this will be a standard laryngoscope used for direct laryngoscopy with a macintosh or miller blade. However, when a difficult airway is expected, a video laryngoscope may be a better choice, assuming the clinician is facile with its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a>.)</p><p>A number of trials have compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy with regard to first-attempt success at intubation and time to intubation, both particularly important for RSII, with variable results. Though studies consistently find a better glottic view with video laryngoscopes, a meta-analysis of trials comparing one type of video laryngoscope with direct laryngoscopy reported no difference in successful first-attempt intubation or time to intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In contrast, in another study, 200 patients with predicted difficult airways based on Mallampati classification grade 3 or 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 3</a>) were randomly assigned to intubation with a video laryngoscope versus direct laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Videolaryngoscopy resulted in a higher first-attempt intubation rate, decreased time to intubation, and a reduced number of optimizing maneuvers.</p><p>No matter which laryngoscope is chosen for RSII, a backup plan and the necessary equipment must be immediately available and at the bedside if difficult airway management is expected. All anesthesia clinicians should be familiar with a difficult airway algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94447\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94447 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H10737465\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Preparation for induction of anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>For RSII, we place a stylette in the endotracheal tube to add rigidity, to facilitate placement through the vocal cords, and to increase the chance of success on the first attempt at laryngoscopy. It is important to recognize that increasing the rigidity of the endotracheal tube can also potentially increase the risk of injury to the vocal cords or trachea. Once the tip of the tube is placed through the vocal cords, the stylette should be removed to avoid trauma to the anterior trachea and the tube advanced under direct vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1078269121\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS OF RSII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to perform RSII, to modify the induction sequence, or to perform a standard sequence induction must take into account the individualized potential risks of each choice. Potential complications of RSII include difficulty with intubation, hypoxia, hypotension, active regurgitation, and aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64653448\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult or failed airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficult intubation is always a possibility during induction of anesthesia. If the preoperative airway evaluation suggests potential difficulty with intubation, an awake or, if necessary, inhalation induction may be chosen instead of RSII. Difficult intubation is not always predictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Thus, equipment, personnel, and a backup plan for airway management must always be ready when RSII is performed. Anesthesia clinicians should be familiar with a difficult airway algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94447\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94447 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1078269128\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common risk of RSII is hypoxia, a potential result of oxygen desaturation during the period of apnea prior to intubation. Patients with poor oxygen reserves, such as obese patients, pregnant patients, and patients with pulmonary disease, may be at higher risk for arterial desaturation, despite preoxygenation. Low-pressure mask ventilation during RSII may prevent hypoxia and desaturation for such patients. (See <a href=\"#H714699891\" class=\"local\">'Modified RSII'</a> above.)</p><p>Passive apneic oxygenation using high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure preoxygenation are strategies that may increase the time to apneic oxygen desaturation during RSII. (See <a href=\"#H74006\" class=\"local\">'Preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1078269140\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension is common after RSII, especially for those patients who present for emergency surgery with hemodynamic instability. Dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest can also occur in critically ill patients with poor cardiovascular reserve. The selection of induction agent, rate of administration, and the dose administered should be based on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H1078269059\" class=\"local\">'Induction agents'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4228797384\"><span class=\"h2\">Regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regurgitation may occur during RSII, despite the maneuvers designed to prevent it. If the patient regurgitates, the head of the operating table should be quickly tipped down to allow material to drain away from the larynx. The head should be turned to the side and the oropharynx suctioned prior to intubation. The trachea should be suctioned prior to administration of a positive pressure breath. If active vomiting occurs, cricoid pressure should be released to avoid esophageal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64653784\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regurgitation and aspiration can occur during rapid sequence induction and intubation, even when protocols are followed as suggested. The incidence of aspiration during emergency surgical procedures is approximately 0.15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>The sequelae depend on the volume and type of material aspirated and the patient's comorbidities. Aspiration of small amounts of oral secretions may result in minor complications, such as cough or tracheal irritation, while aspiration of large-volume, particulate, or acidic material can result in infection, airway obstruction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Evaluation and management of aspiration pneumonia is discussed more fully separately.

In most cases, an orogastric tube should be passed during the anesthetic and suctioned and removed immediately prior to emergence. Patients should remain intubated with the endotracheal tube cuff inflated until responding to commands and until airway reflexes return. Patients should be transported to the recovery area with the head of the bed elevated to reduce the chance of reflux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1078269158\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) is routinely performed for patients at high risk of aspiration during the induction of general anesthesia. The risk of aspiration should be balanced against the risk of difficult intubation, hypoxia during apnea, and hypotension with RSII. (See <a href=\"#H211963066\" class=\"local\">'General indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An essential goal of RSII is the achievement of adequate depth of anesthesia and, most often, paralysis for laryngoscopy, to prevent coughing, straining, and active vomiting with airway manipulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are at high risk of aspiration, we suggest the administration of antacid medication before induction to increase the pH of gastric contents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For pregnant patients and for those at high risk of aspiration, we routinely administer clear, nonparticulate antacid prior to induction (eg, sodium citrate, 30 mL by mouth). For nonpregnant patients at high risk of aspiration who have not received a proton pump inhibitor or histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) on the morning of surgery, we also administer an H2RA 40 to 60 minutes prior to induction (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg IV).

Despite conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of cricoid pressure for preventing regurgitation, clinical experience suggests that, in most situations, it is not harmful and may be beneficial. We shift or release pressure if laryngoscopy proves difficult, and release cricoid pressure if active vomiting occurs. We avoid cricoid pressure in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury.
