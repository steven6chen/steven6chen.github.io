The median survival for metastatic breast cancer is 18 to 24 months, though this varies widely based on subtype of tumor, sites of metastatic involvement, and burden of metastatic disease, and some patients experience long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/1-4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,10</a>]. </p><p>No prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that systemic therapy prolongs survival compared with best supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer appears to have improved over time, a trend which has been attributed to the availability of new, more effective agents, including taxanes, aromatase inhibitors, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/1,2,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11-13</a>]. As an example, patients from the British Columbia Breast Cancer Outcomes Database who were diagnosed between 1997 and 2001 had better two-year overall survival (OS) than patients diagnosed between 1991 and 1995 (45 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The optimal measure of therapeutic efficacy is debated. OS is the gold standard for comparing therapies, but it requires prolonged follow-up and may be diluted by the effects of subsequent treatment. However, no other endpoint, including progression-free survival, time to tumor progression, or objective response rate, has been shown to be a good surrogate for OS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Comparisons of objective response rates are often used to determine relative treatment efficacy, but high response rates do not necessarily translate into clinically meaningful increases in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In addition, symptom relief without measurable disease response and achievement of stable disease as compared with disease progression may be clinically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134297\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMOR BIOLOGY AND RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic markers such as hormone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression, and tumor burden have both prognostic and predictive value and are important factors in selecting appropriate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361865859\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete evaluation for the extent of metastatic disease includes confirmatory biopsy of suspected lesions and reassessment of molecular markers, particularly estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 overexpression. This is especially important if the primary cancer was deemed negative for ER, PR, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HER2, since a conversion to positive would dramatically change therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1577314249\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of repeat biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data suggest that discordance of these markers between primary and metastatic disease may be clinically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a pooled analysis of two prospective studies that included 289 patients, the rates of discordance in ER, PR, and HER2 between the primary and recurrent disease were 13, 31, and 5.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The results of the biopsy altered management in 14 percent of patients who underwent a biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a separate prospective observational study that included 178 women, the conversion rate between primary and metastatic disease as reported by central laboratory analysis was similar to the findings above, with a discordance rate of 13, 28, and 3 percent for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among those patients who demonstrated a conversion in receptor status, ER (n = 22) and PR (n = 47) status converted from positive to negative (78 and 72 percent, respectively), and for HER2 status (n = 5), all went from positive to negative. </p><p/><p>In light of these findings, we advise patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease to undergo a repeat biopsy, which will not only establish the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, but will also allow a re-examination of receptor status. However, we acknowledge the lack of prospective data that verifying receptor status in new metastases and the resultant management changes will ultimately lead to improvements in patient quality of life and survival. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131955\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical factors that predict the rate of progression and survival include the interval between initial therapy and relapse, the number of metastatic sites, the presence or absence of visceral involvement, and biologic markers. The role of these factors is discussed separately.

In contrast, breast cancers that overexpress p-glycoprotein (gp170), a drug efflux pump that mediates multidrug resistance (MDR), or have a mutated p53 gene may be less likely to respond to chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. At present, none of these markers should be used to make clinical decisions.</p><p>Another possible approach is the use of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. However, the clinical utility of these assays remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/35,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42,43</a>]. The detection and monitoring of circulating tumor cells during treatment for metastatic breast cancer is discussed below.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aim of treatment is to palliate symptoms, prolong survival, and maintain quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with visceral metastases (especially if rapidly progressing) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a short disease-free interval generally have an aggressive phenotype, while patients with soft tissue and bone metastases have a more indolent phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression are important in estimating prognosis and the likelihood of response to therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone receptor [PR]) status is the major determining factor for response to endocrine therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Likewise, HER2 overexpression is required for response to HER2-directed therapies. </p><p/><p>Based upon these principles, selection of treatment can be individualized. Endocrine therapy is best used for patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and not for patients with hormone-negative breast cancer. HER2-directed therapy is only appropriate for patients with tumors that overexpress HER2. Lastly, chemotherapy is indicated for hormone-insensitive metastatic breast cancer (ie, patients with hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer and those with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who have become resistant to endocrine therapy). It is less clear when to use endocrine therapy versus chemotherapy as initial treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Likewise, it is less obvious when to use single agent versus combination chemotherapy, how to best incorporate biologic therapies, and whether combined modalities are of benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine therapy versus chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is commonly thought that chemotherapy results in higher response rates and more rapid responses than endocrine therapy, and it is often used as the initial treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer with a poor prognosis, especially those with visceral metastases. A meta-analysis that included eight small randomized trials, all published prior to 1995, compared the response rates for chemotherapy alone with those of endocrine therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The pooled estimate of response rates showed an advantage for chemotherapy over endocrine therapy (relative risk 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.54), although the two largest trials had opposite findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. No significant difference was seen in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.12), and on subset analysis, there was no obvious trend to suggest an effect of age, menopausal status, or pattern of metastatic disease on the efficacy of either therapy. There was minimal and contrasting information on quality of life and toxicity.</p><p>A major limitation to these findings is that most patients in these trials had tumors of unknown hormone receptor status, since the predictive value of hormone receptor status on response to endocrine therapy was not yet appreciated. Nevertheless, chemotherapy remains the preferred modality for initial treatment of patients with rapidly progressive symptomatic disease or visceral crisis (end-organ dysfunction), given the higher likelihood of achieving a response with chemotherapy.</p><p>No survival benefit has been seen when chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were combined. (See <a href=\"#H361862540\" class=\"local\">'Combining treatment modalities'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129020\"><span class=\"h2\">Sequential single agents versus combination chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, single-agent chemotherapy, used in sequence, is preferable to combination chemotherapy, since the single-agent chemotherapy is reasonably likely to induce palliation with fewer side effects, and no studies have demonstrated an OS benefit for the combination chemotherapy as long as both drugs are available in sequence. Combination chemotherapy (rather than single agent sequential therapy) is most appropriate when the higher chance of response is assessed to be more important than the potential for higher treatment toxicity, due to concerns about impending organ dysfunction from existing or rapidly progressing disease burden. However, both clinicians and patients should know there are no prospective data that show that combination chemotherapy improves overall survival compared with single agent sequential cytotoxic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-women-chemotherapy#H99380180\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women: Chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Combination chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361862540\"><span class=\"h2\">Combining treatment modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In theory, combining chemotherapy, biologic therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endocrine therapy might have additive efficacy, but it might also lead to increased toxicity. Clinical trials have failed to show a survival advantage for the concurrent administration of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy over either single modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/7,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,46,47</a>]. </p><p>However, HER2-directed therapy, namely <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lapatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lapatinib</a>, has been successfully combined as individual agents with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and with each other.

Therefore, these should usually be used as initial treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive disease. However, despite limitations described above, chemotherapy induces higher response rates than endocrine therapy. Therefore, patients with rapidly progressive, symptomatic disease or visceral metastases with end-organ dysfunction may be best treated with first-line chemotherapy. After chemotherapy response stabilizes (usually four to six months), a switch to maintenance endocrine therapy is a commonly employed strategy, which can reduce the treatment side effects without compromising overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/7,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,48,49</a>]. </p><p>Given its generally favorable toxicity profile, first-line endocrine therapy is more appropriate for most patients except those with severe symptoms or rapidly progressive visceral involvement. If the disease progresses rapidly (within a few months) following initiation of first-line endocrine therapy, chemotherapy is generally recommended as a second-line therapy rather than switching to another endocrine strategy.

Physical examination may allow response quantitation if disease is easily accessible (eg, chest wall nodules, palpable lymphadenopathy). With a dramatic reduction in symptoms that were clearly disease-related or obvious shrinkage of palpable lesions, serum markers and radiographic tests are likely to be irrelevant.</p><p>However, many patients have more subtle disease signs or symptoms that may be confused with treatment toxicity or other nonmalignant conditions. In addition, disease is not measurable by physical examination in nearly half of patients with metastatic breast cancer. In these patients, serial changes in tumor markers or radiographic studies are essential in establishing the response to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial assay of serum tumor markers (eg, CA15-3 and CA27.29, both products of the MUC-1 gene, and CEA) can aid in response assessment, particularly if disease sites are not assessable by usual criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Judicious use of serial tumor marker measurements may decrease the need for periodic radiographic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) expert panel suggest that it is reasonable to evaluate CA15-3, CA27.29, and CEA initially in patients with metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. If CA15-3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CA27.29 are elevated, there is no role for monitoring CEA, but if not, serial measurement of CEA levels may be useful.</p><p>Elevated tumor markers may occasionally be spurious. Up to 20 percent of patients successfully treated with systemic therapy may experience a transient increase (marker &quot;flare&quot;) during the first one or two months after treatment initiation, presumably due to release of antigen by cytolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Patients with abnormal liver function may also have falsely elevated marker levels because they are cleared by the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. CA 15-3 levels may be aberrantly elevated in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia, as well as in patients with thalassemia or sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can permit assessment of tumor response. Periodic scintigraphic bone scans, while helpful, may also be misleading. Technetium (Tc99) phosphonate accumulates in areas of osteoblastic activity rather than in cancer cells. In a patient experiencing a response to therapy, a &quot;scintigraphic healing flare&quot; may appear as early as two months and persist for as long as 12 months after initiating therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. </p><p>Integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> is popular as a whole-body examination in monitoring response to therapy in metastatic breast cancer, as it has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in detecting metastatic disease and can reliably assess response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. There is also some evidence that metabolic changes in bone metastases in response to systemic therapy (ie, a change in standardized uptake value [SUV]) can predict response duration or time to progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. However, many integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanners in clinical use provide a limited CT scan primarily for orientational purposes (determining where the PET abnormality is) and not a higher resolution, fine cut, contrast-enhanced CT scan. This should be kept in mind when evaluating response between modalities (standard CT and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT)</span>. There are no studies to demonstrate whether it is preferable to monitor patients with either <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> or scintigraphic bone scanning and dedicated CT or MRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulating tumor cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood samples of patients with metastatic breast cancer (&ge;5 CTCs) has been shown to be a predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-76</a>]. Immunological and RNA-based methods are used to detect CTCs in breast cancer. Although multiple commercially available methods for isolating CTCs exist, the CellSearch system (Veridex Corporation, Warren, NJ) is the only system approved in the United States for clinical use to detect the presence of CTCs in patients with breast cancer. In a prospective trial of 177 patients who were beginning a new therapy for metastatic breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], elevated CTCs at baseline (defined as five or more CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood) compared with the finding of fewer or no detectable CTCs predicted a significantly shorter PFS (three versus seven months) and OS (10 versus 22 months). Patients with elevated CTCs at the first follow-up visit (within three to five weeks of initiating therapy) also had a worse PFS (two versus seven months) and OS (8 versus greater than 18 months), whereas those with a decrease in the number of CTCs from baseline had improved PFS and OS. Subsequent analyses from this trial and others have suggested that elevated levels of CTCs at any time point during treatment are associated with tumor progression and that CTC levels may reliably estimate disease progression earlier than imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/73,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,76,77</a>]. While these data support the prognostic value of CTCs, their role in the monitoring of patients remains controversial. Therefore, we agree with ASCO expert panels, which have concluded that measurement of CTCs should not be used to influence treatment decisions in metastatic disease at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/54,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,78</a>].

In these instances, treatment may be directed at the area of recurrence using surgery or radiation therapy (RT). For those patients who have undergone successful treatment of limited disease and have no other evidence of disease, the role of systemic therapy has been controversial. The data involving the role of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy are discussed below.</p><p>Of note, there are no prospective data to inform the benefits of systemic treatment among patients who achieve an excellent clinical response after treatment of limited disease involving the central nervous system (eg, brain metastases).

However, the results of a randomized trial suggest there is a benefit to post-excision chemotherapy, particularly among women with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. </p><p>In the Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for Locally Recurrent breast cancer (CALOR) trial, 162 patients who underwent surgical resection of locally recurrent breast cancer were randomly assigned to post-excision chemotherapy treatment (with the regimen determined by the patient&rsquo;s treating oncologist) or to no treatment (control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. All patients were advised to undergo RT, although RT was mandatory for women with microscopically involved surgical margins. Of the patients enrolled, the majority had a hormone receptor-positive recurrence (68 percent). Compared with the control group, more women in the treatment group were chemotherapy-naive (42 versus 32 percent, respectively) and premenopausal at the time of recurrence (24 versus 18 percent). A similar proportion of women underwent RT for their isolated local recurrence (36 versus 38 percent). </p><p>At a median follow-up of 4.9 years, five-year disease-free survival for those receiving versus not receiving chemotherapy was 69 versus 57 percent (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0&middot;35-0&middot;99). Adjuvant chemotherapy was more effective for women with ER-negative isolated locoregional recurrences, though the differences in disease-free survival according to hormone-receptor status of the primary tumor were not statistically significant.</p><p>These data support the use of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer following resection for locoregional recurrence. However, interpretation of the study is limited by the small sample size, which was driven by challenges in recruitment, resulting in early termination of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In addition, there were relatively few events, especially in the ER-positive breast cancer cohort. Therefore, questions about the benefits of treatment based on tumor location (eg, chest wall versus regional nodal recurrence), prior treatment with chemotherapy or RT, or breast cancer subtype (eg, triple-negative, HER2-positive, or hormone receptor-positive) remain unresolved. </p><p>Despite these caveats, the data support the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy following tumor resection in women with ER-negative disease (in whom endocrine therapy is not an option). Women with ER-positive disease should be treated with endocrine therapy; clinicians should discuss the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy with these patients and decisions should be individualized, taking into account the patient&rsquo;s goals and preferences. All women with HER2-positive disease should receive a HER2-directed agent.</p><p>For patients who may receive RT in addition to systemic therapy (eg, following resection of disease), we prefer to administer chemotherapy prior to initiation of RT as in the adjuvant setting (and in the CALOR trial). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97037787\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should be treated with endocrine therapy regardless of whether chemotherapy was administered.

Patients with hormone receptor-positive disease may also be considered for treatment with olaparib if they have progressed after one line of endocrine therapy.
