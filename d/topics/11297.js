Approximately one-third of ambulatory anesthesia services for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the United States are provided as MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], often in out-of-operating-room locations.</p><p>This topic will discuss preoperative evaluation for patients who will receive MAC, monitoring during MAC, and the medications and sedation techniques commonly used during MAC. Procedural sedation by non-anesthesia clinicians and the drugs and techniques used for general anesthesia are discussed separately.

In anticipation of MAC, the patient should be evaluated for conditions that increase sensitivity to sedative and analgesic medications (eg, older age; obstructive sleep apnea; advanced chronic lung disease; pulmonary hypertension; coronary, liver, or renal disease; anxiety disorders; chronic pain; use of opioids, sedatives, or recreational drugs) to allow appropriate drug dosing and administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343054924\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway management may be necessary if sedation becomes deeper than intended or if general anesthesia is required during a planned MAC anesthetic. Therefore, the preoperative consultation should include an assessment of the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F98505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98505 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108981 \">table 2</a>) and risk factors for aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F98506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506 \">table 3</a>) and education about routine preoperative fasting guidelines as for general anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94641 \">table 4</a>).

Procedures that limit access to the airway (eg, head and neck procedures, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may be performed under light levels of sedation or under general anesthesia with airway control.</p><p>General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be a more appropriate choice than MAC for procedures that limit airway access and require deeper levels of sedation, especially in patients at high risk of aspiration if airway protective reflexes are diminished. Alternatively, for some procedures, regional anesthesia techniques (eg, peripheral nerve blocks, local anesthetic infiltration) or neuraxial anesthesia may be used to allow lighter levels of sedation that maintain airway reflexes.</p><p>When assessing the appropriateness of MAC, we also evaluate the following patient abilities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lie motionless in the position required for the procedure </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>MAC may not be appropriate for procedures that require immobility in patients who may not be able to remain still in supine position without excessively deep sedation or general anesthesia (eg, essential tremor, persistent cough, orthopnea). Patients with arthritis or other joint problems may be unable to lie in the lateral position because of shoulder or hip pain, or prone because of neck pain, without excessively deep sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cooperate, if necessary </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients with cognitive dysfunction, dementia, extreme anxiety, and barriers to communication may be unable to cooperate when necessary (eg, during awake craniotomy or thyroplasty).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Communicate with care providers </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Verbal communication is required during MAC for assessment of the depth of sedation, explanation, and reassurance.

In addition, exhaled carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring (capnography) is a standard monitor for patients who receive moderate or deep sedation or general anesthesia. During sedation, capnography facilitates early detection of apnea and airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], predicts the development of hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and may reduce patient injury related to respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

If sedatives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesic medications are administered during MAC, the depth of sedation must be continually assessed to avoid oversedation or general anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2743659574\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical assessment of sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ASA has created widely accepted definitions for minimal, moderate, and deep sedation based on responsiveness to verbal, tactile, and painful stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109909 \">table 5</a>). According to these definitions, patients who have received deep sedation respond only to either repeated or painful stimulation, may require airway intervention, and may have inadequate spontaneous ventilation. Importantly, any patient who is unarousable with a painful stimulus is, by definition, under general anesthesia.</p><p>In addition to the ASA definitions, other validated instruments for assessment of level of sedation that can be used during MAC include the Ramsay Sedation Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65842 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and the Modified Observer's Assessment of <span class=\"nowrap\">Alertness/Sedation</span> Scale (MOASS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110274 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, these scales are most commonly used in intensive care settings or for research purposes. In clinical practice, in the author's experience, depth of sedation is usually assessed by repeated evaluations of the patient's arousability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3996661609\"><span class=\"h3\">Processed electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Processed electroencephalography (EEG) monitors are often used during general anesthesia to provide information about the depth of anesthesia. The most commonly used device is the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, which provides a score from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the awake state; a score &lt;60 corresponds to general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The relationship between BIS values and the level of sedation varies among patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the literature on this correlation is conflicting. Several observational studies have reported good correlation between the BIS value and sedation scale scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>], while others have reported poor correlation, especially during light to moderate sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1181392080\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) may not be necessary in patients with normal cardiopulmonary function having MAC with minimal sedation.

Of the medications used for MAC, midazolam most reliably provides amnesia. Midazolam <strong>potentiates the effects of other sedatives and opioids</strong>, and can cause respiratory depression when given in high doses or with other sedatives or opioids. </p><p>The onset of action of an IV bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> occurs in about one to three minutes, with peak effect at approximately five minutes. The elimination half-life of midazolam is one to four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A small dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (eg, 0.5 to 2 mg IV, doses adjusted in older adult patients) is commonly administered as premedication before entering the procedure room and is often administered before starting a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> infusion. Midazolam is rarely used as the primary sedative for longer cases under MAC because repeated doses or infusions can result in sedation, confusion, and amnesia that lasts into the postoperative period. A number of studies comparing recovery after sedation during MAC have reported more rapid psychomotor recovery with propofol than with midazolam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>The benzodiazepine antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> may be used to reverse the sedation induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, but it has limited efficacy for reversal of respiratory depression. Thus, patients with respiratory depression who have also received opioids should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, an opioid antagonist, before or rather than flumazenil. The dose of flumazenil in adults is 0.2 mg IV given over 15 seconds, which may be repeated every minute to a maximum of 1 mg. The duration of action of flumazenil is approximately 20 to 40 minutes, which may be shorter than the residual effects of midazolam. Therefore, patients who have received flumazenil should be monitored for signs of resedation. In the event of resedation, flumazenil can be repeated at 20-minute intervals as needed, at 0.2 mg IV per minute, to a maximum dose of 1 mg, or 3 mg in an hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3175587877\"><span class=\"h2\">Propofol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> is a rapidly acting, short-acting <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/hypnotic</span> with modest amnestic and antiemetic properties at subhypnotic doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] without analgesic effects. Propofol is widely used for MAC because of its pharmacokinetic profile, including rapid effect site equilibration and short elimination half-time even after prolonged infusion. Thus, the depth of sedation can be adjusted rapidly, and patients recover quickly without residual psychomotor effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

Propofol has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that patients may rapidly transition to deeper levels of sedation, including general anesthesia. There is no reversal agent for propofol, so oversedated patients must be managed with supportive measures, including proper airway management, until the drug wears off.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> causes pain on injection in as many as 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A variety of methods for prevention and treatment of propofol pain have been used, including placement of intravenous (IV) catheters in antecubital veins rather than smaller veins, pretreatment with opioids, and injection of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, with or without proximal vein occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Computer-controlled methods of administration (used primarily outside the United States) and patient-controlled methods of administration have also been used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525758841\"><span class=\"h2\">Bolus versus infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal method for drug delivery may depend on the duration and stimulation of the procedure and the drugs administered. In general, continuous infusion is often used for drugs with very short duration of action (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>) in an attempt to maintain stable blood levels of the drug. However, the benefits of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus are not clear and may depend on the procedure and patients. Studies on the use of propofol for short gynecologic procedures, flexible bronchoscopy, and colonoscopy have reported that bolus techniques result in less total propofol administered, though with similar recovery times, compared with continuous infusion techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278617172\"><span class=\"h2\">Target-controlled infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Target-controlled infusion (TCI) is a mode of drug administration with an infusion pump that uses pharmacokinetic models to calculate infusion rates necessary to achieve desired plasma or effect-site concentrations. The anesthesia clinician sets a desired effect-site target concentration (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> rather than the infusion rate that would be selected for a standard infusion pump (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute)</span>. The primary difference between TCI and manually adjusted infusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/bolus</span> administration is that the TCI system reduces infusion rates to account for drug distribution and elimination. Examples of plasma concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> that correlate with different levels of sedation using TCI are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110276 \">table 9</a>).</p><p>The literature comparing the use of TCI systems with manual administration of sedatives is inconclusive.
