Heroin use in the United States has increased since 2000 (eg, the number of past-year users increased from 373,000 to 828,000 between 2007 and 2015). Along with this increase in heroin use, there also has been an increase in heroin-related overdose deaths with nearly 13,000 reported in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Three million, eight-hundred thousand people in the United States aged 12 and older reported past month misuse of a prescription pain medication in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Approximately two-thirds of people who primarily use heroin have been reported to additionally use prescription opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and there is evidence that the first opioid abused is most frequently a prescription opioid, rather than heroin (as was the case in the 1960s through 1980s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Heroin use is increasing for persons who begin by first having nonmedical use of opioid analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Prescription opioids are most commonly obtained from a relative or friend rather than directly from a clinician, but prescription-opioid users at highest risk of overdose are as likely to get them from a clinician as a relative or friend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511972\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients prescribed opioid analgesics, risk factors for misuse of these medications include a prior history of substance use disorder, certain demographic features (such as younger age), more severe pain, and co-occurring mental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although the associations are less robust, these are also believed to be risk factors for opioid use disorder. Patient risk factors for prescribed opioid misuse and opioid use disorder are described in greater detail separately.

G proteins are molecular intermediaries that initiate the intracellular communication process. Stimulation of G proteins begins the intracellular process of signal transduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptide-hormone-signal-transduction-and-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptide hormone signal transduction and regulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Activation of endogenous mu opioid receptors results in the prototypic opioid effects of reward, withdrawal, and analgesia. Mu receptor activation can mediate a variety of G proteins that lead to secondary effects on messenger-generating enzymes (adenyl cyclase and phospholipase-C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Secondary messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) are acutely decreased by opioid receptor activation. Chronic opioid receptor activation results in molecular effects opposite to those of acute opioid administration. Long-term opioid use causes up regulation of cAMP along with changes in gene transcription.</p><p>Opioid receptors are located in the central and peripheral nervous system. The effects of activation of neuronal mu receptors will depend on the location of the receptor, the types of G proteins present in the activated neural tissues, and the frequency and duration of activation. Activation of mu receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) results in responses such as respiratory depression, analgesia, euphoria, and miosis. Stimulation of peripheral mu opioid receptors, in smooth muscle of the bronchi and intestines, results in cough suppression and opioid-induced constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134293705\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heroin has a half-life of 30 minutes but a duration of action of four to five hours due to active metabolites, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Heroin is metabolized to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], a metabolite specific to heroin, detectable on urine testing. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Like all opioids, heroin binds to receptors that are part of the endogenous opioid systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Certain opioids can also act on several other CNS neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Heroin is more lipid soluble than other opioids, allowing it to rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier (within 15 to 20 seconds) and to reach high brain levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363392383\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 1 and 7 percent of Caucasians of European descent have a genetic defect placing them at risk of respiratory depression from small doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

If they have injected opioids, then fresh injection sites may be visible on the physical examination. The duration of acute intoxication will depend upon the half-life of the drug taken as well as the patient&rsquo;s tolerance to opioids.</p><p>Patients who have developed tolerance to opioids may show no acute effects after use of the drug at a dose typical for that patient. They may be presenting for treatment of their addiction, but when hospitalized for other reasons may show signs of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Patients with OUD typically have impaired social functioning, which in our clinical experience can vary widely in association with the severity and duration of the disorder. Patients with a mild disorder may maintain jobs and relationships, but detailed interviewing can often reveal problems related to drug use.</p><p>Patients with a severe disorder may present impoverished and engaged in illegal behavior (eg, shoplifting, burglary, prostitution) to obtain money with which to purchase heroin or other opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Use of heroin (or other illicit opioids) can become the organizing feature in the lives of some patients, and their day is centered on either obtaining money to purchase the drug or using the drug. Other aspects of life, such as work and relationships, may be sacrificed for their drug use. While this lifestyle can lead to legal problems, many users are not antisocial (or sociopathic); once they achieve stability, such as through engagement in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> treatment, problems with the law no longer occur; other aspects of their life (work, relationships) also return to more normal patterns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13087502\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe opioid use disorder (OUD) sometimes appear debilitated and in poor general health.

As an example, a study of persons undergoing a three-day inpatient medically supervised withdrawal from opioids found only 17 percent of patients reported being abstinent from opioids at a 30-day follow-up after discharge, although drug use decreased and treatment engagement increased following the withdrawal treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Heroin purchased on the street may contain 10 to 40 percent active drug; the rest is an adulterant such as sugar, powdered milk, over-the-counter medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> (to counteract some of the drowsiness associated with the high), or even a prescription medication. Heroin becomes progressively more diluted and adulterated as it moves down the distribution chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Dealers and consumers generally do not know the proportion of heroin in the product they sell or use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The amount of drug being consumed influences the likelihood and severity of withdrawal symptoms when the drug is stopped, so it is useful to obtain an estimate of the amount used (frequency and number of times per day). In the eastern United States, heroin users typically describe their quantity of use as number of &ldquo;bags&rdquo; of powder heroin. In the western United States, the quantity of tar heroin is typically characterized as fractions of a gram. People with an opioid use disorder (OUD) typically use heroin two to six times a day.</p><p>Another way to estimate quantity is to ask the patient how much he or she has been spending on heroin on the average day or week. Drug prices <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the amount of pure heroin in a bag of a fixed amount vary widely based upon geography (even between neighborhoods), by demand, by amount of adulterant added, and over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A typical &quot;quarter bag&quot; ($25 worth) has enough adulterated heroin powder to snort several lines or inject several times, depending on the tolerance of the buyer. Amounts used can range from $20 to $200 per day.</p><p>It is important to determine if the patient uses other drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol in addition to opioids. Obtaining an accurate history can be complicated, as patients may accelerate use of one substance (eg, alcohol) during times when heroin is less available. The clinician must accurately identify patients who need concomitant treatment for physiological dependence on alcohol or a benzodiazepine because withdrawal from these drugs can be life-threatening.</p><p>Inquire specifically about nonmedical use of prescription opioids, which many heroin users also consume. Ask about the drug, dose, and average number of tablets consumed daily. Over 10 percent of nonmedical use of prescription opioids involves &quot;snorting&quot; the tablet contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13087954\"><span class=\"h3\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For both heroin and prescription opioids, ask about the route of administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intravenous (IV) route is rapid and produces high bioavailability but is also most dangerous to the user. Injection is the most efficient means of producing euphoria when relatively low-purity heroin is being used. Most overdoses occur when heroin is taken intravenously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intranasal inhalation requires minimal equipment and the onset of action is rapid enough to produce euphoria. Increased purity and potency of heroin in the United States and concerns about overdose have resulted in a rising prevalence of heroin snorting in many areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids can be smoked; this is more common in Asian countries, where it is known as &quot;chasing the dragon,&quot; but has become more popular worldwide, including some cities in the United States. Smoking opioids is the fastest route for delivering the drug to the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13085539\"><span class=\"h3\">Tolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should determine whether the patient has been using larger and larger amounts of heroin to get the same effect. This demonstrates tolerance to opioids and indicates that the patient is likely to experience withdrawal symptoms if he or she abruptly stops using. Many persons with OUD start out using heroin to get high then reach a point where they must use simply to avoid withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Persons who have recently consumed an opioid and are tolerant to its effects may not show obvious signs of intoxication or withdrawal; injection sites may not be apparent on examination. A careful history, if possible including secondary informants, may help the clinician to identify the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435668776\"><span class=\"h3\">Last use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should determine the date of last use and the dose, frequency and pattern of use at that time. This information, along with other history and examination, can be used to determine acute consequences for the OUD patient who has ceased to use opioids, eg, upon hospital admission. Symptoms of withdrawal, for example, indicate that the patient has developed physical dependence on opioids and may require medically supervised withdrawal treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435668783\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask whether and when the patient has received substance use disorder treatment and what type (medically supervised withdrawal, opioid maintenance with medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, inpatient, residential, outpatient counseling, or self-help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous). Asking the length of the longest period of abstinence helps predict the patient's ability to maintain abstinence in the future. In our clinical experience, abstaining from heroin for at least one year suggests a favorable prognosis for remaining abstinent again for a significant period of time.</p><p>Asking about problems that have resulted from drug use helps the patient to begin thinking about reasons to stop using drugs. Patients should be asked about past and present physical and psychiatric conditions as well as legal and social problems, especially if the patient has lost jobs, relationships, or freedom as a consequence of heroin use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A physical examination should be conducted to elucidate common complications of opioid use <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> assist in diagnosing OUD. Chronic intravenous use can be confirmed by the presence of &quot;track marks,&rdquo; which are callouses and scars that follow the course of a subcutaneous vein. These are caused by repeated injections into adjacent sites over an accessible vein. Tracks are often found in easily accessible body areas, such as the backs of the hands, antecubital fossae, on the legs, or in the neck. Signs of recent injection may be found in unusual places in patients attempting to hide their sites of injection. A thorough examination for tracks or recent injection sites should include looking between the fingers and toes, under the fingernails and toenails, in the axillae, breast veins, and the dorsal vein of the penis.</p><p>The nasal septum should be examined for perforation from repeated intranasal insufflation (especially when cocaine is mixed with heroin and snorted). A heart murmur may indicate subacute bacterial endocarditis. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may suggest early viral infection, especially with HIV. Hepatic enlargement may indicate acute hepatitis; a small, hard liver is consistent with chronic viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B or C virus, which is common among injection drug users.</p><p>Signs of opioid intoxication may include pinpoint pupils, drowsiness, slurred speech, and impaired cognition. Signs of acute opioid withdrawal syndrome include watering eyes, runny nose, yawning, muscle twitching, hyperactive bowel sounds, and piloerection.
