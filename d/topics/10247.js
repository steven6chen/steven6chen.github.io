Fluid therapy is usually divided into two components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy replaces the ongoing daily losses of water and electrolytes occurring via physiologic processes (urine, sweat, respiration, and stool), which normally preserve homeostasis.

These regulatory mechanisms allow for variability in the daily water intake in healthy children without adverse effect.</p><p>Historically, water requirements for children receiving parenteral fluid therapy were directly derived in relationship to caloric energy expenditures of hospitalized children on bed rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Under normal physiologic conditions, combined daily insensible and sensible losses equal about 100 mL for every 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> of energy expended. This includes the minimal daily obligate urine volume of 25 ml for every 100 kcal of energy expenditure necessary to excrete the solutes generated by dietary intake and cell metabolism.</p><p>Daily caloric expenditure for healthy children varies directly with body weight, with the rate changing over several broad weight ranges.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight less than 10 kg &minus; 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight &gt;10 kg to 20 kg &minus; 1000 kcal for first 10 kg of body weight plus 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> for any increment of weight above 10 kg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight &gt;20 kg to 80 kg &minus; 1500 kcal for first 20 kg of body weight plus 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> for any increment of weight above 20 kg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight &gt;80 kg &minus; 2700 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> with adjustments made as clinically pertinent for either increased or decrease caloric needs to meet metabolic demands</p><p/><p>Daily water needs replace insensible water losses from the respiratory tract and skin, and sensible water losses in urine and stool output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily insensible losses (loss that is not perceived by the individual and cannot be usually measured) account for approximately 45 mL per 100 kcal of energy expended. In patients greater than 10 kg, the insensible needs are also often calculated based upon body surface area at a rate of about 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span>. The insensible losses can be further delineated into skin or respiratory losses:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin losses, due to evaporation from convection and conduction, account for two-thirds of the insensible losses (30 mL per 100 kcal). Infants and small children have a proportionally greater body surface area per unit of body weight than larger children and adults resulting in a relatively higher insensible skin loss of water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory losses, due to the warming and humidification of inspired air, account for one-third of insensible losses (15 mL per 100 kcal).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily sensible water losses (losses are perceived by the senses and can be measured) account for approximately 55 mL per 100 kcal of energy expenditure. Since water loss from stool is negligible in healthy children, sensible water loss is primarily due to the daily urinary water losses required to excrete the solute load generated from typical dietary intake and cellular metabolism. This estimate is based on a few assumptions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A normal and age-appropriate dietary solute load and urine that is isosmotic to plasma (approximately 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Normal urinary concentrating mechanisms in terms of both ADH release from the pituitary and renal response to ADH availability. Thus, maximal stimulation of ADH release accompanied by a maximal renal concentrating response (urine osmolality of 1200 to 1400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L)</span> are required to excrete the daily solute load in a minimal daily obligate urine volume. Patients with a diminished ability to concentrate urine due to low release or renal response to ADH require a larger urine volume for excretion of daily solute load. Inadequate ADH release or renal responsiveness to ADH may result in dehydration and hypernatremia, and inappropriate (excessive) release of ADH results in free water retention and hyponatremia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Methods for calculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods to calculate water requirements are based on the historic observation of caloric energy expenditures of hospitalized children requiring parenteral fluid therapy on bed rest in the 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The two methods that are routinely used to prescribe parenteral fluid therapy assume that approximately 100 mL of exogenous water are needed to replace insensible and sensible losses for every 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> of energy expended. Both methods take into account the relationship between caloric expenditure and total body weight, as noted above. These calculations also assume urinary losses are isosmotic to plasma and that there is no ongoing aberrant physiologic process such as inappropriate ADH release. Since the normal kidney can both concentrate and dilute the urine, healthy children generally tolerate fluid volumes below or above these calculated values, but these calculations serve as a starting point to prescribe maintenance fluid volume.</p><p>One method calculates a total daily volume of water and the other provides fluid needs based on an hourly rate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Method 1</strong> &ndash; Maintenance fluid needed on an hourly basis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weight less than 10 kg &minus; 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weight &gt;10 kg to 20 kg &minus; 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for first 10 kg of body weight plus 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for any increment of weight over 10 kg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weight &gt;20 kg&minus; 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for first 20 kg of body weight plus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for any increment of weight over 20 kg, to a maximum of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (up to a maximum of 2400 mL daily)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Method 2</strong> &ndash; Maintenance fluid volume for a 24-hour period (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-maintenance-fluid-calculation-for-children\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weight less than 10 kg &minus; 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weight &gt;10 kg to 20 kg &minus; 1000 mL for first 10 kg of body weight plus 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> for any increment of weight over 10 kg</p><p/><p>The total daily volume of water prescribed by the hourly format is a bit lower than the daily format, but the difference is almost always of no clinical significance. For example, the maintenance water needs for a 12 kg child are calculated using both methods as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Utilizing the hourly method, the maintenance needs would be 44 mL per hour or 1056 mL for 24 hours (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for the first 10 kg of body weight, plus 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for the next 2 kg [2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for each kg of body weight between 10 and 20 kg]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Utilizing the 24-hour method, the maintenance needs would be slightly higher at 1100 mL for 24 hours (1000 mL for the first 10 kg, plus 100 mL for the next 2 kg [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day for each kg of body weight between 10 and 20 kg]).</p><p/><p>Caveats that should be taken into consideration when calculating water needs for children using either method are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At body weights &gt;65 kg, water requirements do not show the same incremental increase as with lower weights. As a result, for individuals with a body weight &gt;65 kg, total maintenance water needs are generally capped at 2.4 liters daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children who are hospitalized or who are postoperative, the risk for inappropriate (excessive) ADH release is high. As a result, a routine calculation of maintenance water volumes in hospitalized or postoperative children may predispose to hyponatremia if water or sodium replacement is not adjusted.

In children, the daily sodium, chloride, and potassium requirements can be related to daily water needs as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium and chloride &minus; 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/100</span> mL of water per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium &minus; 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/100</span> mL of water per day</p><p/><p>Urinary electrolyte losses account for the majority of maintenance electrolyte needs, with fewer electrolyte losses normally accompanying the typical insensible water losses in sweat and stool. As is the case with water balance, maintenance electrolyte intake may vary from day to day depending on clinical circumstance. For example, sodium and potassium intake may need to be reduced in patients with oliguric renal failure to prevent volume expansion and hyperkalemia; conversely, their intake may need to be increased in patients with diarrhea or burns to prevent volume depletion and hypokalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254791451\"><span class=\"h2\">Dextrose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dextrose is added to maintenance fluids when the clinician decides to provide an additional source of glucose to the patient. Under normal circumstances, 5 to 10 percent dextrose solution administered at a maintenance rate is safe, as this amount of dextrose is taken up rapidly by cells and does not remain in the intravascular space. As a result, dextrose is not a relevant factor when considering tonicity of intravenous (IV) fluid compared to sodium. As a result, in this topic, references to isotonic fluid only apply to the sodium content and disregard the dextrose composition.</p><p>Dextrose should not be used in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, which may increase glucose levels, or hypokalemia.

In addition, the risk of hyponatremia was greater for the patients treated with 0.45 percent saline solution compared to those who received isotonic saline (30 versus 10 percent) regardless of the volume of fluid therapy. In this cohort, initial postsurgical ADH levels were two to four times normal but fell back to expected levels by 24 hours after surgery. These results highlight that an initial approach of providing isotonic fluid at maintenance fluid volume is preferred to avoid hypovolemia and hyponatremia especially while ascertaining the patient's needs, including the status of ADH release.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101859381\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach in prescribing parenteral fluid therapy in hospitalized children consists of the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial assessment of the patient's clinical condition and volume status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children/abstract/3,4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children who are volume depleted, therapy is first directed at repleting any estimated deficit with an isotonic solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a>). Volume repletion will remove any physiologic hypovolemia-induced stimulus to ADH release, thereby improving the ability to excrete free water.
