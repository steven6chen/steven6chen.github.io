It happens when a person's stomach and intestines get infected with a virus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). Both adults and children can get viral gastroenteritis.</p><p>People can get the infection if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touch an infected person or a surface with the virus on it, and then don't wash their hands</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods or drink liquids with the virus in them. If people with the virus don't wash their hands, they can spread it to food or liquids they touch.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295108951\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of viral gastroenteritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infection causes diarrhea and vomiting. People can have either diarrhea or vomiting, or both. These symptoms usually start suddenly, and can be severe.</p><p>Viral gastroenteritis can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A headache or muscle aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain or cramping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A loss of appetite</p><p/><p>If you have diarrhea and vomiting, your body can lose too much water. Doctors call this &quot;dehydration.&quot; Dehydration can make you have dark yellow urine and feel thirsty, tired, dizzy, or confused.</p><p>Severe dehydration can be life-threatening. Babies, young children, and elderly people are more likely to get severe dehydration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295108958\"><span class=\"h1\">Do people with viral gastroenteritis need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. Their doctor or nurse should be able to tell if they have it by learning about their symptoms and doing an exam. But the doctor or nurse might do tests to check for dehydration or to see which virus is causing the infection. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of bowel movement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295108966\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better or help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People with viral gastroenteritis need to drink enough fluids so they don't get dehydrated.</p><p>Some fluids help prevent dehydration better than others:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children and adults can drink sports drinks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can give babies and young children an &quot;oral rehydration solution,&quot; such as Pedialyte. You can buy this in a store or pharmacy. If your child is vomiting, you can try to give your child a few teaspoons of fluid every few minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Babies who breastfeed can continue to breastfeed.</p><p/><p>People with viral gastroenteritis should avoid drinking juice or soda. These can make diarrhea worse.</p><p>If you can keep food down, it's best to eat lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals. Avoid eating foods with a lot of fat or sugar, which can make symptoms worse.</p><p>If you are an adult younger than 65 and you have a new bout of diarrhea but no fever or blood in your bowel movements, you can take medicine to stop diarrhea such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loperamide</a> (brand name: Imodium) for 1 to 2 days. If you are older than 65, have a fever, or have blood in your bowel movements, do not take these medicines without checking with your doctor.</p><p>Do NOT give medicines to stop diarrhea to children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295108973\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse if you or your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has any symptoms of dehydration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has diarrhea or vomiting that lasts longer than a few days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits up blood, has bloody diarrhea, or has severe belly pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hasn't had anything to drink in a few hours (for children), or in many hours (for adults)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hasn't needed to urinate in the past 6 to 8 hours (during the day), or if your baby or young child hasn't had a wet diaper for 4 to 6 hours</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295108980\"><span class=\"h1\">How is viral gastroenteritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not need any treatment, because their symptoms will get better on their own. But people with severe dehydration might need treatment in the hospital for their dehydration. This involves getting fluids through an &quot;IV&quot; (a thin tube that goes into the vein).</p><p>Doctors do not treat viral gastroenteritis with antibiotics. That's because antibiotics treat infections that are caused by bacteria &ndash; not viruses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295108987\"><span class=\"h1\">Can viral gastroenteritis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. To lower the chance of getting or spreading the infection, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom or change your child's diaper, and before you eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid changing your child's diaper near where you prepare food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your baby gets the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotavirus vaccine</a>. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections. Rotavirus is a virus that commonly causes viral gastroenteritis in children.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295109051\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dehydration-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dehydration in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotavirus infection (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
