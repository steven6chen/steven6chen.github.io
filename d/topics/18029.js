Prior to that time, testicular cancer accounted for 11 percent of all cancer deaths in men between the ages of 25 and 34, and the five-year survival rate was 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are approximately 400 deaths from testicular cancer annually in the United States, and the five-year survival rate is over 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) are more sensitive to systemic chemotherapy than any other adult solid tumor. Conventional cisplatin-based regimens can cure up to 80 percent of patients with disseminated GCTs, including those with widespread visceral metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An additional group of patients who relapse or have refractory disease can be cured by high-dose chemotherapy. </p><p>As a result of these therapeutic successes, the majority of men with testicular GCTs are long-term survivors, and minimizing treatment-related toxicity from conventional and high-dose chemotherapy has become a prime concern.</p><p>The adverse effects of conventional doses of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in testicular GCTs are discussed in this topic. The management of long-term survivors and the late effects of radiation therapy (RT) are discussed separately, as is the general approach to treatment.

However, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with clinically important long-term toxicities.</p><p>An extensive study of the impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> chemotherapy on testicular cancer survivors comes from the multi-institutional Platinum Study Group, which assessed a wide range of adverse health outcomes in 952 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

None had received radiation therapy or salvage chemotherapy, and all were disease-free at the time of assessment. The median age was 37 years, and the median time following chemotherapy was 4.3 years. Patients were assessed with a brief physical examination, audiometric testing, and a detailed questionnaire regarding selected health outcomes.</p><p>No adverse health outcomes were detected or reported in 20 percent, one or two in 42 percent, three or four in 25 percent, and five or more in 13 percent of cases. The most commonly reported adverse health outcomes were tinnitus, hearing impairment, and peripheral neuropathy in 37, 32, and 27 percent of cases, respectively. A combination of peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity was observed in 16 percent. The patterns of toxicity were similar with the BEP and EP regimens, except that Reynaud phenomenon and obesity were more common with BEP (12 versus 21 and 26 versus 33 percent, respectively), while peripheral neuropathy was more common with EP (29 versus 21 percent). </p><p>Of note, ototoxicity was significantly more frequent when assessed with formal audiometric testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

While we do not use prophylactic hematopoietic growth factors (eg, granulocyte colony stimulating factors [G-CSF]) at the start of treatment, we recommend initiation of G-CSF in patients who develop low blood cell counts (on day 1 of the subsequent cycle) and those who had a complicated neutropenic event (eg, febrile neutropenia).

The incidence of bleomycin lung injury is cumulative, increasing significantly above 450 units. Predictive factors for the development of pulmonary toxicity include advanced age, prior or concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (RT), and renal dysfunction (particularly due to concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bleomycin-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately one-half of all treatment-related deaths in men treated with chemotherapy for testicular cancer are due to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which is fatal in 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence of fatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> lung toxicity with four cycles of bleomycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP) is 1 to 2 percent, but is less than 1 percent when BEP is limited to three cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-10</a>]. This low risk may be due to the fact that bleomycin is generally discontinued if patients show early signs of pneumonitis, although this is unproven.</p><p>Signs and symptoms suggestive of early lung toxicity include a non-productive cough, exertional dyspnea, and bibasilar crackles. Pulmonary nodules may be seen on chest imaging studies, although findings do not correlate with long-term damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nevertheless, it is standard practice to eliminate further <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> if radiographic changes are observed during treatment.</p><p>Although pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are neither sensitive nor specific for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> lung toxicity, the best diagnostic tool for early detection is measurement of the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A decline in DLCO may be the earliest sign of lung injury. At most centers, baseline PFTs are established prior to chemotherapy and are then repeated at the start of each new cycle. Several authors recommend that bleomycin be discontinued if the DLCO falls by 40 percent or if it falls to less than 60 percent of an individual's baseline value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

The most extensive data come from a series of 565 patients who were evaluated with PFTs before or after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although DLCO decreased during treatment, it rebounded to normal in most patients with long-term follow-up.
