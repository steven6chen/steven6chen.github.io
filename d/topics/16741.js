The manifestations of this disease are notoriously protean, with different stages occurring over time in untreated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Patients may seek evaluation for symptoms or signs of primary infection (eg, chancre), secondary infection (eg, diffuse rash), or tertiary infection (eg, symptoms of aortic insufficiency). Alternatively, patients may be completely asymptomatic and only identified on routine screening. The diagnosis of syphilis is most commonly made by serologic testing, a technique first described by Wasserman in 1906 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The appropriate use and interpretation of diagnostic testing are important for optimal patient management. Testing for syphilis will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, natural history, clinical manifestations, and treatment of this disorder, as well as the laboratory monitoring of patients undergoing therapy, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Treatment and monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHOM TO TEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic testing for syphilis should be performed on patients with signs or symptoms of infection. In addition, asymptomatic patients should be screened for syphilis if they are at high risk for having acquired disease or for transmitting disease to others. Serologic testing is generally used to make a diagnosis of syphilis. The approach to testing is described below. (See <a href=\"#H1818142166\" class=\"local\">'Approach to testing'</a> below.)</p><p>All persons who are diagnosed with a new syphilis infection should be treated. In addition, they should be offered HIV testing, as well as screening for other sexually transmitted infections.

However, in such patients, testing as often as every three months may increase the detection of syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

More frequent screening (every three to six months) is recommended for those with multiple sex partners, and those who engage in unprotected intercourse, sex in conjunction with illicit drug use, and methamphetamine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Screening can identify patients with asymptomatic disease who, if left untreated, could would otherwise be at risk for progression to late syphilis. Similarly, it can reduce syphilis transmission, since patients with unsuspected early primary or secondary disease can have lesions (eg, chancres and condyloma lata) that go unnoticed but are teeming with spirochetes, making them highly infectious to others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3201268139\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219329901\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests provide a presumptive diagnosis of syphilis. There are two types of serologic tests for syphilis: nontreponemal tests and treponemal-specific tests. The use of only one test is insufficient for diagnosis since serologic testing (especially nontreponemal tests) can be associated with false positive results. </p><p>False negative results can also occur since serologic testing relies upon a humoral immune response to infection. Thus, the use of serologic testing may be limited in patients with advanced immunosuppression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> early disease. As an example, although the majority of patients have a positive serologic test when they present with a chancre (ie, two to four weeks after exposure), approximately 20 to 30 percent have a nonreactive nontreponemal test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. For such patients, serologic testing generally turns positive within the next two to four weeks. (See <a href=\"#H3955025181\" class=\"local\">'Negative nontreponemal test in early syphilis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601231816\"><span class=\"h3\">Nontreponemal tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontreponemal tests (also known as tests for reagin antibodies) are based upon the reactivity of serum from infected patients to a cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen. Although these screening tests are nonspecific, and therefore not definitive, they have traditionally been used for initial syphilis screening due to their relatively low cost, ease of performance, and ability to be quantified for the purpose of following response to therapy.</p><p>Nontreponemal tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toluidine Red Unheated Serum Test (TRUST)</p><p/><p>In general, these assays are semi-quantitative in that the amount of antibody present (both IgM and IgG) generally reflects the activity of the infection. Positive nontreponemal tests are reported as a titer of antibody (eg, 1:32, which represents the detection of antibody in serum diluted 32-fold). Titers tend to wane over time even without treatment, but successful therapy accelerates the pace of antibody decline. Changes in titer are followed after treatment to detect a therapeutic response. </p><p>Both false positive and false negative results can be seen with nontreponemal tests as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3942014125\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of serologic testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2983491333\"><span class=\"h3\">Treponemal tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treponemal tests have historically been more complex and expensive to perform than nontreponemal tests. Thus, they have traditionally been used as confirmatory tests for syphilis when the nontreponemal tests are reactive. However, newer versions of these tests have been automated, enhancing simplicity and facilitating ease of use. As a result, these tests are increasingly used as an initial screening test for syphilis rather than as confirmatory tests. (See <a href=\"#H3314277445\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing algorithms'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific treponemal tests include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microhemagglutination test for antibodies to <em>T. pallidum </em>(MHA-TP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. pallidum</em> particle agglutination assay (TPPA)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. pallidum</em> enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA)</p><p/><p>As a group, these tests are based upon the detection of antibodies directed against specific treponemal antigens and thus tend to be more specific than nontreponemal tests. Treponemal tests are qualitative only and are reported as &quot;reactive&quot; or &quot;nonreactive&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The TP-EIA test has become the favored treponemal test in many laboratories, particularly those with large numbers of specimens for testing. </p><p>Once a patient has a positive treponemal test, this test usually remains positive for life. Thus, these tests are generally not useful for confirming a diagnosis of syphilis in a patient with prior treated disease. However, combinations of treponemal tests directed at different antigens can be used to diagnose late latent syphilis in some patients with discordant treponemal and nontreponemal serologies. (See <a href=\"#H3482561730\" class=\"local\">'Positive treponemal/negative nontreponemal test'</a> below and <a href=\"#H765195106\" class=\"local\">'Latent syphilis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253013140\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid serologic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid definitive diagnosis of syphilis was previously made using darkfield microscopy to examine exudates of lesions for the presence of <em>T. pallidum </em>organisms. This method, which is complex, is no longer routinely advocated or available in most clinics. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Direct methods for diagnosis'</a> below.). </p><p>A variety of rapid serologic tests for syphilis have been developed. Most are treponemal-specific tests, which do not distinguish between active and previously treated syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, they can be used to help guide initial treatment decisions in patients with possible infection, especially those who are unlikely to return for follow-up. Although available tests have been found to have good sensitivity and specificity, most have not been formally assessed by regulatory agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Newer point-of-care (POC) serologic tests, which incorporate a nontreponemal component to distinguish current from past infection, are not currently available in the United States. </p><p>In late 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration granted a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver permitting the use of a rapid (10-minute) fingerstick treponemal-based antibody test called the Syphilis Health Check (SHC). The SHC can be used in clinical settings (eg, physicians' offices, emergency rooms, maternity wards) and those that are community-based (eg, freestanding counseling and testing sites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The waiver allows both nonmedical persons and health care workers to perform these tests. However, further evaluation of the SHC is needed before widespread use of this POC test can be recommended. In a post-FDA approval evaluation of the SHC at a sexually transmitted infection clinic in Florida, the sensitivity and specificity of this test were found to be 71.4 and 91.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], which were lower than the &gt;95 percent sensitivity and specificity that were reported by the manufacturer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Additional studies evaluating the efficacy of rapid tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 33 studies that compared treponemal POC diagnostic tests for syphilis with a <em>T. pallidum</em>-specific reference standard, the POC tests had sensitivities ranging from 74 to 90 percent and specificities ranging from 94 to 99 percent when serum samples were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When whole blood samples were used, sensitivities ranged from 74 to 86 percent and specificities ranged from 96 to 100 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study using 1005 stored serum samples evaluated a dual <span class=\"nowrap\">treponemal/nontreponemal</span> POC test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When compared with standard tests, the concordance for samples with high titer nontreponemal antibodies was 94.3 percent, and the concordance for samples with low titers was 90.1 percent; however, the concordance with <span class=\"nowrap\">past/treated</span> infections was 27.5 percent. Notably, concordance was only 78.1 percent among stored samples from patients without syphilis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct methods for diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct methods can be used to provide a definitive diagnosis of syphilis. Since <em>T. pallidum</em> cannot be cultured in the laboratory, the organism must be identified through direct visualization or detection in clinical specimens. </p><p>Darkfield microscopy and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing can be used to detect the organism; however, neither of these tests are routinely available in clinical settings because these methods require special equipment to perform the test, as well as considerable experience and expertise to properly interpret the results. Thus, for most clinicians, such tests are now viewed as alternative diagnostic tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Some laboratories have developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect <em>T. pallidum</em> DNA from clinical specimens. Assays are based upon detection of various DNA target sequences, and use a variety of methods (eg, classical PCR, nested PCR, reverse-transcription PCR, and quantitative PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. These tests must be validated for use in each laboratory since there are no commercially available test kits. </p><p>The sensitivity of PCR using specimens collected from mucosal sites via a swab has been compared with darkfield microscopy and clinical diagnostic criteria (including serology). The sensitivity has ranged from approximately 70 to 95 percent and appears to be greater than that seen with darkfield microscopy. The specificity has ranged from 92 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study of 294 patients with suspected syphilis and 35 healthy volunteers, the results of nested PCR testing for <em>T. pallidum</em> from swab-collected specimens were highly concordant with a clinical diagnosis of syphilis based upon United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, with a sensitivity of 82 percent and a specificity of 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from Europe that evaluated patients with presumed syphilis, the diagnostic accuracy of PCR testing was found to be greater than that of darkfield microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Both darkfield microscopy and serologic results were available for 170 patients with a high-risk exposure and genital, anal, or oral ulcers suggestive of syphilis. The sensitivity of PCR testing was 87.5 percent compared with 66.7 percent with darkfield microscopy when a diagnosis of syphilis was made by either a positive darkfield microscopy result or a negative darkfield microscopy result in combination with a positive serologic test, a clinical manifestation, and a drop in nontreponemal titers in response to treatment. </p><p/><p>Improvements in PCR testing resulting from better antigen specificity and the recognized lack of sensitivity of Darkfield microscopy or DFA testing when the number of treponemes is low may explain these results. However, it is important to appreciate that PCR assays amplify both live and dead organisms, a fact that must be accounted for to interpret results accurately.</p><p>PCR tests are <strong>not</strong> suitable for screening asymptomatic individuals, since the sensitivity of PCR testing tends to be much lower in blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens (approximately 24 to 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1818142166\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients, a presumptive diagnosis of syphilis is made through serologic testing of blood specimens.

Confirmatory testing is necessary due to the potential for a false positive screening test result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Screening using an initial treponemal test is favored by many laboratories, especially those that perform relatively high volumes of syphilis testing, since automated treponemal-specific enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA) testing for syphilis is less expensive than the nontreponemal rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. The interpretation of serologic test results is discussed below.

In general, for asymptomatic patients, no further testing is needed if the nontreponemal test is negative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F111448\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111448 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, for patients who present early in the course of disease (eg, ulcer, rash), serologic testing may be negative. If there is a high clinical suspicion for syphilis, repeat serologic testing should be performed in two to four weeks or presumptive treatment should be administered. Although polymerase chain reaction testing of tissue specimens may be of value for the diagnosis of early syphilis, this type of testing is not commonly available.

This approach was first described in 2008 by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although observational studies have reported a higher false positive rate with this reverse screening method compared with the traditional approach described above, it can detect syphilis in some patients with syphilis who would not have been identified if an initial nontreponemal test was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This includes those with very early syphilis, those with prior treated syphilis, and those with late or late latent syphilis whose nontreponemal test has become nonreactive over time. The approach to such patients with discordant results (ie, the treponemal test is reactive but the reflex nontreponemal test is negative) is discussed elsewhere.

As an example, when the reported seroprevalence of syphilis is 0.71 (the prevalence of syphilis in the United States in 2008), the negative predictive value of the treponemal EIA exceeds 98 percent; however, the positive predictive value is as low as 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/14,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33</a>]. When this approach is used to screen higher risk populations (eg, patients seen in HIV or sexually transmitted disease clinics), the positive predictive value can be as high as 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1318538919\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing for neurosyphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of cerebrospinal fluid is the only way to definitively diagnose neurosyphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Elevations of white blood cells and protein in CSF are nonspecific findings, especially in HIV-infected patients.

Although it is less specific than a CSF-VDRL, the CSF FTA-ABS test is quite sensitive, and neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] </p><p>The use of nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) testing of CSF has been evaluated in persons with syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a prospective study of 40 patients with presumed neurosyphilis, nPCR had a sensitivity of 42 percent, as compared with 30 percent for CSF-VDRL. The absence of a &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing neurosyphilis complicates interpretation of these findings as some of the tested patients may not have had neurosyphilis.

Although false positive test results tend to be of low titer, the level of the titer alone does not reliably help the clinician differentiate between a true or false positive result.

Thus, a prozone reaction refers to the inability to visualize agglutination, which normally occurs when antigen and antibody bind together to form a complex. This phenomenon occurs in less than 2 percent of samples from patients with syphilis, and is usually associated with pregnancy, HIV coinfection, and neurosyphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Experienced laboratory technologists may suspect the prozone phenomenon when an apparent nonreactive test exhibits a rough or granular appearance.

(See <a href=\"#H2241357978\" class=\"local\">'Positive nontreponemal/positive treponemal test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have a positive nontreponemal test followed by a negative treponemal test are generally considered to have a false positive syphilis result. It is estimated that 1 to 2 percent of the United States population has false positive nontreponemal test results. (See <a href=\"#H2189329707\" class=\"local\">'Positive nontreponemal/negative treponemal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are tested for syphilis using an initial treponemal-specific screening strategy (&quot;reverse algorithm&quot;) can have a positive treponemal test followed by a negative nontreponemal test. Although this scenario is usually seen in patients with a history of previously treated syphilis, it can occasionally occur in very early syphilis or in late syphilis when nontreponemal tests have become nonreactive over time. (See <a href=\"#H3482561730\" class=\"local\">'Positive treponemal/negative nontreponemal test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H774290909\" class=\"local\">'Negative nontreponemal test in late syphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with clinical signs and symptoms of early syphilis (eg, ulcer, rash) who are tested for syphilis using an initial nontreponemal test may have a false negative result. For such patients, a false negative test is typically due to testing prior to antibody formation or secondary to a prozone effect. (See <a href=\"#H3955025181\" class=\"local\">'Negative nontreponemal test in early syphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latent syphilis is diagnosed in a patient who has no clinical signs or symptoms of syphilis but has serologic evidence of infection. A patient has early or late latent syphilis depending upon the duration of infection. (See <a href=\"#H765195106\" class=\"local\">'Latent syphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge P Frederick Sparling, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ghanem KG, Workowski KA.
