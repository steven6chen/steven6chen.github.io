However, the vast majority eventually develop progressive disease. </p><p>Once disease progresses, men are considered to have castration-resistant disease. A number of new therapies have been shown to prolong survival in this setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>), but there remains a need for additional approaches that can control disease and prolong survival. </p><p>An increasing understanding of the biology of prostate cancer is leading to the development of new therapies that can target specific abnormalities in prostate cancer. Although a number of agents have failed in phase III or randomized phase II trials, other experimental approaches are in advanced stages of development. These are discussed in this topic. The overall approach to men with advanced disease is discussed separately.

However, there have been no prospective interventional studies in which statins were used in prostate cancer patients.</p><p>Although there is conflicting data on whether the use of statins affects the incidence of prostate cancer, the impact of statin use on men with prostate cancer has been consistent in several large studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) identified 2579 cases of prostate cancer, which included 316 with regionally invasive, metastatic, or fatal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There was no association between statin use and the overall risk of prostate cancer (risk ratio [RR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.09). However, multivariate analysis found a significant decrease in the risk of advanced disease after controlling for known risk factors (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.86). Furthermore, the decrease in risk was more pronounced when the duration of statin use was considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 11,772 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1998 and 2009 found that prostate cancer mortality was significantly decreased in those who were using statins after the diagnosis of prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The difference in prostate cancer mortality was more pronounced in those who had also been on statins prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.74). The effect of statins was least pronounced in those who only used statins after the diagnosis of prostate cancer was established (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Danish study of 31,790 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2011 included 7365 men who died of prostate cancer and 11,811 who died from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Use of statins was associated with a significant decrease in both prostate cancer mortality (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.85).</p><p/><p>However, these studies do not establish a causal relationship between statin use and a beneficial impact on the clinical course of prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-prostate-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Additional studies will be required to define the role of these agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of patients who either present with metastatic disease or who relapse after their initial treatment for localized disease uses androgen deprivation therapy as initial therapy. Secondary hormonal therapies and chemotherapy often provide an additional period of disease control. However, most men with metastatic prostate cancer eventually develop castration-resistant disease that cannot be controlled by currently approved modalities.
