Doctors use this imaging test to check for problems in the heart or blood vessels. A Doppler ultrasound can also show how blood flows through the blood vessels.</p><p>There are different ways doctors can do a Doppler ultrasound. One type of Doppler ultrasound is used specifically to check blood flow through blood vessels. It uses color images to show blood flow. Doctors sometimes call this test a &quot;duplex&quot; ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193551626\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order a Doppler ultrasound?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order a Doppler ultrasound to check for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerosis &ndash; In this condition, fatty clumps called &quot;plaques&quot; build up in the arteries and make them narrow or blocked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83222 \">figure 1</a>). Atherosclerosis can happen in different parts of the body, including the carotid arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72617 \">figure 2</a>) or arteries in the legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60105 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A deep vein thrombosis (also called a &quot;DVT&quot;) &ndash; This is when a blood clot forms in a deep vein in the leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70603 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with how the leg veins are working &ndash; If the veins in the legs don't work well, blood can collect in the legs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injury to an artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the heart valves &ndash; To check how well the heart valves are working, doctors can do a Doppler ultrasound as part of another test called an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p>Doctors can also use a Doppler ultrasound to check a baby's heartbeat when it is inside the mother's uterus (womb).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193551641\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for a Doppler ultrasound?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You do not need to do anything special to prepare for this test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193551656\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a Doppler ultrasound?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor, nurse, or technician will put a small amount of gel on the part of your body being checked. Then he or she will press a thick wand, called a &quot;transducer,&quot; against your skin. He or she will move the transducer around on your skin. Images will appear on a computer screen.</p><p>This test does not usually hurt, but people can feel pressure when the transducer presses against their skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193551671\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of a Doppler ultrasound?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Doppler ultrasound does not have any downsides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193551686\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atherosclerosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atherosclerosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-artery-disease-and-claudication-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peripheral artery disease and claudication (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicose-veins-and-other-vein-disease-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Varicose veins and other vein disease in the legs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-artery-disease-and-claudication-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peripheral artery disease and claudication (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-venous-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic venous disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
