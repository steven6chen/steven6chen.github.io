It was given its current name in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and has also been referred to as pseudomigraine with temporary neurologic symptoms and lymphocytic pleocytosis (PMP syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The most frequent neurologic symptoms associated with HaNDL are hemiparesis, hemisensory disturbances, and aphasia. Visual signs and symptoms are less common, but may include decreased vision, homonymous hemianopsia, and photopsias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].

Although HaNDL is usually accompanied by focal deficits, occasional patients have had episodes with more diffuse manifestations such as an acute confusional state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/5,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27-29</a>]. </p><p>Some patients with HaNDL have an elevated CSF opening pressure as described below.

Although HaNDL is considered a monophasic disorder, most patients (approximately 75 percent) have repeated attacks of transient headache and neurologic deficits that occur for weeks or even months following the initial attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The neurologic deficits often vary from one episode to the next, involving different brain regions. In the two largest reports, the mean duration of the illness was 14 and 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].</p><p>The headache of HaNDL is moderate to severe, and is usually throbbing in quality. It may be unilateral or bilateral, and can last from one hour to one week, but typically lasts for hours. Often it is associated with nausea and vomiting, and not infrequently with photophobia.

Given the onset of severe headache and neurologic symptoms, especially in patients lacking a prior history of headache, an extensive work-up is usually prompted at presentation in order to exclude serious conditions such as stroke, other structural brain lesions, meningitis, and seizures. In particular, it is important to rule out treatable entities including Lyme borreliosis, neurosyphilis, human immunodeficiency virus meningitis, encephalitis, and vasculitis of the central nervous system. As an example, in one case report, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis presented with recurrent stereotyped episodes of transient neurologic deficits and severe headache resembling HaNDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, a complete evaluation should be obtained when HaNDL is suspected, including brain MRI, electroencephalography, and angiography. Additional testing for neuronal antibodies is warranted when suspected HaNDL is associated with an acute confusional state or behavioral abnormalities. &#160;</p><p>HaNDL can be distinguished from Mollaret meningitis (also known as recurrent benign lymphocytic meningitis) by the presence of neurologic deficits, the absence of meningismus, and the lack of Mollaret cells in the CSF.

In addition, the CSF opening pressure is often elevated and increased protein is common.

However, education and reassurance about this disorder are important because of the likelihood of further alarming attacks involving transient headache and neurologic deficits that can occur for weeks or even months following the initial attack. These recurrences will almost require emergent evaluation. For patients with a secure diagnosis of HaNDL who present with a characteristic attack within three months of the initial attack, it may be reasonable to limit investigations to a head scan with CT or MRI for each attack and a lumbar puncture for the second attack, though not for subsequent attacks. In the authors&rsquo; clinical experience, these investigations are usually required to reassure the treating physician that the presentation is indeed HaNDL and not a coincident secondary etiology such as infarction or central nervous system infection. However, more extensive repeat testing will likely be needed when the diagnosis of HaNDL is not well-established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267391272\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL) is a self-limited condition. As the name implies, HaNDL is characterized by one or more episodes of severe headache, transient neurologic deficits, and lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (See <a href=\"#H267391202\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise etiology of HaNDL remains elusive. Despite the findings suggestive of a migrainous pathophysiology, HaNDL is still thought to have a viral or inflammatory etiology. (See <a href=\"#H267393098\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most frequent neurologic symptoms associated with HaNDL are hemiparesis, hemisensory disturbances, and aphasia. The headache of HaNDL is moderate to severe, and usually throbbing in quality. Many patients have repeated episodes over the duration of the illness, which typically lasts for two to three weeks after onset, but may continue for up to three months. (See <a href=\"#H343993487\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H267393492\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Though HaNDL is a self-limited syndrome, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out more sinister etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H343993929\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the defining features of HaNDL is a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis. In addition, the CSF opening pressure is often elevated and increased CSF protein is common. (See <a href=\"#H267391237\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Though normal neuroimaging is a criterion for HaNDL, nonspecific abnormalities are occasionally seen on routine head CT or conventional MRI. In the majority of cases, conventional cranial angiography is normal. (See <a href=\"#H267391244\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electroencephalography done during the symptomatic period in HaNDL is usually abnormal; unilateral slowing corresponding to the clinical symptoms is often seen. (See <a href=\"#H267391251\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of HaNDL is established, treatment of the syndrome consists essentially of symptomatic headache management. For patients with a secure diagnosis of HaNDL who present with a characteristic attack within three months of the initial attack, it may be reasonable to limit investigations to a head scan with CT or MRI for each attack and a lumbar puncture for the second attack, though not for subsequent attacks. However, more extensive repeat testing will likely be needed when the diagnosis of HaNDL is not well-established. (See <a href=\"#H267391265\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndrome-of-transient-headache-and-neurologic-deficits-with-cerebrospinal-fluid-lymphocytosis-handl/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bartleson JD, Swanson JW, Whisnant JP.
