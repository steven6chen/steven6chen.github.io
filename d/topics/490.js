Smoking may increase the risk of progression to advanced AMD. Thus, patients with AMD should be particularly encouraged to quit smoking. However, there is no proven effective treatment for dry AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Antioxidants, zinc, and laser therapy have all been tried.</p><p>Patients with dry AMD may develop wet AMD. A population study of patients with dry AMD reported development of wet AMD in 7.1 percent over five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A higher rate of progression (13 to 18 percent at three years) has been reported in patients with bilateral soft drusen, which represents more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Age-related macular degeneration: Clinical presentation, etiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antioxidant vitamins and zinc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon results of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) trial, we suggest treatment with antioxidant vitamins plus zinc for patients with extensive intermediate size drusen, at least one large drusen, or noncentral geographic atrophy in one or both eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The original AREDS formulation contained relatively high doses of vitamins A, C, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> plus zinc. However, beta-carotene has been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. An alternative regimen, in which lutein and zeaxanthin are substituted for beta-carotene, was shown to be equally effective in the subsequent AREDS2 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We now suggest treatment with the AREDS2 formulation, containing lutein and zeaxanthin in lieu of beta-carotene. The original formulation is an acceptable alternative for nonsmokers.</p><p>Antioxidants have been hypothesized to prevent cellular damage in the retina by limiting the effects of free radicals produced in the process of light absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The effects of vitamins C, E, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, and the antioxidant mineral zinc, are variable in patients with AMD, depending upon the severity of disease.</p><p>In the AREDS trial, 3640 subjects (aged 55 to 80 years) were evaluated and designated to be in the following categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category one &ndash; No AMD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category two &ndash; Mild or borderline dry AMD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category three &ndash; Moderate dry AMD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category four &ndash; Advanced dry AMD (geographic atrophy involving the macula) or wet AMD (choroidal neovascularization)</p><p/><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: antioxidants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> 500 mg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> 400 international units, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> 15 mg); zinc (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> 80 mg and cupric oxide 2 mg); antioxidants plus zinc; or placebo. During an average follow-up of 6.3 years, the following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with no AMD (category one) or mild or borderline AMD (category two) did not benefit from antioxidant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> zinc supplementation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zinc plus antioxidants, compared with placebo, lowered the risk for progression to advanced AMD or visual acuity loss in the good eye (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.91) in patients with moderate and advanced AMD (categories three and four). Zinc alone was also associated with a lower risk of progression (OR 0.71, CI 0.52-0.99). Specifically, patients with extensive intermediate size drusen, at least one large druse, or noncentral geographic atrophy in one or both eyes benefited from treatment.</p><p/><p>These findings suggest that patients with more extensive dry AMD may benefit from taking antioxidants and zinc at doses used in the AREDS trial. Eleven patients would need to be treated for seven years to prevent progression in one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in smokers, and high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> supplementation may increase all-cause mortality and risk of heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'Vitamin E'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional antioxidants in coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Heart failure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'All-cause mortality'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer#H21311694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Beta-carotene supplementation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemoprevention-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemoprevention of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A subsequent trial, AREDS2, investigated two issues: whether adding additional antioxidants (the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, and omega-3 fatty acids [docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]) to the AREDS vitamin formulation would further decrease risk of AMD, and whether eliminating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> and lowering the dose of zinc would impact efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The trial found that the addition of lutein, zeaxanthin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> omega-3 fatty acids to the original AREDS regimen did not reduce progression of early nonexudative AMD. A subgroup of patients were secondarily randomized to one of four modified AREDS regimens that included substitution of lutein and zeaxanthin for beta-carotene and a lower zinc dose; these modifications did not affect progression of AMD. Additionally, a systematic review of two randomized trials found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with AMD did not decrease risk of progression to advanced AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Laser therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that patients with dry AMD not be treated with laser therapy outside of clinical trials. Several studies have investigated the efficacy of laser therapy for prevention of progression in people with high-risk drusen. While early randomized trials suggested that laser therapy produced a small improvement in visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], subsequent trials showed increased rates of choroidal neovascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] or no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A systematic review of nine randomized trials found that laser photocoagulation of drusen led to drusen reduction but did not decrease the risk of choroidal neovascularization or loss of vision and did not appear to reduce the development of geographic atrophy acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1590681396\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational stem cell therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective study in nine patients with atrophic AMD (median age 77 years) found that subretinal transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal epithelial cells improved visual acuity at 12 months in the treated eye compared with the untreated eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Systemic immunosuppression was given for 13 weeks, and adverse effects related to immunosuppression and cataracts, although the procedure was generally well-tolerated and patients were followed for up to three years. These findings support a proof-of-concept but are too preliminary to suggest a means of treatment.</p><p>The use of autologous induced stem-cell-derived retinal cells for wet AMD has also been described in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The procedure involved removal of the neovascular membrane and transplantation of cells under the retina. One year after surgery, the transplanted cell sheet was intact, best corrected visual acuity was stable, and cystoid macular edema was present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF WET AMD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective therapies for exudative or wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) include intravitreous injection of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and supplementation with zinc and antioxidant vitamins. The decision about specific therapies must take into account the likelihood of visual recovery, which is better with smaller, more recent lesions, as well as the risks of the various therapies.</p><p>In general, our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with AMD and neovascularization, we recommend treatment with intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a>. PDT is an alternative for patients who cannot be treated with an intravitreal VEGF inhibitor and for patients with chronic exudative lesions who have preserved vision in one eye and are unlikely to achieve reading vision in the second eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We also suggest that patients with wet AMD in one or both eyes be treated with daily oral supplements consistent with the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) formulation (containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> 500 mg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> 400 international units, lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, zinc 80 mg [as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a>], and copper 2 mg [as cupric oxide]). Alternatively, patients who are not smokers or former smokers may use the standard AREDS formulation, which contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> rather than lutein or zeaxanthin.

Intravitreal injection of drugs that inhibit VEGF can limit progression of exudative AMD and stabilize, or reverse, visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Long-term data from randomized trials are available for intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and data are available comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> with ranibizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/26,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28-30</a>]. In a systematic review of 12 randomized trials (5496 participants) evaluating VEGF inhibitors, outcomes for bevacizumab and ranibizumab were similar and both improved visual acuity, as well as morphologic parameters, compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another review concludes that intravitreal injection of ranibizumab every four weeks, bevacizumab (off-label) every four weeks, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a> every eight weeks appear to have similar efficacy in the treatment of wet AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In light of the significant difference in cost between bevacizumab and ranibizumab or aflibercept, off-label use of bevacizumab (requiring dose preparation for intravitreal injection) is increasingly being administered in the United States. An older VEGF inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegaptanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegaptanib</a>, was somewhat less effective than ranibizumab or bevacizumab and is now used infrequently.</p><p>Delay in the initiation of VEGF therapy (greater than 21 weeks compared with less than 7 weeks) after first symptoms of wet AMD has been associated with poorer vision outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Long-term cardiovascular effects of these medications in the treatment of AMD are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
