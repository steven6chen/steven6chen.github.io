Aerodigestive protection involves the coordinated functions of nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, esophagus, and stomach, as well as protecting the supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic tubular airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642496198\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY OF ORAL FEEDING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18739852\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For successful oral feeding, the neonate must be able to extract milk from either the breast or bottle (nutritive sucking), form a bolus of fluid, and transport it safely through the upper digestive tract (swallowing and aerodigestive protection). This requires that sucking and swallowing be fully coordinated with breathing. Disruption of these coordinated functions can result in feeding difficulties leading to increased risk of apnea, bradycardia, failure to thrive, oxygen desaturation, or aspiration.</p><p>In the fetus, swallowing is developed by the end of the first trimester (15 weeks gestation), at which time the fetus is able to swallow amniotic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Infants born at term are able to normally coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. However, for preterm infants, coordination is progressive and oral feedings can be challenging for preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation, as they have not yet developed mature sucking and swallowing capabilities. Typically, nonnutritive sucking can be introduced, usually via a pacifier, at 28 to 29 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Between 32 weeks gestation and term, infants learn to coordinate sucking and swallowing with breathing, and develop adaptive aerodigestive protective mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Sucking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sucking refers to the oromotor phase of the feeding cycle, in which a partial vacuum is produced by the lips and tongue. It can be classified as either nonnutritive or nutritive sucking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18739888\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutritive sucking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritive sucking requires appropriate integration and synchronization of lips, cheeks, tongue, and palatal movements in order to express milk into the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mature nutritive sucking consists of a rhythmic alternation between suction and expression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72871\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72871 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Suction corresponds to the negative intraoral pressure exerted by the infant when milk is drawn into the mouth, which requires the sequential activation of the perioral muscles (temporal, masseter, orbicular, and suprahyoid muscles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Expression corresponds to the positive pressure resulting from mouthing, stripping, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compression of the nipple between the tongue and the hard palate to eject milk from the nipple and requires synchronization of the lingual musculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Mature nutritive sucking is usually fully developed in normal term infants. The postmenstrual age (PMA) at which preterm infants develop mature nutritive sucking and are able to successfully take oral feedings varies and is related to variations in physiologic and pathophysiologic developmental factors that affect the integrative functions of the brain-airway-digestive tract needed for sucking, swallowing, breathing, and their coordination. However, by approximately 33 to 34 weeks PMA, infants begin to display nutritive sucking skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although the sucking pattern in preterm infants appears similar to that of term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>], initial sucking in very preterm infants is characterized by arrhythmic suction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> expression. With maturation, the alternation of suction and expression gains in rhythmicity and amplitude, which leads to more efficient and rapid feeding. Oral feeding performance manifested by the volume transferred improves with maturation as sucking skills mature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nevertheless, the lack of safe nutritive sucking skills due to prematurity is one of the major reasons for neonatal feeding problems.</p><p>Infants with immature sucking that consists only of expression capability may be able to bottle-feed before they can successfully breastfeed because suction is necessary for breastfeeding to draw milk into the mouth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prevent retraction of the teat. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/11,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19-22</a>]. This is not needed for bottle feeding, as milk continuously fills the nipple chamber and the nipple is more rigid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonnutritive sucking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonnutritive sucking occurs when the infant sucks on a pacifier or finger, and <strong>no</strong> milk is transferred. The pattern is similar to nutritive sucking, but sucking and pause bursts are briefer and sucking frequency is faster (2 versus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">sucks/second,</span> respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101837\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101837 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although nonnutritive sucking matures earlier than nutritive sucking, it is not a good indicator of an infant's ability to feed orally because swallowing and laryngeal closure are minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>].</p><p>Nonnutritive sucking reduces stress, and promotes weight gain and gastrointestinal maturation and growth. However, it has not been shown to increase the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin, motilin, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/24-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-31</a>].</p><p>In preterm infants, nonnutritive sucking prior to nipple feeding appears to enhance the transition from tube to oral feeding, possibly by affecting the infant's behavioral state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In a prospective observational study, premature infants born between 25 and 35 weeks gestation with a more organized nonnutritive sucking pattern reached independent oral feeding earlier than those with a more chaotic pattern of sucking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In an evaluation of preterm infants (gestational age from 28 to 34 weeks), basal upper esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter pressures decreased with non-nutritive stimulation (pacifier use with and without sucrose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], but there was no effect on esophageal motility, bolus transit, or airway interactions. Central parasympathetic-cholinergic excitatory drive is likely decreased with pacifier use, but had no effect on sucking-swallowing-esophageal motility coordination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swallowing is composed of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. During the oral phase, the bolus is formed in the oral cavity; in the pharyngeal phase, the bolus is transported through the upper pharynx and into the esophagus by pharyngeal peristalsis; and in the esophageal phase, peristaltic contractions of the esophagus propel the bolus through the distal esophagus and into the stomach. Safe swallowing involves the coordinated contraction of the pharynx, relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), and protective movement of oropharyngeal structures (aerodigestive protection) to prevent reflux into the nasopharynx and airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72871\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72871 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-etiology-and-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Physiology of swallowing'</a>.)</p><p>A reported difference in swallowing between infants and more mature individuals includes the need for an external input, such as a milk bolus, to stimulate the swallowing center of infants, which is not needed in older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The observation that swallowing is minimal during nonnutritive sucking, when no liquid is transferred, supports the need for external stimuli in neonates. The frequency of swallowing in infants may also be dependent upon the nature of the stimuli with different swallowing responses, as reported by one study in neonates that found different response rates of swallowing to air or sterile water infusions measured by pharyngeal and upper esophageal manometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275188374\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal esophageal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important function of the esophagus is to transport boluses of food and liquid to the downstream digestive and absorptive organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Esophageal function begins in the fetus as the primitive esophagus transports swallowed amniotic fluid into the stomach. This is referred to as deglutitive pharyngo-esophageal peristaltic reflex. It results in the coordinated sequential esophageal body peristalsis, and relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) followed by restoration of LES tone by coordinating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p>Esophageal peristalsis can be classified into primary and secondary peristalsis, which together contribute to the propulsion of the bolus during swallowing, and also during gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Primary peristalsis or deglutition response is triggered in the pharyngeal phase of swallow, propagates distally into the stomach, and is normally associated with a respiratory pause called deglutition apnea. Secondary peristalsis is a swallow-independent sequence and is triggered by esophageal provocation. It can occur due to esophageal distention, chemosensitive stimulation, or osmosensitive stimulation of the esophagus.</p><p>In premature infants, pharyngeal-upper esophageal sphincter coordination with respiration is one of the cardinal factors for feeding-related symptoms and dysfunctional feeding behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/36,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275188650\"><span class=\"h3\">Aerodigestive protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aerodigestive protection prevents reflux of material during swallowing that could injure the esophagus or the airways.

In addition, there is evidence that some infants born prematurely may develop inappropriate patterns of esophageal motility, which delay their ability to successfully oral feed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Infants less than 32 weeks PMA are not developmentally mature enough to have developed nutritive sucking, a prerequisite for successful oral feeding (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sucking'</a> above). In addition, infants who are medically unstable (eg, those requiring mechanical ventilation) are not candidates for oral feeding as they cannot protect their airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral readiness criteria include medical stability (eg, no evidence of respiratory distress or cardiovascular instability), &gt;33 to 34 weeks PMA, adequate level of arousal, and the presence of a nonnutritive sucking pattern (positive pressure of the mandible and tongue on the pacifier) and suction (negative pressure in the oral cavity generated by movement of the mandible in an inferior-anterior trajectory).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal feeding assessment &minus; Once the infant demonstrates prefeeding developmental milestones, the provision of oral feeds, as well as the ongoing clinical oral feeding assessment, can be initiated. The assessment of bottle-feeding performance requires the clinical evaluation of an infant's isolated sucking, swallowing, and respiratory function, as well as the infant's ability to integrate these functions for successful oral intake. Although the methods of assessment may vary depending on feeding modality, neonatal feeding assessment can be conducted on infants during both breast and bottle-feeding. Assessment should be performed by an experienced clinician (eg, occupational and speech therapists).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nutritive sucking &ndash; As in the assessment of nonnutritive sucking, the assessment of nutritive sucking can be conducted using subjective or objective modalities. Both subjective and objective nutritive sucking assessments aim to identify the magnitude and temporal characteristics of sucking physiology, as well as the resulting volume and rate of milk ingestion, although the validity of subjective assessment methods in defining these functions has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pharyngeal swallowing &ndash; While the objective assessment of the pharyngeal swallow can be conducted using a variety of methods described below, the assessment of neonatal swallowing physiology should always be initiated in the clinical environment, with results serving to guide the timing and necessity of further, more invasive assessment modalities. The clinical assessment of pharyngeal swallowing serves to identify the infant's adequacy of airway protection during the pharyngeal swallow, as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> ability to efficiently clear the bolus from <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> pharynx once the pharyngeal swallow has been completed. Although only objective swallow assessments such as the videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) and the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallow (FEES) enable the visualization of both physiology and bolus flow, observations made during subjective clinical assessments provide insight into the presence and nature of physiologic deficits that warrant further objective evaluation. Clinical observations that may be indicative of an impairment requiring further objective evaluation include delayed or absent pharyngeal swallow, reduced movement of the hyolaryngeal complex, multiple swallows per bolus, coughing or choking during feeds, eye tearing, and reductions in cardiopulmonary stability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sucking, swallowing, and respiratory coordination &ndash; The time-linked coordination between the physiologic processes of sucking, swallowing, and respiration is equally as important to the infant's ability to successfully oral feed. As is commonly observed in the preterm infant, failure to interject respiration between sequential swallows inhibits the infant's ability to meet nutritional needs while maintaining cardiopulmonary stability. Clinical assessment of this coordination relies largely on the subjective assessment of respiratory rhythmicity and stability during suck-bursts and suck-burst breaks. Other, more refined assessments of this coordination include the evaluation of respiratory mechanics, for observations of paradoxical respiratory movements during suck-bursts, as well as the evaluation of upper airway patency, for observations of stridor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18741440\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonintensive care setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For infants who are not cared for in the NICU, the assessment is usually based on direct observation of feeding that includes the evaluation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">sucking/swallowing/breathing</span> pattern, efficiency, and endurance during feeding.

VFSS is indicated if there is a need to observe the patient's swallowing biomechanics because of the presence of a respiratory disorder thought to be due to aspiration, persistent feeding refusal, or a suspected anatomic or functional defect of the oral, pharyngeal, or upper esophagus based on initial evaluation, or as a tool to guide management decisions and feeding strategies.</p><p>The VFSS allows for the fluoroscopic evaluation of the integrity of oropharyngeal physiologic processes during oral intake, the effect of these processes on bolus flow, and their response to treatment during the intake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast. In addition to assessing the integrity of oropharyngeal muscular and structural movements, the VFSS also provides the clinician information on the temporal integrity of these reflexes, and the result of physiologic impairments on bolus flow. Insufficient contraction of the oropharyngeal structures can result in laryngeal penetration, defined as the passage of the bolus to the level of the vocal folds, laryngeal aspiration, defined as the passage of the bolus below the level of the vocal folds, or pharyngeal residue, which can then be aspirated upon inspiration following the swallow. When deficits are observed, the VFSS enables the evaluation of treatment effect in the improvement of oropharyngeal swallow function through the provision of compensatory feeding strategies. Commonly used compensatory feeding strategies include the alteration of nipple type, bolus viscosity, infant position, and feeding method.</p><p>Of note, the use of VFSS <strong>alone </strong>may result in delayed initiation and presentation of appropriate oromotor sensory stimuli, which may lead to behavioral feeding disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

It consists of a rhythmic alternation between suction and expression that requires appropriate integration and synchronization of lips, cheeks, tongue, and palatal movements. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sucking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swallowing involves the coordinated movement of producing a bolus of fluid (human milk or formula) and moving it from the oral cavity through the contracted pharynx, across the relaxed upper esophageal sphincter (UES), and into the distal esophagus and stomach. Safe swallowing involves the coordinated contraction of the pharynx, relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter, and aerodigestive protective mechanisms that prevent reflux into the nasopharynx and airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72871\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72871 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Swallowing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main causes of sucking and swallowing disorders that result in neonatal feeding problems include anatomical defects (eg, cleft lip or palate), functional abnormalities of the pharynx or esophagus (eg, dysmotility or obstruction due to external compression), neurologic disorders (eg, congenital brainstem lesions or neuromuscular junction disorders), and prematurity. (See <a href=\"#H18740620\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of neonatal sucking and swallowing disorders ranges from serious events, such as aspiration events or an apparent life-threatening event, to more subtle and nonspecific findings including feeding difficulties and poor weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H18740997\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the diagnostic evaluation is to determine the underlying etiology. It includes an initial assessment based on history, physical examination, and observation of the infant while feeding. The need and choice for further diagnostic evaluation are guided by the results of the initial assessment or clinical setting. Further diagnostic tests include videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), reflux monitoring tests, and esophageal motility tests (manometry). (See <a href=\"#H233305710\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of neonates with sucking and swallowing dysfunction is optimally coordinated through a multidisciplinary team. The focus of the treatment plan is to identify underlying causes that are correctable (eg, cleft lip or palate), optimize feeding by promoting oral motor skills (eg, preterm infants), and if necessary, provide supplemental nutrition via alternative feeding strategies to ensure adequate growth (eg, gastrostomy tube in infants with intractable neuromuscular disorders). (See <a href=\"#H233306180\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642495278\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Chantal Lau, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wolff PH.
