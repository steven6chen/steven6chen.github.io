Some of these problems are discussed in detail elsewhere within UpToDate, but will be briefly reviewed here.</p><p>The importance of these complications was highlighted in a study of death within 60 days of diagnosis in patients with myeloma entering onto the United Kingdom's Medical Research Council (MRC) trials. The incidence of early death was 10 percent, with the most common contributors being bacterial infection (50 percent) and renal failure (28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Treatment of the complications of multiple myeloma will be reviewed here. The uses of chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation in the treatment of multiple myeloma are discussed separately, as is the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.

Patients with hypercalcemia may be asymptomatic or complain of a variety of symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, increased constipation, weakness, confusion, or stupor. Hypercalcemia can also contribute to the development of renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Hypercalcemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most patients with myeloma the diagnosis of hypercalcemia does not require measurement of the ionized calcium. However, if a patient presents with an elevated serum calcium level but no associated symptoms, the ionized calcium should be measured to confirm hypercalcemia prior to the initiation of treatment since rarely the monoclonal protein binds to calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The treatment of hypercalcemia depends upon the calcium level, the rapidity with which it developed, and the patient's symptoms. In general, the following approach may be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydration, preferably with isotonic saline, plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> as part of myeloma therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) is effective in most cases of mild hypercalcemia (eg, serum calcium &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In moderate to severe hypercalcemia (eg, serum calcium &gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> treatment includes hydration, corticosteroids, and a bisphosphonate such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcitonin</a> is used if rapid reduction of calcium levels is needed or if patients are refractory to bisphosphonates alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremely severe hypercalcemia (eg, &gt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> may require hemodialysis in addition to the measures outlined above.</p><p/><p>Typically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> is administered intravenously at a dose of 4 mg over 15 minutes, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> is given intravenously at a dose of 60 to 90 mg over at least two hours. The dose of zoledronic acid needs to be reduced in patients with renal failure. In patients who present with acute and severe renal failure, pamidronate is preferable since the dosing of zoledronic acid may be difficult to determine in the acute setting. Further details regarding the treatment of hypercalcemia are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL INSUFFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal insufficiency, which can be acute or insidious in onset, occurs in approximately one-half of patients with multiple myeloma. A variety of etiologic mechanisms may be involved, including those related to the excess production of monoclonal light chains (light-chain cast nephropathy), deposition of intact light chains causing nephrotic syndrome (light chain deposition disease), light chain amyloidosis, hypercalcemia, radiocontrast media-induced acute renal failure (usually due to dehydration in the presence of Bence Jones proteinuria) and, infrequently, hyperuricemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiology of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All patients with multiple myeloma, especially those with large amounts of urinary free light chain excretion, should take measures to minimize renal damage. These include the avoidance of nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides and NSAIDs and the maintenance of hydration by drinking enough fluids to produce 3 liters of <span class=\"nowrap\">urine/day</span>. Certain medications frequently used for the treatment of multiple myeloma or its complications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>) may require dose adjustment for renal insufficiency or may contribute to renal failure. The treatment of renal insufficiency is directed at the underlying cause, and is discussed elsewhere as is the use of plasmapheresis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodialysis in the setting of acute renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiology of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of acute renal failure due to light-chain cast nephropathy may also have impact on the choice of initial induction therapy. A dexamethasone-containing triplet regimen, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (VCD) or bortezomib, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> plus dexamethasone (VTD) may be preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. VCD and VTD do not need dose reductions for renal failure; weekly doses of the drugs used in these regimens can be adjusted based on counts and other adverse effects. Usually, renal function improves with therapy. Even if it does not, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation can be performed, but at greater morbidity and mortality in patients with renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Renal function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with myeloma are at increased risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The rate of infections is highest in the first three to four months of induction therapy and in the setting of relapsed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Factors that contribute to the increased risk of infection include impaired lymphocyte function, suppression of normal plasma cell function, hypogammaglobulinemia, and chemotherapy induced neutropenia. Pneumonias and urinary tract infections account for the majority infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Escherichia coli being the most common organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventative measures that may decrease the rate of infection among patients with myeloma include the use of vaccines, prophylactic antibiotics or antivirals, and intravenous immunoglobulin.</p><p>Patients with myeloma should have yearly influenza vaccines and a single pneumococcal vaccine at the time of diagnosis. Although the antibody response is reduced in many myeloma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>], an individual may mount a suboptimal response and still obtain a benefit. Furthermore, there is no evidence that influenza or pneumococcal vaccination is associated with a higher risk of reaction compared to a normal population. Antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination may be suboptimal and prolonged penicillin prophylaxis for pneumococcus should be administered if recurrent pneumococcal infections occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. A prospective study of the value of antimicrobial prophylaxis has completed accrual and results are pending. In clinical practice, we administer routine antibiotic prophylaxis with either a fluoroquinolone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> 500 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">80/400</span> mg once daily or <span class=\"nowrap\">160/400</span> mg every other day) during the first three to four months of chemotherapy. In general, TMP-SMX should be avoided in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> therapy due to increased risk of serious skin toxicity; in these patients a fluoroquinolone is preferable. In addition, for all patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, we administer antiviral prophylaxis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> 400 mg twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 500 mg once daily) because of the increased risk of herpes zoster (varicella zoster reactivation) with this agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Bortezomib'</a>.)</p><p>The decision to administer prophylactic antibiotics at least in the first few months of initial therapy is based upon the high risk of infections in this setting, as well as the results of a small prospective, randomized trial of 54 patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma randomly assigned to treatment with TMP-SMX <span class=\"nowrap\">(160/800</span> mg PO BID) or placebo for the first two months of induction chemotherapy, which typically included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When compared with patients who were assigned to observation, patients assigned to <span class=\"nowrap\">TMP/SMX</span> had significantly fewer bacterial infections (11 versus 2 patients) and severe infections (8 versus 1 patient) in the first three months. The need for prophylactic antibiotics in the setting of other myeloma therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) is less clear.</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IGIV, IVIG) may be helpful in selected patients who have recurrent, serious infections despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics.

As an example, a phase III trial of 1776 patients with metastatic bone lesions due to multiple myeloma or non-breast, non-prostate solid tumors randomly assigned therapy to denosumab or zoledronic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Denosumab and zoledronic acid resulted in similar times to first on-study skeletal-related event and similar survival rates for the group as a whole. However, a post-hoc subset analysis of the 180 patients with multiple myeloma noted higher mortality among those assigned to denosumab therapy (Hazard ratio 2.26; 95% CI 1.13 to 4.50). The suggestion of inferior survival among patients with multiple myeloma treated with denosumab led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve the use of denosumab in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, but not multiple myeloma.

Extensive radiation should be avoided because it can reduce bone marrow reserve, compromise future chemotherapy, and may prevent a future autologous stem cell procedure. Most patients can get equally rapid pain relief and reduction in tumor mass with systemic therapy for myeloma. The dose of radiation used varies according to the clinical situation. Palliation of lytic bone lesions may be accomplished with 20 to 30 Gy administered in 5 to 10 fractions while higher doses are required for the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma (in which the intent is curative) or spinal cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
