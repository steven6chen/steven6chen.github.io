This topic review will summarize indications for ERCP in children with biliary diseases, focusing on some of the more common disorders. Most of these disorders are discussed in further detail in their corresponding topic reviews. The technical aspects of performing ERCP in children, including complications, and for the use of ERCP for pancreatic disorders, are presented separately.

With the advent of new diagnostic imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), ERCP is evolving into a predominantly therapeutic procedure. The usefulness and safety of ERCP in the pediatric age group depends in large part on the experience of the endoscopist. If the necessary experience and equipment are available at an institution, the following are appropriate biliary indications for ERCP:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12866817\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic indications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal cholestasis (for biliary cysts; and at some institutions as part of the evaluation for suspected biliary atresia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigation of inconclusive abnormal findings on other examinations (eg, MRCP or CT scan)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12866824\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic indications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary obstruction (eg, due to known or suspected choledocholithiasis, bile plug syndrome, parasitic infestation, biliary strictures, or primary sclerosing cholangitis) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary obstruction or leaks after liver transplant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy</p><p/><p>The following techniques can be used during therapeutic ERCP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphincterotomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphincteroplasty (balloon dilation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stone extraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stricture dilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stent placement</p><p/><p>Considerations relevant to specific disorders for which ERCP may be indicated, including alternate approaches to the evaluation if ERCP is not available, are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL CHOLESTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal cholestasis is defined as conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that occurs in the newborn period. It results from diminished bile flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excretion. Although it can be caused by a large number of disorders, relatively few diagnoses account for the majority of defined cases. Biliary atresia, which typically occurs in term infants, accounts for about 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Biliary atresia is characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts leading to progressive obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary tract. As diagnostic techniques improve, specific entities that result in a pathologic picture of neonatal hepatitis have been identified. As an example, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, now recognized as a distinct condition, was formally included in the broad category of neonatal hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of an infant with neonatal cholestasis should be undertaken in a staged approach (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to evaluation of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial step is rapid diagnosis and early initiation of therapy of treatable disorders. Conditions such as sepsis, hypothyroidism, panhypopituitarism, and inborn errors of metabolism (eg, galactosemia) must be recognized and treated promptly to avoid progression of the illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrahepatic biliary atresia must be promptly diagnosed or excluded. Infants should be evaluated as rapidly as possible because the success of the surgical intervention (Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy) diminishes progressively with older age at surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15737325\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of biliary atresia is made with a series of imaging and laboratory tests and liver biopsy to exclude other causes of cholestasis. The definitive diagnosis is made by performing a cholangiogram. This is typically performed intraoperatively (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia#H15007525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;, section on 'Cholangiogram'</a>). However, imaging of the biliary system with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an alternative approach at centers where the necessary expertise and equipment are available. ERCP should be considered when anatomical information from less-invasive imaging modalities is insufficient, and if experienced ERCP practitioners are available to perform the procedure without delay. Multiple reports have demonstrated that ERCP can distinguish biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis in most patients and thus, assists in avoiding unnecessary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/3-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-12</a>]. In one report of 140 infants with suspected biliary atresia, ERCP was successfully performed in 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If the ERCP findings were compatible with biliary atresia, subsequent intraoperative cholangiogram confirmed biliary atresia in approximately 80 percent. In another series, ERCP was 86 percent sensitive and 94 percent specific for detecting biliary atresia, and 100 percent sensitive and 90 percent specific for detecting choledochal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Biliary atresia was classified by Kasai into three main types depending on the level of biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In Kasai type I the common bile duct is obliterated. In Kasai type IIa, the common hepatic duct is obliterated; in type IIb, there is atresia of the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and cystic duct. In Kasai type III, the entire extrahepatic biliary tree is obstructed. Kasai types I, IIb, and III are indistinguishable based on ERCP findings because the obstructed common bile duct prevents visualization of the remainder of the biliary tree. </p><p>A separate classification is used to describe ERCP findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51768\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51768 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERCP type 1 &ndash; nonvisualization of the biliary tree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63360\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63360 \">image 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERCP type 2 &ndash; visualization of the distal common duct and gallbladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76215\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76215 \">image 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERCP type 3 &ndash; visualization of the gallbladder and the complete common duct, with both hepatic ducts or visualization of biliary lakes at the porta hepatis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54117\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54117 \">image 3</a>) </p><p/><p>Successful evaluation of the biliary tree by ERCP depends upon the experience of the endoscopist. In particular, the endoscopist must have confidence that nonvisualization of the common bile duct was not related to technical problems, such as positioning of the catheter. When a skilled endoscopist is available, ERCP may be considered as a first-line test in distinguishing between intra- and extra-hepatic biliary obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Alagille syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alagille syndrome is characterized by the paucity of interlobular bile ducts and the following associated features (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic cholestasis (91 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac anomalies, most commonly peripheral pulmonic stenosis (85 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Butterfly vertebrae (87 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior embryotoxon (prominent Schwalbe line) of the eye (88 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysmorphic facies, consisting of broad nasal bridge, triangular facies, and deep-set eyes (95 percent)</p><p/><p>ERCP generally is not performed as part of the evaluation for Alagille syndrome, although the diagnosis may be suggested in children undergoing ERCP for evaluation of neonatal cholestasis. In children with Alagille syndrome, the ERCP typically shows normal extrahepatic ducts (although hypoplasia is also reported). In contrast, the intrahepatic ducts are diffusely narrowed and demonstrate reduced arborization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Caroli disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caroli disease is a congenital disorder characterized by multifocal, segmental dilatation of large intrahepatic bile ducts. The condition usually is associated with renal cystic disease of varying severity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caroli-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caroli disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Caroli initially described two variants, which has led to some confusion in terminology.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caroli disease is the less common form and is characterized by bile ductular ectasia without other apparent hepatic abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The more common variant is Caroli syndrome, in which bile duct dilatation is associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis.</p><p/><p>The diagnosis is established by imaging studies that demonstrate bile duct ectasia and irregular, cystic dilation of the large proximal intrahepatic bile ducts with a normal common bile duct. These findings can be seen readily with ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiography, or ERCP. Because ERCP is the most invasive of these tests, it is generally not required for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">BILIARY CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary cysts are cystic dilatations, which may occur singly or in multiples throughout the bile ducts. They originally were termed choledochal cysts (involving the extrahepatic bile duct), but the clinical classification was revised in 1977 to include intrahepatic cysts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary cysts&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Several theories of biliary cyst formation have been proposed, and it seems likely that no one mechanism accounts for all biliary cysts. Cysts may be congenital or acquired and have been associated with a variety of anatomic abnormalities. Familial occurrence of cysts has been described. The increased incidence in some Asian countries suggests a genetic or environmental predisposition.</p><p>The diagnosis of biliary cysts can be made by abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used as a supplementary test to confirm the diagnosis and categorize the type of cyst to facilitate surgical planning. The classification scheme defines five types of biliary cyst, of which type I is the most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80937 \">figure 2</a>). The cysts may be fusiform (spindle-like, ie, wider in the middle and tapering towards the ends), or cystic (spherical). A type III cyst is a cystic dilation of the distal common bile duct, which may protrude into the duodenum and is also known as a choledochocele. An overall approach is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary cysts&quot;</a>); a few technical points that are particularly relevant in children are discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6402731\"><span class=\"h2\">Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ, also known as anomalous junction of the pancreatic and biliary ducts [AJPBD] or anomalous pancreaticobiliary union [APBU]) can be demonstrated in virtually all patients with type 1 biliary cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80937 \">figure 2</a>). It is characterized by a junction of the bile duct and pancreatic duct outside the duodenal wall with a long common duct channel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51092 \">figure 3</a>). In children, the maximum length of the common channel in healthy neonates and infants younger than one year is 3 mm. It increases with age to a maximum of 5 mm in children and adolescents between 13 and 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

ERCP is particularly helpful in the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis (to exclude or support a diagnosis of biliary atresia) and a variety of other causes of biliary obstruction including choledocholithiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64323\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64323 \">table 1</a>). Therapeutic maneuvers that can be accomplished during ERCP include sphincterotomy, sphincteroplasty (balloon dilation), extraction of stones from the biliary tree, stricture dilation, and stent placement. (See <a href=\"#H16613333\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with suspected biliary atresia are evaluated with a series of imaging and laboratory tests and liver biopsy to exclude other causes of cholestasis. A cholangiogram is the final step in the diagnostic process. This is done by intraoperative cholangiogram at many centers, but ERCP is a reasonable alternative at centers in which special expertise and equipment are available. Nonvisualization of the common bile duct is highly suggestive of biliary atresia, provided that this was not caused by technical problems, such as positioning of the catheter. Findings consistent with biliary atresia should be followed by surgical exploration for presumed hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure). (See <a href=\"#H15737325\" class=\"local\">'Biliary atresia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERCP is generally not needed for the diagnosis of other causes of neonatal cholestasis, including Alagille syndrome and Caroli disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Alagille syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Caroli disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary cysts are cystic dilatations, which may occur singly or in multiples throughout the bile ducts. The diagnosis can be made by abdominal ultrasound, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). ERCP confirms the diagnosis and categorizes the type of cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80937 \">figure 2</a>) to facilitate surgical planning. An anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) is present in about 70 percent of patients with biliary cysts. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Biliary cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sclerosing cholangitis in children typically is associated with an underlying disorder, including histiocytosis X, immune deficiency states, reticular cell sarcoma, or sickle cell anemia. At least 80 percent of children with primary sclerosing cholangitis have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis can be established by ERCP or MRCP. Patients with symptomatic dominant ductal strictures are candidates for endoscopic treatment to relieve the obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sclerosing cholangitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERCP is indicated for relief of biliary obstruction by ascariasis and other parasites, and is used in combination with anthelminthic therapy to eradicate the remaining worms. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ascariasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among infants and children with choledocholithiasis, about half of affected patients have underlying risk factors, which include hemolytic disease (eg, sickle cell disease), chronic liver disease (eg, intestinal failure-associated liver disease), cardiac surgery, or biliary tract malformations. The role of therapeutic ERCP for choledocholithiasis in children has not been fully established. Infants and children who are asymptomatic but have small common bile duct stones can be managed conservatively. We suggest sphincterotomy and stone removal for symptomatic patients or those with underlying lithogenic disorders (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Choledocholithiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile duct complications are common after liver transplantation. These include bile duct strictures, leaks, and stones, and may occur either early (within four weeks) or late after transplantation. Most patients are initially evaluated with MRCP.
