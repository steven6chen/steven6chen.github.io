In addition to a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, the characteristic electrocardiographic feature is variability in P wave morphology, with each unique P wave morphology felt to indicate a different site of atrial origin. Although this abnormality had been noted for many years during some types of atrial tachycardia, the term MAT became commonplace terminology in the late 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with multiple P wave morphologies but a normal heart rate (60 to 100 beats per minute) are considered to have a wandering atrial pacemaker, since the heart rate does not meet criteria for a tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will review the definition, pathogenesis, etiology, and treatment of MAT in adults. Other tachycardias of atrial origin, as well as the discussion of this arrhythmia in children, are reviewed separately.

To distinguish MAT from other tachyarrhythmias of atrial origin, there should be organized atrial activity yielding P waves with three or more different morphologies. (See <a href=\"#H23844503\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of authors have used the term &quot;chaotic&quot; to describe MAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, chaos in modern usage in nonlinear dynamics and mathematics implies there is order in what appear to be random events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A more accurate term for this arrhythmia is probably &quot;multiform&quot; as there is no proof that the arrhythmia is actually multifocal, although multifocal remains the commonly used term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The tachycardic threshold for multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) has traditionally been set at 100 bpm, but a review of 60 patients with multifocal atrial arrhythmias found a stronger association between the incidence of COPD exacerbations and the diagnosis of MAT if a threshold of 90 bpm was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Some patients have similar electrocardiographic (ECG) findings with multiple P wave morphologies but do not meet criteria for tachycardia. The arrhythmia is called a multifocal atrial rhythm or wandering atrial pacemaker if the rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. A distinction has been made between the two based on the clinical picture, with a wandering atrial pacemaker usually occurring in the asymptomatic or less ill individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changing morphology of the P waves and the variable PR interval suggests that the atrial pacemaker activity arises from different atrial locations. However, the variable PR interval is probably more likely a result of the variable atrial rate. Alternatively, a single focus with different exit pathways or abnormalities in intraatrial conduction could produce the identical electrocardiographic findings. There have only been a few invasive electrophysiologic investigations of MAT, but one study did show abnormal intraatrial, atrionodal, and atrioventricular nodal conduction in many individuals with MAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One case report demonstrated origin of multiform atrial premature complexes from adjacent areas in the right pulmonary veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, this patient did not have the typical setting in which MAT is seen.</p><p>Automaticity refers to normal, accelerated normal, or abnormal pacemaker activity. Triggered activity, on the other hand, results from a normal stimulus giving rise to afterdepolarization, which, if threshold is attained, can result in regenerative action potentials (resulting in tachycardia) in any cardiac tissue. Reentry refers to a circuit in which previously excited tissue is re-excited, producing an extra beat or a sustained rhythm. The occasional responsiveness of MAT to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> suggests intracellular calcium overload causing afterdepolarizations leading to triggered activity as the underlying mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>It is thought that MAT results from right atrial hypertension and distension, either from secondary pulmonary hypertension from advanced COPD or left ventricular dysfunction caused by comorbid processes such as coronary heart disease, systemic hypertension, or aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, although frequently associated with exacerbations of pulmonary disease, MAT may occur in other circumstances, so atrial distension may not be a universal mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAT (and wandering atrial pacemaker) is commonly accompanied by atrial premature beats and can itself be considered a prolonged sequence of atrial premature beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of episodes of MAT are self-limited and non-sustained.</p><p>MAT may be associated with or precede atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].

The average age is approximately 70 years.

Patients have an irregular heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute. The arrhythmia is usually recognized only by ECG monitoring, as the majority of patients are acutely ill and on continuous ECG monitoring. Patients rarely present with symptoms such as palpitations. Presyncope or syncope is generally not associated with this arrhythmia. Given that the majority of patients with MAT are concurrently affected by advanced or decompensated pulmonary disease, many patients have typical symptoms related to the underlying lung disease (eg, shortness of breath, wheezing, productive cough, etc) or acute metabolic derangements.</p><p>Most episodes of MAT do not precipitate hemodynamic compromise or limiting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, higher heart rates associated with MAT can sometimes worsen systemic oxygenation in patients with advanced pulmonary disease. Additionally, in patients with coexistent advanced cardiac disease, namely those with severe multivessel obstructive coronary artery disease or decompensated heart failure, the faster heart rates associated with MAT can exacerbate heart disease, leading to signs and symptoms of cardiac decompensation (eg, angina, dyspnea, orthopnea). Symptomatic decompensation of underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease is an indication for pharmacologic therapy aimed specifically at the tachycardia rather than therapy to control the underlying disease process.

Ten mg is typically sufficient, but if the response to the initial doses is inadequate and if verapamil has been well tolerated, one to two additional 5 mg doses over 5 minutes at 10-minute intervals can be administered if needed.

This procedure should rarely be required, because the vast majority of MAT episodes are brief and because the arrhythmia resolves with correction of the underlying abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. To re-emphasize this, AV junction ablation resulting in creation of complete heart block necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation should not be performed for the purpose of making the ECG appear more normal. It should only be performed in order to improve cardiopulmonary function after proving that the arrhythmia is actually the cause of hemodynamic compromise.</p><p>Since most of the manifestations associated with MAT are due to the rapid ventricular rate, an alternative approach for rate control is radiofrequency modification of the AV junction, similar to the approach taken for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Ablation to cure MAT is rarely indicated and not likely to be effective given the underlying diffuse atrial abnormalities. Early data concerning radiofrequency modification of the AV node were encouraging, but modification of AV transmission without producing complete heart block is unreliable and rarely long-lasting.</p><p>AV node modification with ablation was evaluated in one study of 13 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and medically refractory MAT who underwent AV junctional modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This procedure resulted in adequate control of the ventricular response rate in 84 percent of patients, and the rate was reduced from an average of 145 to 89 beats per minute. One patient developed complete heart block, and one patient had recurrent symptomatic MAT, requiring a second procedure. After a six-month follow-up, all patients with successful modification had an improved quality of life, a reduction in symptoms, and an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction.

In addition to a heart rate &gt;100 beats per minute, the characteristic electrocardiographic feature in MAT is variability in P wave morphology, with three or more distinct P wave morphologies. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients have similar electrocardiographic (ECG) findings with multiple P wave morphologies but do not meet criteria for tachycardia. The arrhythmia is called a multifocal atrial rhythm or wandering atrial pacemaker if the rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MAT is associated with significant lung disease in roughly 60 percent of cases and is identified in up to 20 percent of patients hospitalized for acute respiratory failure. MAT can also occur in the presence of coronary, valvular, hypertensive and other types of heart disease, particularly when associated with heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underlying lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H23843900\" class=\"local\">'Associated clinical conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, the clinical manifestations of MAT differ from those of other tachyarrhythmias in that symptoms predominantly relate to the underlying precipitating illness rather than the arrhythmia. Patients have an irregular heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, usually identified only during the physical exam by the health care provider, and they rarely present with symptoms of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope as the sole manifestation of MAT. (See <a href=\"#H23844503\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MAT can be suspected from the presence of an irregular rapid pulse and heartbeat on physical examination; however, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed without an ECG.

Options for medical therapy for patients with symptomatic MAT requiring ventricular rate control include non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.
