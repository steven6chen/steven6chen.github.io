Individuals who underwent colonoscopy on an average of every three years had a lower CRC incidence (6 versus 16 percent) and overall mortality (8 versus 22 percent) as compared with the unscreened group.

A placebo-controlled trial (CAPP2) that included 937 patients with Lynch syndrome found that neither aspirin nor resistant starch provided a benefit for adenoma or CRC prevention after a mean of 29 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-screening-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, a subsequent analysis of 861 patients followed for 56 months found a marginally significant reduction in CRC incidence in the subset of patients treated with 600 mg aspirin per day for more than two years and a secondary analysis found a decreased rate of overall Lynch cancers in the aspirin-treated group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-screening-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Lynch syndrome is characterized by an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Individuals with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of extracolonic malignancies, the most common of which is endometrial cancer. Other sites of cancer include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, renal pelvis, and ureter, brain, and skin. There may also be an increased risk of breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H26371113\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with Lynch syndrome should undergo screening for CRC and extracolonic cancers. We suggest the following approach (see <a href=\"#H21758702\" class=\"local\">'Cancer screening'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Annual colonoscopy starting between the ages of 20 and 25 years, or two to five years prior to the earliest age of CRC diagnosis in the family, whichever comes first. In families with <em>MSH6</em> or <em>PMS2</em> mutations, screening can start at age 25 to 30 or two to five years prior to the earliest CRC in the family, unless an early-onset CRC has been diagnosed in a given family.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Annual screening for endometrial and ovarian cancer with pelvic examination, endometrial biopsy, and transvaginal ultrasound beginning at age 30 to 35 years, or three to five years earlier than the earliest age of diagnosis of these cancers in the family (whichever is earlier). We offer prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy in women with Lynch syndrome at the end of childbearing or at age 40 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Upper endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric antrum starting at 30 to 35 years and treatment of <em>Helicobacter pylori </em>infection when found on biopsy. We perform a repeat upper endoscopy every two to three years in individuals with risk factors for gastric cancer. We carefully inspect the distal duodenum and terminal ileum for small intestinal cancers during upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Annual urinalysis examination beginning at age 30 to 35 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Annual physical examination including careful skin and neurological examination beginning at age 25 to 30 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with Lynch syndrome undergoing surgery for CRC or an endoscopically unresectable adenoma, total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis and annual endoscopic surveillance of the remaining rectum rather than segmental resection is recommended. Women undergoing surgery for CRC should be offered concurrent prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. (See <a href=\"#H20526201\" class=\"local\">'Management of colorectal cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> significantly reduces the incidence of cancer in Lynch syndrome. However, further studies are needed to identify the optimal dose and to clarify the overall benefits in CRC prevention and cardiovascular endpoints compared with potential risks such as bleeding.
