It occurs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and in parts of South America. The etiologic agent, <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>, is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium that causes a wide spectrum of clinical disease from mild to fulminant infection. Mortality from RMSF declined markedly in the last decade from 2.2 percent in 2000 to 0.3 percent in 2007, and has been essentially unchanged since that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The treatment of RMSF will be reviewed here. The basic biology of <em>R. rickettsii</em>, and the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of RMSF are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4101120159\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to treatment depends upon the certainty of disease and the severity of symptoms. Empiric therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> should be started if the diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is suspected, even if the symptoms are mild. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1953367993\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing likelihood of RMSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of RMSF is likely in patients who present with fever, headache, and constitutional symptoms in the spring and summer months if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are from an endemic area (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a known or possible tick bite (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;, section on 'Vectors'</a>) </p><p/><p>On occasion, a patient from a region endemic for RMSF may present with mild nonspecific symptoms without a rash, and without risk factors for exposure to a tick. Although the diagnosis of RMSF is unlikely in such patients, in certain settings, treatment may still be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H273208250\" class=\"local\">'If the diagnosis is unlikely'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H575010625\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients likely to have RMSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible in all patients who are likely to have RMSF. (See <a href=\"#H1953367993\" class=\"local\">'Assessing likelihood of RMSF'</a> above.) </p><p>It is particularly important that empiric therapy not be delayed if RMSF is suspected in patients who are severely ill (eg, severe headache or abdominal pain) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who present with possible complications associated with RMSF (eg, seizures, hypotension, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, jaundice). (See <a href=\"#H45432632\" class=\"local\">'Importance of early therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antibiotic'</a> below.) </p><p>Most patients will require empiric therapy for RMSF based upon clinical judgment and the epidemiologic setting since RMSF can rarely be confirmed or disproved in its early phase. Clinicians should <strong>not </strong>wait for the skin rash to develop before initiating treatment. (See <a href=\"#H45432632\" class=\"local\">'Importance of early therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with mild disease can generally be treated safely as an outpatient. By contrast, patients with severe symptoms should be hospitalized. Additional management considerations for patients with severe disease include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Empiric treatment for alternative diagnoses</strong> &ndash; Patients with RMSF may require empiric treatment for an alternative diagnosis while awaiting results from the initial diagnostic evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>). As an example, the early signs and symptoms of invasive meningococcal infection and RMSF are often difficult to distinguish. Thus, patients should receive empiric antibiotic therapy for both conditions if their symptoms are consistent with invasive meningococcal disease and RMSF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supportive care</strong> &ndash; Severely ill patients with RMSF should undergo hemodynamic monitoring since both hypovolemia and hypervolemia can occur. The tendency to hypervolemia in this setting is related to both the frequent presence of heart failure due to myocarditis and an increase in systemic vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Mechanical ventilation, dialysis, transfusions, and medications to control seizures also may be needed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273208250\"><span class=\"h2\">If the diagnosis is unlikely</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient is unlikely to have RMSF (see <a href=\"#H1953367993\" class=\"local\">'Assessing likelihood of RMSF'</a> above), they can be observed for up to 72 hours if there are no barriers to prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">prompt/easy</span> access to follow-up care <strong>and</strong> they meet <strong>both</strong> of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are mildly ill (eg, fever, nausea, mild headache, malaise, myalgias, and arthralgias).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They do not have risk factors for developing severe disease (severe disease is more likely to occur in men over 40 years of age, children less than 10 years old, individuals who abuse alcohol, and those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/1,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-8</a>].

Early therapy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is important since a delay in treatment has been associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/5,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8-10</a>]. The importance of early therapy is illustrated in the following studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 94 patients with RMSF, those who were treated within five days of symptom onset were significantly less likely to die than those who were treated after the fifth day (6.5 versus 22.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, 90 percent of patients saw a clinician during the first five days of illness; however, over half did not receive anti-rickettsial therapy at that time. Failure to initiate anti-rickettsial therapy was associated with absence of a skin rash, presentation within the first three days of illness, and presentation from August through April. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a different study, 205 cases of confirmed or probable RMSF were retrospectively reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among the patients who died, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> was initiated &ge;6 days after symptom onset (median seven days compared with three days in those who did not die). Late initiation of antimicrobial therapy may have been due, in part, to a delay in including RMSF in the differential diagnosis. </p><p/><p>For some patients, a delay in therapy may result from providers being unaware of the importance of early treatment. As an example, in a study of 84 providers, 23 percent incorrectly stated that it was appropriate to wait for the development of a skin rash before initiating therapy for RMSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANTIBIOTIC</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77984725\"><span class=\"h2\">Doxycycline as preferred agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend orally or intravenously administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for the treatment of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. For patients who experience common side effects to doxycycline (eg, nausea, diarrhea), we administer supportive treatment, such as antiemetics and antimotility agents, to help them complete the course of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H25298431\" class=\"local\">'Drug toxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3762467027\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> as the preferred agent is based upon in vitro data, animal studies, and over 50 years of clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, studies have reported a higher incidence of death with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> (the only alternative agent) compared with tetracyclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. In one retrospective study that evaluated 6388 patients with RMSF from 1981 to 1998, there were 213 deaths; the case fatality rate for patients treated only with chloramphenicol was significantly greater than that for patients treated only with tetracyclines (7.7 versus 1.6; odds ratio 5.5; 95% CI, 3.9-7.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81409777\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-pregnant adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> is given as 100 mg twice daily (orally or intravenously). For critically ill patients, we administer a single loading dose of 200 mg. Some providers give a loading regimen of doxycycline 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours for 72 hours since steady state serum concentrations of doxycycline are not achieved for up to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, this theory has never been tested in vitro or in vivo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38948640\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for the treatment of pregnant women with RMSF rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>. It should be administered as 100 mg twice daily (orally or intravenously). This approach is consistent with recommendations by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reflect the opinion of experts in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloramphenicol</a> had traditionally been the preferred treatment for most pregnant women with RMSF. Tetracyclines were generally contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of hepatotoxicity in the mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and adverse effects on fetal bone and teeth (eg, permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth from in utero exposure in the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], incorporation into fetal long tubular bones with transient inhibition of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]). However, these events are extremely rare with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, and subsequent evidence has supported the relative safety of doxycycline compared with older tetracyclines in both pregnancy and in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As an example, in a systematic review, there was no correlation between the use of doxycycline and teratogenic effects during pregnancy or dental staining in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, given the efficacy of doxycycline and the lack of other good alternatives, the benefits generally outweigh the risks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for children who weigh &le;45 kg is 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose</span> twice per day (maximum daily dose 200 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. Children who weigh &gt;45 kg should receive the adult dose. Tetracyclines can cause dental staining when administered to children younger than eight years. However, the risk of dental staining with doxycycline is minimal if a short course is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and in an observational study of 53 children who received approximately two courses of doxycycline for RMSF before they were eight years old, none developed dental staining in their permanent teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77984784\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloramphenicol</a> is the only known alternative agent for the treatment of RMSF. To our knowledge, no other alternative agents have been tested in humans.

The dose of chloramphenicol is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in four divided doses (maximum 4 grams per day); dose reductions are required if used to treat neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> may be difficult to rapidly obtain, and therefore, may not be a feasible option given the need to initiate therapy early in the course of disease. There is a low risk (1 in 25,000 to 40,000) of fatal aplastic anemia with chloramphenicol, and as a result, systemic use is restricted in many countries. If chloramphenicol cannot be obtained, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is the only studied treatment option. For individuals with a history of an adverse reaction to doxycycline, consultation with an allergist should be obtained, if possible, to help minimize the risk of an adverse event. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25298431\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug toxicity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3359366651\"><span class=\"h3\">Doxycycline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> is generally well tolerated except for mild nausea and vomiting. In addition, patients should be informed about photosensitivity associated with the use of doxycycline and counseled to take appropriate protective measures (eg, hat, long-sleeved shirts, sunscreen). Given the short duration of treatment, routine laboratory monitoring is not needed. Concerns related to the use of doxycycline in pregnancy are discussed above.

A complete blood count should be obtained at baseline and repeated every two days. The drug should be discontinued if hematologic abnormalities are observed (eg, reticulocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia). However, irreversible bone marrow suppression may occur weeks or months after therapy has been discontinued.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> is administered during the third trimester of pregnancy, it can be associated with &quot;Gray baby syndrome&quot; in premature infants and newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. &quot;Gray baby syndrome&quot; is characterized by cyanosis, abdominal distention, vasomotor collapse (often with irregular respiration), and death.

The etiologic agent, <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>, causes a wide spectrum of clinical disease ranging from mild to fulminant infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the diagnosis of RMSF is suspected, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible; delays in treatment of more than five days have been associated with an increased risk of mortality. (See <a href=\"#H4101120159\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H45432632\" class=\"local\">'Importance of early therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients will require empiric therapy based upon clinical judgment and the epidemiologic setting, since RMSF can rarely be confirmed or disproved in its early phase. For adults and children, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We prefer doxycycline even for pregnant women, since there is increasing evidence of the relative safety of doxycycline in pregnancy compared with older tetracyclines. (See <a href=\"#H4101120159\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antibiotic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients respond quickly to therapy with a rapid improvement in their clinical signs and symptoms. Treatment should be continued for at least three days after the patient has become afebrile; many experts recommend a minimum of seven days of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Response to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3762467027\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no commercially available vaccine to prevent RMSF. However, early detection and removal of attached ticks may prevent disease transmission. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Openshaw JJ, Swerdlow DL, Krebs JW, et al.
