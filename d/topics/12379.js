Those with advanced disease (stage III or IV) should also receive adjuvant therapy if they underwent primary surgical cytoreduction. However, patients who are not good candidates for surgery due to the location and volume of disease involvement or medical comorbidities at the time of diagnosis may be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead.

It is thought that optimal cytoreductive surgery increases the likelihood that chemotherapy will result in long-term disease-free survival. In some cases, including women who are not good candidates for radical cancer surgery, chemotherapy is administered first (neoadjuvant chemotherapy), with surgery performed following the chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy of early stage (stage I and II) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-line chemotherapy for advanced (stage III or IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. The average age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer in the United States is 63 years old. The age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer is younger among women with a hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome (<em>BRCA</em> gene mutations or Lynch syndrome). The lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is 1.3 percent. (See <a href=\"#H6099403\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of primary ovarian malignancies (95 percent) are derived from epithelial cells; the remainder arise from other ovarian cell types (germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286 \">figure 1</a>). Serous carcinoma, the most common histologic subtype of EOC, is similar in histology and clinical behavior to fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinomas. It has been proposed that ovarian and peritoneal carcinomas originate in the fallopian tubes. (See <a href=\"#H6099395\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for EOC include: increasing age, infertility, and endometriosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585 \">table 1</a>). Women with ovarian cancer susceptibility genes are at the highest risk of ovarian cancer, including <em>BRCA</em> gene mutations and Lynch syndrome. Factors that are associated with a decreased risk include: previous pregnancy, history of breastfeeding, oral contraceptives, and tubal ligation. (See <a href=\"#H6099403\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation may be either subacute or acute. Most commonly, the presentation is subacute (eg, pelvic or abdominal pain, bloating) or an adnexal mass is discovered incidentally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78148 \">table 2</a>). An acute presentation may occur in women with advanced disease and includes pleural effusion or bowel obstruction.

Pathology evaluation is performed following surgical removal of an ovary or fallopian tube or biopsies of the peritoneum.

Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is the standard staging procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1103846\" class=\"local\">'Staging and surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women with EOC require adjuvant treatment, specifically those with stage IC or II disease; those with stage III or IV disease who are candidates for primary surgical cytoreduction; and those with clear cell histology (any grade) or high tumor grade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 3</a>). However, patients who are not good candidates for surgery may be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead.
