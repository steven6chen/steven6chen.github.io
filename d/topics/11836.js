The quality, intensity, timing, and location of the murmur help distinguish a pathologic from a functional murmur but are of limited utility for evaluation of the severity or functional consequences of valve regurgitation. If valvular heart disease is suspected due to symptoms, a murmur auscultated on physical exam, or incidental findings on chest imaging or non-invasive imaging, then an echocardiogram is appropriate and findings should be correlated clinically with symptoms and evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The nature and severity of symptoms associated with chronic MR are related to the severity of the regurgitation, its rate of progression, the pulmonary artery pressure, and associated cardiac disease. In most cases, the patient remains relatively asymptomatic until the left ventricle begins to fail. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H135868515\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>The most common symptoms, when present, reflect a decreased forward or effective cardiac output and include weakness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. Patients with more severe disease and left ventricular enlargement eventually progress to symptomatic heart failure with pulmonary congestion and edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The murmur of MR is systolic, but its timing, duration, quality, intensity, location, and radiation are variable and depend upon the etiology and component of the mitral apparatus that is diseased. In most cases, the murmur is holosystolic, commencing with S1 and continuing up to and sometimes beyond and obscuring A2, a result of the persistent pressure gradient between the left ventricle and atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56783\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56783 \">movie 1</a>). The murmur is heard best over the apex, radiating to the axilla and when very loud may often radiate to the back. It is most often blowing and high pitched in quality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a variable correlation between murmur grade and regurgitant severity with primary mitral valve disease. A loud murmur associated with a thrill (Grade 4 or greater) has a specificity of 91 percent for severe regurgitation, but a sensitivity of only 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Conversely, severe regurgitation is rarely present with a Grade 1 to 2 murmur. However, there is a wide range of regurgitant severity with a Grade 3 murmur (which is common) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, the loudness of the murmur does not necessarily correlate with severity in secondary (functional) MR.

Predictors of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with moderate-to-severe or severe MR undergoing noncardiac surgery include depressed left ventricular systolic function, atrial fibrillation, ischemic MR, and comorbidities (ie, diabetes mellitus, history of carotid endarterectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients with good functional status and preserved left ventricular systolic function are generally tolerant of general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>].

Perioperative outcomes and predictors of risk were illustrated by the following two observational studies of patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR undergoing noncardiac surgery.

The procedural risk level (intermediate versus low), depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, and atrial fibrillation were independent predictors of morbidity. Atrial fibrillation was a predictor of in-hospital death. No comparison group was included. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A later study from a tertiary care center of 298 patients with moderate-severe or severe MR and 1172 controls without MR undergoing planned noncardiac surgery (78 percent intermediate risk) found low rates of postoperative mortality but high rates of postoperative morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The incidence of the primary outcome (a composite of 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) was higher in the MR group compared with the controls (22.2 percent versus 16.4 percent) due to higher rates of myocardial infarction and stroke. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups (1.7 and 1.1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Independent predictors of the primary outcome included left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35 percent, ischemic MR, diabetes mellitus, and history of carotid endarterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Of the patients with MR, 34 percent had ischemic MR and 66 percent had nonischemic MR as identified by echocardiograms.

In patients with MR, cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery is also impacted by other cardiac conditions that may be present, such as coronary artery disease. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation may cause as well as result from severe MR and heart failure should be appropriately treated.

However, mitral valve surgery prior to noncardiac surgery in these patients is not always feasible, as some patients require an urgent noncardiac procedure, in some the risk of mitral valve surgery may not be deemed acceptable, and some may decline mitral valve surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for intervention for severe chronic primary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although evidence is limited, most asymptomatic patients with severe MR can undergo urgent or elective noncardiac surgery at an acceptable risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including careful attention to afterload control and fluid balance, which can affect the severity of MR (particularly if functional). Thus, the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> valvular heart disease guideline noted that intermediate-risk elective noncardiac surgery with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic monitoring is reasonable to perform in adults with asymptomatic severe MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guideline on noncardiac surgery includes a similar statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risks and benefits of various treatment options should be carefully weighted if urgent noncardiac surgery is contemplated in a patient with symptomatic severe MR. </p><p>Intraoperative hemodynamic and anesthetic management of patients with MR are discussed separately. Summarized briefly, for patients with primary MR, preload should be maintained or reduced, to maintain intravascular volume while avoiding fluid overload, taking into consideration increased left ventricular volumes and compliance; and excessive systemic afterload should be avoided, as noted in the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> perioperative guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with MR, marked increases in blood pressure should be avoided since they can increase MR and diminish forward flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Patients with MR and heart failure require careful titration of diuretics and afterload reduction to optimize perioperative hemodynamic status.

Though data on hemodynamic monitoring in this setting are limited, invasive hemodynamic monitoring enables monitoring intracardiac filling pressures and vascular resistance, thus facilitating intravenous fluid management and appropriate use of vasodilators.

The inability of the aortic valve leaflets to remain closed or coapted during diastole results in a portion of the left ventricular stroke volume leaking back from the aorta into the left ventricle. The added volume of regurgitant blood produces an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume; as described by Laplace's law, the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume causes an elevation in wall stress. The heart responds with compensatory myocardial hypertrophy, which returns wall stress toward normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of hypertrophy and chamber enlargement raises the total stroke volume. The net effect is that forward stroke volume and therefore the cardiac output are initially maintained despite the regurgitant lesion. Although left ventricular volume is increased, end-diastolic pressure is normal due to an increase in ventricular compliance. Thus, the heart initially adapts well to chronic AR, functioning as a very efficient and compliant high output pump.</p><p>As a result of these hemodynamic changes, patients with AR remain asymptomatic for decades, even if there is progressive ventricular dilatation. In contrast, dramatic signs may be detected on physical examination when severe AR is present (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a wide pulse pressure, which is manifested on examination as a water hammer or Corrigan's pulse.

It is high pitched, often blowing in quality, and may be sustained in intensity or decrescendo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The intensity of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of AR. In some patients, the murmur is soft and barely audible, often appreciated only when the patient is sitting up, leaning forward, and holding his or her breath in expiration. However, the timing and duration of the murmur may be helpful. In mild AR, the murmur occurs only in early diastole; as the regurgitation becomes more severe, the murmur extends through more of diastole.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults#H1411845277\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;, section on 'Aortic valve surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Although evidence is limited, most asymptomatic patients with severe AR can undergo urgent noncardiac surgery at an acceptable risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including careful attention to afterload control and fluid balance. Thus, the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> valvular heart disease guideline noted that intermediate-risk elective noncardiac surgery with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic monitoring is reasonable to perform in adults with asymptomatic severe AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guideline on noncardiac surgery includes a similar statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risks and benefits of various treatment options should be carefully weighted if urgent, noncardiac surgery is contemplated in a patient with symptomatic severe AR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;, section on 'General management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraoperative hemodynamic and anesthetic management of patients with AR are discussed separately. Summarized briefly, heart rate should be maintained since bradycardia-associated increases in total diastolic time may acutely increase AR, which may precipitate decompensated heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; afterload should be controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; and preload should be maintained or reduced as needed to maintain adequate intravascular volume without precipitating fluid overload, taking into consideration increased left ventricular volumes and compliance. In patients with advanced AR, marked increases in systemic blood pressure should be avoided since they can diminish forward flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Patients with heart failure and AR require diuretics and afterload reduction to optimize volume status prior to noncardiac surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-or-mitral-valve-disease#H440052487\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with aortic or mitral valve disease&quot;, section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with moderate-to-severe or severe AR undergoing moderate- or higher-risk noncardiac surgery should receive intraoperative invasive hemodynamic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transesophageal echocardiography monitoring and postoperative intensive care unit monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-mitral-or-aortic-regurgitation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Though data on hemodynamic monitoring in this setting are limited, invasive hemodynamic monitoring enables monitoring intracardiac filling pressures and vascular resistance, thus facilitating intravenous fluid management and appropriate use of vasodilators.
