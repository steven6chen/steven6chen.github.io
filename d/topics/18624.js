It often makes you feel like you are about to fall or pass out. Dizziness can also cause you to feel lightheaded or make it hard for you to walk straight.</p><p>Vertigo is a type of dizziness that makes you feel like you are spinning, swaying, or tilting, or like the room is moving around you. These feelings come and go, and might last seconds, hours, or days. You might feel worse when you move your head, change positions, cough, or sneeze.</p><p>Some people with vertigo have trouble walking. Some people with vertigo have nausea and might vomit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1742292307\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes vertigo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of vertigo include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inner ear problems</strong> &ndash; Deep inside the ear, there is a small network of tubes that are filled with fluid. Floating inside that fluid are special calcium deposits. Together, these tubes and deposits make up the &quot;vestibular system.&quot; This system tells the brain what position the body is in. It also helps keep you balanced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52509\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52509 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the tubes inside your inner ear get swollen, or if they form extra calcium deposits, you can develop vertigo and balance problems. You can also get vertigo if swelling puts pressure on nerves in the inner ear. Sometimes this swelling is caused by a viral infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Head injury</strong> &ndash; Head injuries and concussion can disturb the inner ear and lead to vertigo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; Some medicines can damage the inner ear and cause vertigo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migraine headaches</strong> &ndash; Migraine headaches can sometimes cause vertigo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brain problems</strong> &ndash; Brain problems, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, can also cause vertigo.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1742292314\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have vertigo and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a new or severe headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start to see double or have trouble seeing clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble speaking or hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have weakness in an arm or leg or your face droops to one side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have numbness or tingling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot stop vomiting</p><p/><p>You should also see your doctor or nurse if you have vertigo that lasts for several minutes or more and you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older than 60</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had a stroke in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are at risk for having a stroke, for example because you have diabetes or you smoke</p><p/><p>If you have dizziness or vertigo that comes and goes but you do not have any of the problems listed above, make an appointment with your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3931748710\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor will start by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. During the exam, he or she will check:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How you walk and keep your balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How your eyes work when you watch a moving object, and when your head is turned from side to side</p><p/><p>Depending on what your doctor finds during the exam, he or she might order more tests to better understand your hearing or balance problems. In some cases, the doctor will order an MRI of your brain. An MRI is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1742292321\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vertigo treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor knows what is causing your vertigo, he or she will probably try to treat that problem directly. For instance, if you have calcium deposits in your inner ear, the doctor might try to get them out by moving your head in a special way.</p><p>Your doctor can also give you medicines that might help your vertigo and relieve nausea and vomiting.</p><p>If your vertigo is really bad, your doctor might also suggest a treatment called &quot;balance rehabilitation.&quot; This treatment teaches you exercises that can help you cope with your vertigo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1742292328\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to deal with my vertigo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have trouble standing or walking because of vertigo, you are at risk of falling. To reduce the risk of falls, make your home as safe as possible. Get rid of loose electrical cords, clutter, and slippery rugs. Also, make sure that you wear sturdy, non-slip shoes, and that your walkways are clear and well lit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1742292335\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dizziness-and-vertigo-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dizziness and vertigo (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
