General issues related to topical therapies will be reviewed here with a particular emphasis upon the use of topical corticosteroids.</p><p>There are five components to the successful use of topical therapies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correct diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of lesion being treated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vehicle (the base in which the active medication is delivered)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Method used to apply the medication</p><p/><p>The type of lesion being treated is important. In acute contact dermatitis from poison ivy with moist weeping lesions, wet dressing changes or lotions will help &quot;dry up&quot; the dermatitis while providing cool, soothing relief. Thus, for acute exudative dermatoses, bland treatments in liquid vehicles (eg, lotions) are generally recommended. In contrast, when treating chronic psoriasis, therapeutic agents incorporated into creams or ointments may help to retain native moisture and provide relief to dry, pruritic skin.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles. If the correct medication but the wrong vehicle is used, the response to therapy may be delayed, inadequate, or in some cases, worsened. As examples, use of a corticosteroid gel on hand eczema and fissures will cause increased pain and stinging due to the alcohol base of the gel. Treating a moist lesion with an ointment may cause folliculitis secondary to its occlusive properties.</p><p>In addition to the type of lesion being treated and the base of the treatment vehicle, topical drug penetration into the skin is determined by the method of topical application. For optimal absorption of most topical drugs, apply them to moist skin either immediately after bathing or after wet soaks. Occlusive dressings will also enhance drug absorption, often by a factor of 10. The site of an application is also important as variations in the epidermal layer will alter the extent of drug absorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VEHICLE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vehicles consist of three basic ingredients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Powders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oils</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liquids (eg, water)</p><p/><p>Powders absorb moisture, decrease friction, and help cover wide areas easily. Oils act as emollients and, because of their occlusive properties, often enhance drug penetration. Liquids in vehicles evaporate, providing a cooling, soothing sensation, while aiding exudative lesions to dry. Combinations of these three ingredients in varying proportions make up the most commonly used vehicles, which are described below. The optimal vehicles for different body locations and lesions are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60921 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ointments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ointments consist predominantly of water suspended in oil. This type of vehicle is an excellent lubricant, facilitates heat retention, decreases transepidermal water loss, provides enhanced medication absorption, and is semiocclusive. Ointments are generally the most potent vehicles due to their occlusive effect, but patient acceptance may be low because they are greasy, and they are not useful in hairy areas. Ointments should be applied two to three times per day to dry, lichenified lesions, particularly after moistening the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Creams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creams are semisolid emulsions of oil in 20 to 50 percent water and can be washed off with water. They are cosmetically appealing vehicles for delivering topical medications. For the same medication, cream formulations are usually stronger than lotions, but less potent than ointments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lotions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lotions (as well as aerosols and solutions) are the least potent topical therapies, but are useful in hairy areas and in conditions where large areas have to be treated. They consist of powder-in-water; thus, patients must shake the container before each application to receive the desired therapeutic concentration (and therefore the desired effect). In addition, as lotions evaporate, they provide a cooling and drying effect, making them useful for treating moist dermatoses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solutions contain water or non-aqueous liquids such as alcohol or propylene glycol. Solutions such as bath soaks and open wet dressings provide coolness and aid in drying exudative lesions by means of evaporation. In addition, vasoconstriction results in decreased local blood flow and reduction in local edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Wet dressings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wet dressings permit the cleansing of exudate while maintaining drainage in infected lesions (eg, ulcers). Wet dressings should be changed every six hours for two to three days before judging their effectiveness. Closed wet dressings consist of a wet dressing covered by an impermeable substance such as a polyurethane plastic (eg, Saran Wrap), which allows heat to be retained, prevents evaporation, and causes maceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gels are an oil-in-water emulsion with alcohol in the base, and they dry in a thin, greaseless, nonstaining film. Gel formulations combine the best therapeutic advantages of ointments with the best cosmetic advantages of creams. Gels are transparent, colorless, semisolid emulsions that liquefy on contact with the skin. They are an efficient method for delivering medications to hair-bearing areas and for treating acne.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Foams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foams are pressurized collections of gaseous bubbles in a matrix of liquid film. Foam preparations spread readily and are easier to apply than other preparations, particularly for inflamed skin and for scalp dermatoses. They are also often more cosmetically acceptable, which can lead to higher compliance.</p><p>Unlike other vehicles, foams depend on the vehicle delivery system for the physical delivery of the drug. Because of the complexities in designing vehicle delivery systems, foam preparations tend to be more expensive than other vehicles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids induce an antiinflammatory response in the skin by a variety of mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. They also appear to have antimitotic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; this finding may help explain their utility in the treatment of scaling dermatoses, and may relate to the occurrence of dermal thinning due to fibroblast inhibition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Potency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids induce cutaneous vasoconstriction commensurate with their potency. The standard vasoconstriction bioassay provides potency measurements that correlate well with clinical antiinflammatory efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>According to the USA classification system, topical corticosteroids can be subdivided into seven groups, with group one being the most potent and group seven the least potent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>). A group I agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate ointment) is approximately 1000 times more potent than 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>.</p><p>Corticosteroids are better absorbed through areas of inflammation and desquamation than normal skin, and more readily through the thin stratum corneum of infants than the skin of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, anatomic regions with a thin epidermis are significantly more permeable to topical steroids than thick-skinned areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Regional differences in percutaneous absorption (percent of the total dose absorbed across the body) are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sole of foot &ndash; 0.14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palm &ndash; 0.83 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forearm &ndash; 1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalp &ndash; 3.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forehead &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandible &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genitalia &ndash; 42 percent</p><p/><p>Other factors that affect topical corticosteroid potency include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increases in concentration of a particular corticosteroid within a finite range in a defined vehicle enhance potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive dressings promote cutaneous hydration and significantly increase absorption and potency. Occlusion can enhance topical corticosteroid potency by as much as 100-fold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ointment preparations generally allow better percutaneous drug absorption and are therefore more potent than creams and lotions. One exception is the super-potent topical corticosteroid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate) that may be packaged in &quot;optimized&quot; cream vehicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroid selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The corticosteroid selection depends, to some extent, upon the condition being treated. In general, it is best to start with the lowest potency agents needed and use for as short a period of time as possible. Some general recommendations regarding selection of the optimal corticosteroid preparation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Super high potency corticosteroids are used for severe dermatoses over <span class=\"nowrap\">nonfacial/nonintertriginous</span> areas (eg, psoriasis, severe atopic dermatitis, severe contact dermatitis). They are especially useful over the palms and soles, which tend to resist topical corticosteroid penetration due to the thick stratum corneum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medium to high potency strength preparations are appropriate for mild to moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">nonfacial/nonintertriginous</span> dermatoses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyelid and genital dermatoses should be managed with low-potency topical corticosteroids for limited time periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low to medium strength preparations should be considered when large areas are treated because of the likelihood of systemic absorption.</p><p/><p>Generic topical corticosteroids are effective for treating the majority of skin disorders seen in the primary care setting. Generic medications often have slightly less potency or less cosmetically appealing vehicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but the often substantial cost savings may negate any differences in efficacy or feel.</p><p>Penetration and efficacy are optimized when topical corticosteroids are applied to moist skin after bathing or soaking in water. However, they may also be applied to dry skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of daily use of super high potency topical corticosteroids should not exceed three weeks if possible, although persistent lesions on small areas may be treated for a longer time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. High potency and medium strength preparations rarely cause cutaneous side effects if used for less than six to eight weeks, although they can occur with shorter courses of treatment, especially on the face and intertriginous areas.</p><p>For some disorders, intermittent therapy may be effective for maintaining long-term disease control. In randomized trials, twice-weekly application of topical corticosteroids has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with atopic dermatitis once the underlying dermatosis is under control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema#H41442152\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Maintenance and prevention of relapses'</a>.)</p><p>Side effects are rare with low potency topical corticosteroids; nevertheless, intermittent therapy may be preferable to continuous therapy for the long-term treatment of large skin areas. Facial, intertriginous, and genital dermatoses should be treated for short one to two week intervals since these areas are most susceptible to corticosteroid-induced atrophy, telangiectasia, and acneiform eruption (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous'</a> below). Application to highly permeable areas also increases systemic absorption and is another reason to limit the duration of treatment in these areas. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Systemic'</a> below.)</p><p>Topical corticosteroids should be discontinued when the skin condition has resolved. Rebound flares can be avoided by tapering topical therapy with a gradual reduction of both potency and dosing frequency at two-week intervals.</p><p>Longer courses of therapy may be necessary for patients with chronic diseases, and these individuals should be closely monitored for the development of adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Use in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of lower potency (groups 4 to 7, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>)) topical corticosteroids in children is generally safe when used for short durations and for appropriate inflammatory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Children under age 12 years typically should not use potent or super potent topical corticosteroids. An exception can be made for very severe inflammatory dermatoses (eg, psoriasis, severe atopic dermatitis), for which short courses (up to two weeks) of more potent (groups 1 to 3) topical corticosteroids may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Corticosteroids'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Topical corticosteroids'</a>.)</p><p>To minimize the risk of side effects, high potency corticosteroids (including combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antifungal/topical</span> corticosteroid products) should not be used on the face, intertriginous, or other thin-skinned highly penetrable areas (eg, the perineum, axillae) in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In addition, high potency corticosteroids ideally should be used only once a day and should not be administered for longer than two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Even low potency topical corticosteroids can cause side effects in children when used for extended periods of time. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Combination antifungal/topical corticosteroid products'</a> below.)</p><p>Children usually require significantly less topical corticosteroids for a given condition than do adults because children have a smaller body surface area. Based upon calculation of mean body surface area, one guideline for topical corticosteroids quantities suggests that infants be given one-fifth of the adult dose, children be given two-fifths of the adult dose, and adolescents be given two-thirds of adult doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Use during pregnancy or lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available data on the safety of topical corticosteroids in pregnancy are limited and mainly based upon small and poor-quality observational studies. One case-control study of 106 patients found an increased risk for orofacial cleft with topical corticosteroid use in the first trimester of pregnancy and a cohort study of 99 women reported a correlation between low birth weight and high potency topical corticosteroid use during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, a systematic review found no conclusive evidence supporting an association between maternal use of topical corticosteroids during pregnancy and congenital anomalies, preterm delivery, or stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two subsequent population-based studies did not find an association between topical corticosteroid use in the first trimester and risk of orofacial clefts, preterm delivery, miscarriage, or stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, one of these studies showed a significant association of low birth weight with maternal exposure to potent or very potent topical corticosteroids (relative risk [RR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.1), but not with exposure to mild- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another study found that the risk of low birth weight was significantly increased only when the amount of potent or very potent corticosteroids exceeded 300 grams (RR 7.7, 95% CI 1.5-40.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that for pregnant women who need treatment with topical corticosteroids mild or moderate topical corticosteroids should be preferred to potent or superpotent preparations. If potent or superpotent topical corticosteroids are needed, the amount used should be kept to a minimum and fetal growth should be monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>It is not known whether topical corticosteroids are secreted in breast milk; no adverse effects have been noted in lactating women. The drugs should not be applied to the nipples prior to nursing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids are safer than systemic glucocorticoids. Nevertheless, cutaneous and systemic side effects can occur, particularly with super potent and potent drugs, or extensive use of lower potency agents with or without occlusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of cutaneous effects may occur with topical corticosteroid use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Super potent and potent topical corticosteroids may induce atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae as early as two to three weeks following daily application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Intertriginous and thin-skinned highly penetrable areas are particularly susceptible to atrophy, which usually recovers within weeks to months if therapy is discontinued as soon as atrophic change occurs. A small study of 20 patients with psoriasis found that limited use (to skin lesions less than 2x2 cm) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate ointment (a group 3 agent) for 10 weeks on the face and intertriginous areas did not cause atrophy or telangiectasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged use of topical steroids may induce an acneiform eruption that resolves with discontinuance of corticosteroids treatment. Chronic application of topical steroids to the face also may cause a dry, scaly eruption with scattered follicular pustules around the mouth (perioral dermatitis), and use of potent topical corticosteroids on the face can cause a facial eruption that is indistinguishable from rosacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Treatment includes discontinuation of steroid therapy with a gradual taper.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal of topical corticosteroids after prolonged use, especially on the face or genitals, may induce a varying constellation of signs and symptoms including erythema, burning or stinging sensation, pruritus, pain, and facial hot flashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These symptoms occur days to weeks after steroid discontinuation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other cutaneous side effects of topical corticosteroids include purpura, changes in pigmentation, and hypertrichosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic sensitization to topical corticosteroid preparations can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Vehicles or preservatives most often are the sensitizing agents, although contact allergy against the steroid moiety itself is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Topical glucocorticoid-induced contact allergy should be suspected in patients with chronic dermatoses that appear to be exacerbated by therapy. Patch testing is useful for determining whether contact dermatitis associated with a topical corticosteroid is secondary to the vehicle or to the corticosteroid itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Cross-reactions between different topical corticosteroids are determined by their chemical structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The classification of topical corticosteroids (class A through D) by pattern of cross-reactivity is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63402\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63402 \">figure 1</a>). Cross reactivity between groups is not uncommon. Class C topical corticosteroids have the lowest rate of allergenicity. Referral for patch testing may be indicated in patients whose history and examination are suggestive of a contact dermatitis to topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids, particularly group 1 agents (the strongest), can cause significant hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) suppression using as little as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> for two or more weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In one report, temporary reversible suppression was noted in 8 of 40 patients (20 percent) with psoriasis treated with super potent topical corticosteroids for three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Factors that predispose to HPA suppression include use of high potency corticosteroids, chronic use, application to highly permeable areas, treatment of large areas, occlusion, poor skin integrity, liver failure, and young age. Routine use of even mild corticosteroids in young children can cause HPA axis suppression. Systemic absorption is increased when there is an altered skin barrier, which is common in the conditions for which these medications are prescribed.</p><p>Hyperglycemia and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, chronic periorbital application of topical corticosteroids may induce posterior subcapsular cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Topical corticosteroids can also worsen and alter the appearance of tinea skin infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatophyte-tinea-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatophyte (tinea) infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1591664\"><span class=\"h2\">Tachyphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tachyphylaxis, a progressive decrease in clinical response due to repetitive use of a drug, occurs when the body becomes tolerant to the pharmacotherapeutic effects of a particular medication. Even if the medication previously worked well, it may become ineffective. Allowing for drug-free intervals or switching to alternative agents may alleviate tachyphylaxis. </p><p>Tachyphylaxis has been associated with topical corticosteroid use based upon experimental data showing reductions in corticosteroid-induced vasoconstriction, anti-proliferative effects, and inhibition of histamine release following repeated applications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. However, some authors have challenged that this data may not be broadly applicable to clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In one study of 32 patients with psoriasis that specifically assessed for tachyphylaxis, no evidence for this phenomenon was observed during daily treatment with a high potency topical corticosteroid for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In the clinical setting, decreased patient adherence to treatment regimens over time is another factor that may account for apparent reductions in corticosteroid efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRALESIONAL CORTICOSTEROID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intralesional corticosteroids, in a variety of concentrations, are used to treat keloids, hemangiomas, acne cysts, stubborn psoriatic plaques, and alopecia areata. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> acetonide (2.5 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> triamcinolone diacetate (5 to 40 mg), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> sodium succinate (10 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> and methylprednisolone acetate (40 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> are used commonly. Adverse effects include local reactions and systemic absorption with problems similar to that of systemic corticosteroids. In addition, localized atrophy, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, and sterile abscesses may occur related to intralesional injections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">PITFALLS OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assuming that a proper diagnosis is made, the most common treatment errors are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suboptimal medication use related to either too low or too high medication strength, improper vehicle, or insufficient dosage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of patient adherence as a result of inadequate patient education or adverse drug events</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of combination <span class=\"nowrap\">steroid/antifungal</span> formulations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug interactions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disregard for medication costs</p><p/><p>The first three issues are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Suboptimal medication use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent example of suboptimal medication use is the patient with extensive or facial contact dermatitis who is given a five to seven day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> dose pack (ie, a tapering dose over five to seven days) along with a 30 gram tube of 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream. The patient does well for two or three days at the highest dosage of prednisolone, but new lesions continue to develop. A better treatment regimen involves using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> as the oral glucocorticoid, given in high enough dosage (eg, 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of ideal body weight) for a long enough time to cover the 7 to 10 days of lesion outbreak. In addition, the hydrocortisone cream is not strong enough to treat most cases of moderate inflammation, and the quantity prescribed is sufficient to cover the involved areas for only three days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis#H6508920\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;, section on 'Active treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Other common examples include selecting the incorrect fungal agent for a documented fungal infection (eg, using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> for a dermatophyte infection when the drug is active only against Candida), or using topical antifungal agents for tinea capitis when oral therapy is the correct route of administration (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatophyte-tinea-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatophyte (tinea) infections&quot;</a>). Another problem is using a medication for too short a time period to effectively treat the condition (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=griseofulvin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">griseofulvin</a> for tinea capitis for less than a month, as it must be used for a minimum of at least two to three months).</p><p>When prescribing a medication, the amount to be dispensed needs to be considered carefully. An insufficient amount of medication used by the patient will lead most often to an inadequate therapeutic response. When considering the amount used per application, the number of applications to be given daily, and the duration of therapy, the prescription can be written so the patient will not run out of medication prematurely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76586 \">table 3</a>). The Fingertip Unit (FTU) is a convenient method to estimate the amount of a topical preparation to be used per application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Each FTU is approximately equivalent to 0.5 and 0.4 grams of ointment in men and women, respectively. An estimate of the number of FTUs required to cover various areas of the body is as follows: head and neck = 4.5; trunk (front or back) = 7; one arm = 3; one hand = 1; one leg = 6; and one foot = 2.</p><p>Patients should be educated about the appropriate way to apply topical medications. Creams and ointments should be rubbed in until they disappear, since there is no advantage in leaving a thick layer on the skin. With foam vehicles, a small quantity (eg, the size of a golf ball) should be sprayed into the cap or on a saucer and then applied with a fingertip to the affected areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper patient adherence to the prescribed treatment includes receiving thorough patient education about the nature of the problem and proper use of the medication. As an example, one of the most difficult conditions to successfully manage is urticaria. Patients are miserable, and the unpredictable nature of the outbreaks requires that the clinician provide extra emotional support. Patients expect the urticaria to resolve while medications are taken &quot;as necessary.&quot; If the patient understands that taking antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a>) &quot;around the clock&quot; is an essential aspect in management, both the clinician and patient are more likely to be satisfied with the outcome.</p><p>Patients with chronic conditions such as acne or atopic dermatitis must be educated about the natural history of exacerbations and remissions, as well as the time needed to see any improvement after initiating the designated pharmacotherapy. Otherwise, patients may relate that the medication was working, but the desired effect did not persist after discontinuing its use. Clinicians also may hear from a teenager's parent, calling to state that the antibiotic prescribed two weeks ago is making the child's acne worse. As most treatments may not show any beneficial effects for six to eight weeks, it is helpful to explain the natural course of acne and arrive at mutual, realistic expectations.</p><p>If the skin condition is not responding, remember that the diagnosis and treatment may be correct, but the patient may not be following your recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Ask patients to bring all of their medications (both prescription and over-the-counter) with them to every office visit. Are the tubes of cream still full? Are there as many pills used as expected? Are there other reasons for not complying with medication use, such as cost or adverse drug effects?</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination antifungal/topical corticosteroid products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinicians will prescribe a combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antifungal/topical</span> steroid product to a patient with a skin lesion because they are unsure if the diagnosis is fungal or inflammatory dermatitis. Usually a simple potassium hydroxide (KOH) scraping can differentiate the two conditions enabling the clinician to prescribe one rather than two medications. Two problems with these combination products are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are expensive compared to generic topical steroid and over the counter topical antifungal products alone. In one study, nondermatologists were more likely than dermatologists to prescribe combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antifungal/topical</span> steroid products for the treatment of common fungal skin infections (34 versus 5 percent), costing an addition $10 to 25 million dollars as a whole to the healthcare system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The steroid preparation in the combination products is potent. If patients are using the potent steroid on a simple fungal infection, they risk incomplete resolution of the fungal infection as well as thinning of the skin if used for a prolonged period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical medications are available in a variety of vehicles, including ointments, creams, lotions, solutions, gels, and foams. Factors such as lesion quality (eg, moist versus dry) and location (eg, hairy versus nonhairy skin) play an important role in vehicle selection. Care should be taken to select the most appropriate vehicle. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Vehicle selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical corticosteroids are classified into seven groups according to potency. The potency of a drug is influenced by the vehicle. In the clinical setting, the use of occlusion can increase the potency of topical corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Potency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous atrophy is a potential side effect of topical corticosteroid therapy, and is more likely to occur with the use of higher potency agents. In general, the use of super high potency topical corticosteroids should be restricted to highly inflammatory dermatoses on the scalp, trunk, or extremities. Facial or intertriginous areas are most likely to develop signs of cutaneous atrophy. Lesions in these areas should be treated with low potency corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Topical corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with topical corticosteroids should be restricted to the shortest duration of therapy required to achieve the desired effect. Acneiform eruptions, purpura, hypopigmentation, glaucoma, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are additional side effects that may occur with topical corticosteroid use. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Topical corticosteroids'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suboptimal medication use due to improper prescribing or poor communication with patients can result in treatment failure. When prescribing topical medications, care should be taken to ensure that the quantity prescribed is sufficient to cover the entire treatment area for the duration of treatment.
