Eating them might also help prevent certain types of cancers. Try to eat fruits and vegetables at each meal and for snacks. If you don't have fresh fruits and vegetables, you can eat frozen or canned ones instead. Doctors recommend eating at least 2 and a half servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruits each day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods with fiber &ndash; Eating foods with a lot of fiber can help prevent heart disease and strokes. If you have type 2 diabetes, it can also help control your blood sugar. Foods that have a lot of fiber include vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, oatmeal, and some breads and cereals. You can tell how much fiber is in a food by reading the nutrition label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51585 \">figure 1</a>). Doctors recommend eating 25 to 36 grams of fiber each day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods with folate (also called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>) &ndash; Folate is a vitamin that is important for pregnant women and women who plan to get pregnant. Pregnant women need to get enough folate so that their unborn baby can grow normally. Folate is found in many breakfast cereals, oranges, orange juice, and green leafy vegetables.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods with calcium and vitamin D &ndash; Babies, children, and adults need calcium and vitamin D to help keep their bones strong. Adults also need calcium and vitamin D to help prevent osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition that causes bones to get thin and break more easily than usual. Different foods and drinks have calcium and vitamin D in them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>). People who don't get enough calcium and vitamin D in their diet might need to take a supplement. Supplements are pills, capsules, liquids, or tablets that have nutrients in them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26962728\"><span class=\"h1\">What about fats?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different types of fats. Some types of fats are better for your body than others.</p><p>Trans fats are especially unhealthy. They are found in margarines, many fast foods, and some store-bought baked goods. Trans fats can raise your cholesterol level and your chance of getting heart disease. Try to avoid eating foods with these types of fats.</p><p>The type of polyunsaturated fats found in fish seems to be healthy and can reduce your chance of getting heart disease. Other polyunsaturated fats might also be healthy. Experts used to think that monounsaturated fats were good for you and saturated fats were bad, but newer research suggests that might not be true. In fact, these fats do not seem to have much effect on your chance of getting heart disease.</p><p>When you cook, use oils with some healthier fats, such as olive oil and canola oil.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26962735\"><span class=\"h1\">What about alcohol?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who drink a small amount of alcohol each day might have a lower chance of getting heart disease. But drinking alcohol can lead to problems. For example, it can raise a person's chances of getting liver disease and certain types of cancers.</p><p>Most doctors recommend that adult women not have more than 1 drink a day and that adult men not have more than 2 drinks a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26962742\"><span class=\"h1\">How many calories do I need each day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of calories you need each day depends on your weight, height, age, sex, and how active you are.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse can tell you how many calories you should eat each day. If you are trying to lose weight, you should eat fewer calories each day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26962749\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have questions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have questions about which foods you should or should not eat, ask your doctor or nurse. The right diet for you will depend, in part, on your health and any medical conditions you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26962756\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetes and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-solid-foods-with-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Starting solid foods with babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplements-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin supplements (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-mellitus-and-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-solid-foods-during-infancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Starting solid foods during infancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
