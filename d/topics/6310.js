Transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis are the next most common (approximately 8 percent). Other parenchymal epithelial tumors, such as oncocytomas, collecting duct tumors, and renal sarcomas, occur infrequently. Nephroblastoma or Wilms' tumor is common in children (5 to 6 percent of all primary renal tumors), while renal medullary carcinoma is a rare form of RCC seen in sickle cell disease.

RCC occurs predominantly in the sixth to eighth decade of life with median age at diagnosis around 64 years of age, according to the 2003 to 2007 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Cancer Statistics Review; it is unusual in patients under 40 years of age and rare in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H640028914\"><span class=\"h2\">Race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the United States, Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders have the lowest incidence of renal cancers compared with American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indians/Alaska</span> natives, <span class=\"nowrap\">Hispanic/Latinos,</span> Whites, or African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1046154222\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the SEER registry covering 2005 through 2011 show the extent of disease at presentation of patients with renal cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized disease (ie, confined to the kidney) &ndash; 65 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional disease (ie, spread to regional lymph nodes) &ndash; 16 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic disease &ndash; 16 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstaged &ndash; 3 percent </p><p/><p>In an analysis of over 29,000 cases from the SEER registry, there has been a steady decrease in the size of tumors at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is likely due to the greater number of incidental tumors detected on abdominal imaging.

The independent contribution of both has been difficult to sort out due to their close correlation with hypertension itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In one international multicenter study of over 1700 patients with RCCs and 2300 controls, an increased risk of cancer was observed in those exposed to asbestos (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8), cadmium (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9), and gasoline (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Studies of occupational exposures are often limited by the lack of specific exposure details. Increased exposure to such carcinogens may be associated with mutations in genes associated with the pathogenesis of RCC, such as the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between mutations in this gene and exposure to trichloroethylene, a petroleum by-product used as a metal degreaser, was evaluated in 44 patients with RCC and known exposure to the toxin, 107 with RCC but no known exposure, and 97 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A specific mutational hot spot in the VHL gene was found in 39 percent of those with toxin exposure, but in none of those without exposure or in any of the healthy individuals.

In one study, none of 36 chromophobe RCCs expressed cyclin D1 (measured by immunohistochemistry) or had a CCND1 rearrangement; however, 21 of 63 (33 percent) oncocytomas showed cyclin D1 overexpression, and 12 of these (57 percent) were positive for a CCND1 rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. </p><p>Renal oncocytomas almost invariably behave in a benign fashion, despite the recognition that the growth rate could be similar to RCC. Even when very large, they are generally well encapsulated and are rarely invasive or associated with metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>].</p><p>A coexisting RCC can be identified in 10 to 32 percent of patients with oncocytoma, especially in those patients presenting with diffuse oncocytic nodules involving the renal parenchyma (also known as renal oncocytosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/115,120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,120,121</a>]. Thus, patients with oncocytomas should be closely monitored and treated if there is evidence of rapid growth of the renal tumor.</p><p>Despite the high frequency of coexisting RCCs, the risk of metachronous renal tumors after resection of an oncocytoma is low. In a retrospective single-institution series of 424 patients who were followed for a median of seven years after radical or partial nephrectomy, 17 subsequent renal tumors (4 percent) were identified at a median of three years after the original diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

Transitional cell carcinomas arising in the renal pelvis account for approximately 8 percent, while other rare tumors comprise the rest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common histologic pattern of RCC is clear cell (75 to 85 percent). Papillary and chromophobe tumors constitute 10 to 15 and 5 to 10 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of RCC has been steadily increasing in the United States, while the size of primary RCCs has been gradually decreasing. These trends have been attributed, in part, to the diagnosis of asymptomatic tumors using noninvasive abdominal imaging modalities. (See <a href=\"#H175757290\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors associated with a significantly increased incidence of RCC include smoking, obesity, hypertension, and others. RCC has also been associated with a variety of inherited syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Established risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary kidney cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of RCC is incompletely understood. Abnormalities of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor have been implicated in the majority of sporadic cases of RCC.
