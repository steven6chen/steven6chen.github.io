It represents a gradual change in the pattern of adrenal secretory response to corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH), characterized by a disproportionate rise of 17-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) relative to cortisol. This change primarily occurs in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, the cells of which express a unique pattern of steroidogenic enzymes that includes expression of sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1), which catalyzes the formation of DHEAS, the major adrenarchal steroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58179 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal adrenarche&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Although premature adrenarche is a variant of normal, it is associated with moderately increased risks for polycystic ovary syndrome, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in adulthood. &#160;</p><p>The causes, diagnosis, and management of premature adrenarche will be reviewed here. It is useful, however, to begin with a review of definitions used to describe the various aspects of premature sexual development as they relate to adrenarche.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitions used to describe normal and premature puberty and pubarche are as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty is the stage of development during which secondary sex characteristics appear and there is a transition from the sexually immature to the sexually mature stage. True puberty (also termed &quot;central&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; puberty) results from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Testicular enlargement is the usual first sign of gonadal activation (gonadarche) in boys, and breast development (thelarche) is the first sign in girls, with sexual hair development usually occurring later. The physiology and clinical stages of puberty are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Premature puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact age at which puberty is abnormally early (precocious) is not well defined. In general, signs of secondary sexual development occurring before the age of eight years in girls and the age of nine years in boys are considered premature and warrant careful evaluation. This practice is supported by data in girls, though breast budding is normal during the seventh year in Black and Mexican-American girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], while good data are still lacking in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (also termed &quot;central,&quot; &quot;true,&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; precocity) results from activation of the normal HPG axis. Gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (also termed &quot;peripheral&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; precocious puberty) results from excess exposure to androgens or estrogens derived from the gonads, adrenal glands, exogenous sources, or from ectopic production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by a tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pubarche</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pubarche is the term applied to the appearance of sexual hair (Tanner stage 3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>). Although this development requires adrenarchal levels of androgen, sexual hair ordinarily does not appear until shortly after clinical evidence of gonadarche (ie, breast development in girls and testicular enlargement in boys). In girls, sexual hair usually appears first on the labia majora, and the hair gradually spreads upwards onto the mons; in some girls, sexual hair growth begins in the axilla. Tanner stage 3 pubic hair appears in five percent or less of normal-weight American eight and nine year old girls and boys, respectively, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, irrespective of ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While pre-sexual hair (Tanner stage 2) development precedes the onset of sexual hair, it is an unreliable sign of pubarche, because similar vellus hair development may be due to hypertrichosis. (See <a href=\"#H2485518\" class=\"local\">'Hypertrichosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Premature pubarche</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature pubarche refers to the physical finding of isolated appearance of sexual hair (ie, unaccompanied by breast development) before the age of eight years in girls and nine years in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is more common in girls; the ratio of affected girls to boys is 4:1 or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Premature pubic hair development is seen in approximately 15 percent of girls under eight years of age in pediatric office practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Obesity is associated in most, but not all, populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/1,4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,7,8</a>]. Most cases of premature pubarche are due to premature adrenarche (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Premature adrenarche'</a> below), but some cases occur at androgen levels typical of a preschool child; the latter is known as &quot;idiopathic premature pubarche&quot; and likely reflects increased sensitivity to the pilosebaceous unit (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic premature pubarche'</a> below). Therefore, the terms &quot;premature pubarche&quot; and &quot;premature adrenarche&quot; are not synonymous. </p><p>Premature pubarche is unusual before the age of four to five years, but can develop earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Children younger than two years of age with premature pubarche have different clinical and laboratory features compared with older children: they are generally not obese, and their plasma concentrations of DHEAS and androstenedione are increased compared with controls but lower than those of typical premature adrenarche. The premature pubarche in these infants is probably because of a persistent fetal zone of the adrenal gland, hypersensitivity of hair follicles to trace amounts of androgen, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Premature adrenarche</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature adrenarche is a very mild form of hyperandrogenism that is a variant of normal: it causes a slowly progressive incomplete form of premature puberty. The diagnosis requires <strong>biochemical demonstration</strong><em> </em>of a serum steroid pattern indicative of adrenarche before eight years of age in girls, and before nine years in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75217 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The condition is ordinarily detected when a child presents with premature pubarche or other clinical manifestation of androgen action, such as adult-type body odor or acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some investigators use the term to describe biochemical evidence of adrenarche at this age irrespective of clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H508887850\"><span class=\"h3\">Biochemical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature adrenarche is characterized by the following otherwise unexplained biochemical findings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DHEAS</strong> &ndash; The serum concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is the best marker for the presence of adrenarche. Adrenarche is traditionally indicated by a DHEAS level &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;g/dL</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. This cut-off value is above normal for one- to five-year-old (pre-school age) children, and above average for six- to eight-year-old children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79533 \">figure 1</a>). In children with premature adrenarche, DHEAS is typically no higher than 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;g/dL</span> (3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> and no greater than normal for early puberty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other androgens</strong> &ndash; Serum testosterone and androstenedione concentrations typically are in the upper end of the normal range for preschool-aged children. In this age group, the upper limit of the normal range is about 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> for testosterone, and 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> for androstenedione, according to high-specificity radioimmunoassays (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75217 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Serum DHEA may be as high as 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. Other androgen levels are normal or minimally elevated above the range for preschoolers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Response to ACTH stimulation</strong> &ndash; The serum steroid responses to ACTH generally parallel the DHEAS changes during adrenarche or puberty, with rises of 17-hydroxypregnenolone and DHEA predominating (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75217 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53342 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of premature adrenarche is often made in children who have DHEAS levels that are in the adrenarchal range, but in the upper normal range for age (eg, 40 to 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [1.1 to 3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L])</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79533 \">figure 1</a>). If an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is performed in such children, DHEA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 17-hydroxypregnenolone responses are typically increased for age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'ACTH stimulation test'</a> below). The dissociation between DHEAS and DHEA levels may be explicable by heritable determinants of DHEAS levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which may cause individual differences in DHEAS production or clearance due to variations in the activity of sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or sulfatase. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2626258737\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature adrenarche is characterized by the following clinical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical findings</strong> &ndash; Premature adrenarche is usually detected as the basis of premature pubarche. The premature pubarche is often accompanied by an increase in axillary body odor, oily hair or skin (seborrhea), and a minor degree of microcomedonal acne; these may sometimes be the first signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is not accompanied by any other signs of puberty, eg, breast development or testicular enlargement, or frank virilization. The sexual hair development increases slowly, in proportion to linear growth. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical manifestations (eg, premature pubarche) are more common in girls than boys at similar adrenarchal DHEAS levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This has been attributed to sexual dimorphism in androgen metabolism or action.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obesity</strong> &ndash; Because obesity and premature pubarche are both associated with higher DHEAS levels (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal adrenarche&quot;</a>), most studies indicate associations between obesity and premature adrenarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/5,7,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,16,17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Linear growth and bone age</strong> &ndash; Paralleling the trends of androgen levels and obesity, children who have premature adrenarche tend to have a linear growth rate and bone age that are above average, but still within the normal range; their bone age and height age advance proportionately over time. Although the bone age may be significantly advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], it is ordinarily within 20 percent of height age, and predicted adult height is normal for the family target height (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Bone age'</a> below). Bone mineral density is slightly increased independent of bone age, and fat-free mass is unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exaggerated adrenarche</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exaggerated adrenarche is a clinically extreme type of premature adrenarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This variant is suggested in children with premature adrenarche who have clinical features that suggest an atypical degree of androgen excess (eg, slightly increased linear growth rate that leads to a gradual rise in height percentile and modestly advanced bone age) or insulin resistance (eg, central adiposity or acanthosis nigricans). This term has been applied when the baseline DHEAS or androstenedione level, or the response of 17-hydroxypregnenolone or DHEA to stimulation with ACTH, is above normal for age or for early puberty. Serum DHEAS levels up to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> and serum testosterone up to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (the upper limits of normal for an early pubertal girl) are consistent with the exaggerated adrenarche variant of premature adrenarche. However, virilizing disorders should be excluded in girls with the clinical picture of exaggerated adrenarche and these latter atypically high androgen levels. (See <a href=\"#H2485576\" class=\"local\">'Virilizing disorders'</a> below.) </p><p>While the bone age advancement associated with exaggerated adrenarche may be associated with a slightly advanced onset of true puberty in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], this is not necessarily the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Height potential does not seem to be compromised unless there is a congenital or hereditary reason for short stature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of premature adrenarche is unclear. The traditional concept is that it is an extreme variant of normal development (ie, &quot;normal adrenarche occurring early&quot;). Some cases are familial; however, no convincing genetic basis has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is commonly assumed that the process is caused by premature development of the adrenal zona reticularis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal adrenarche&quot;</a>). If this concept is correct, premature adrenarche would have no long-term consequences. However, a number of observations suggest that premature adrenarche may sometimes indicate or be a risk factor for a pathologic entity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associations of the syndrome with temporal lobe lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and poliomyelitic scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] have led to speculation that adrenal androgen-stimulating factor (or zona reticularis growth factor) is controlled by neural pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature adrenarche is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as insulin resistance that in some reports is disproportionate to obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/7,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,16</a>]. This suggests that premature adrenarche may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies suggest that low birth weight, whether or not appropriate for gestational age, predisposes to premature adrenarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10,17,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,23,24</a>]. However, the association of premature adrenarche with low birth weight is not uniformly found across populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25,26</a>]. Consistent with the &quot;thrifty phenotype hypothesis&quot; (also known as &quot;metabolic programming&quot;), some of these studies suggest this relationship of low birth weight to premature adrenarche is mediated by subsequent obesity, particularly when associated with rapid early childhood weight gain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Metabolic programming'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the clinical studies cited above, animal experiments support the hypothesis of in utero epigenetic programming of adrenal androgenic function. Prenatal androgenization of female rhesus monkeys has been reported to induce functional adrenal hyperandrogenism along with other features of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls seem to be at moderately increased risk for developing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk seems to be greatest in the subgroup with exaggerated adrenarche. These observations suggest that premature adrenarche may be an early manifestation of the steroidogenic dysregulation that will cause persistent functional hyperandrogenism of the adrenal glands and ovaries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterozygosity for congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be a risk factor for premature adrenarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF PREMATURE PUBARCHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature pubarche is usually due to premature adrenarche. However, several other causes of premature pubarche must be considered, the most serious being hyperandrogenic disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2485518\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrichosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature pubarche must be distinguished from hypertrichosis. Fine hair appearing in the genital area is often a manifestation of a generalized excess of body hair (hypertrichosis), rather than the initial stage (Tanner stage 2) of sexual hair development. Hypertrichosis is the term for the generalized excessive growth of vellus body hair that thus appears in both nonsexual and sexual areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It is most commonly familial or caused by metabolic disorders (eg, thyroid disturbances, anorexia nervosa, porphyria) or medications (Dilantin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a>). Pubic hair in a young child that is similar in characteristics and degree to forearm hair is typically due to hypertrichosis, not adrenarche. It is not caused by excess androgen, although hyperandrogenemia may aggravate it. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic premature pubarche</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic premature pubarche is a term applied to children who have premature pubarche but no biochemical evidence of adrenarche (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79533 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In other words, bone age, DHEAS, and other plasma androgens are normal for pre-school children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-adrenarche#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal adrenarche&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations of adrenarche'</a>.).</p><p>Idiopathic premature pubarche presumably reflects increased sensitivity of the pilosebaceous unit to trace adrenarchal androgen concentrations. This may be due to increased androgen receptor gene activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. This is analogous to idiopathic hirsutism in adults, in which increased sexual hair growth occurs in the absence of hyperandrogenemia. Indeed, our personal experience suggests idiopathic premature pubarche may be a risk factor for idiopathic hirsutism in some individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2485538\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (also known as &quot;central,&quot; &quot;complete,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; precocious puberty) is another condition characterized by the premature appearance of pubic hair. However, it is typically preceded by the cardinal antecedent signs of precocious puberty (ie, testicular enlargement in boys and breast development in girls). True precocious puberty is accompanied by premature adrenarche in about half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Familial isolated luteinizing hormone (LH) excess was reported to cause mild virilization with isolated premature pubarche in a 1.5-year-old boy and his four-year-old sister [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2485576\"><span class=\"h2\">Virilizing disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature pubic hair development may be the initial manifestation of a virilizing disorder. Other than true sexual precocity in boys, virilizing disorders are gonadotropin-independent. They are unusual, accounting for less than 5 percent of premature pubarche, but their progressive nature requires vigilance. </p><p>Frankly virilizing disorders, such as classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are suggested by the rapid progression of sexual hair development, acne that requires drug treatment, a growth spurt, increasing musculature, lowering of the voice, and, in girls, clitoromegaly (accompanied by genital ambiguity when the virilization commences in early fetal life, as in classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Serum testosterone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DHEAS concentrations are well above the normal adrenarchal range. A serum testosterone level above that of normal females should be considered frankly virilizing in a young child. This degree of androgen excess causes the bone age to progressively advance disproportionately to linear growth. Affected children typically present with a significantly advanced bone age (&gt;2.0 SD for age and also &gt;20 percent above height age) unless the disorder is of very recent onset.

It is important that the radiograph be interpreted by a physician trained and experienced in this technique, such as a pediatric endocrinologist or pediatric radiologist. If the bone age is normal (ie, within 2 SD of average), predicted adult height is ordinarily normal, and a serious cause for precocious pubarche is unlikely. Predicted adult height is typically calculated from the height and bone age by the method of Bayley and Pinneau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In children too young to apply the Bayley-Pinneau tables, the appropriateness of bone age for height is indicated by the ratio of bone age to height age, which is the chronologic age for which the child's height would be average, approximating 1.0.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging permit better visualization and more detailed assessment of tumors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF PREMATURE ADRENARCHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the initial evaluation leads to the diagnosis of premature adrenarche, it is important to reexamine the patient and repeat the bone age in six months to rule out a virilizing disorder of recent onset. If progression of symptoms remain minimal and height prediction remains stable, these children can be reassessed at longer intervals thereafter for the possibility of a mild virilizing disorder.</p><p>Premature adrenarche requires no specific endocrine treatment, since this is a benign condition in children. Patients and their parents should be informed that the condition is ordinarily an extreme variation of normal due to inordinate sensitivity of the hair follicles to normal trace amounts of male hormone in children, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a normal incomplete form of puberty that is occurring early and is only occasionally followed by other pubertal abnormalities.</p><p>Deodorants can be used, and pubic hairs may be shaved or clipped. Counseling about a diet and exercise program is indicated for obesity and metabolic syndrome, if present. In addition, the parents should be evaluated for type 2 diabetes if there is a family history of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To validate the initial presumptive diagnosis, these patients should undergo long-term re-evaluation for evidence of virilization. This is indicated because the bone age interpretation and the accuracy of testosterone levels are often problematic. Moreover, in patients with rare disorders of steroid metabolism (eg, cortisone reductase deficiency, apparent dehydroepiandrosterone&nbsp;[DHEA] sulfotransferase deficiency), initial hormonal measurements may be atypical, but insufficient to establish a diagnosis. &#160; </p><p>Girls with premature pubarche and low levels of executive functioning may be psychosocially vulnerable because of the mismatch between their physical development and their cognitive and emotional resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Girls with premature pubarche appear to carry about a 15 to 20 percent risk of developing PCOS. It is possible that the risk is higher in those with exaggerated adrenarche, and relatively low in those with ordinary premature adrenarche (DHEAS 40 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> or in idiopathic premature pubarche (DHEAS &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/premature-adrenarche/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Premature adrenarche may occasionally be a harbinger of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome in adulthood; this is particularly the case in girls who are coincidentally obese. Patients with premature adrenarche should be followed regularly after true puberty occurs. The parents should be told of these possibilities, but that there is no way of predicting if they will occur. They should also be told that these disorders are treatable, should they occur, and may be preventable or delayed by maintaining physical fitness and a healthy body weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

It is more common in girls. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Premature pubarche'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature adrenarche is the most common cause of premature pubarche. It is the term applied to otherwise unexplained, slowly progressive, premature pubarche that is associated with a serum steroid pattern indicative of adrenarche, including a dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate DHEAS level over 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>. Typically, the DHEAS and testosterone levels are no greater than normal for early female puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89151\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89151 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75217 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Premature adrenarche'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other more serious causes of premature pubarche include complete precocious puberty and virilizing disorders, including nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, exogenous exposure to androgens, and rarely, virilizing tumors. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of premature pubarche'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children presenting with premature pubarche should be carefully examined for breast and genital development. The child's height and amount of pubic hair should be recorded for future comparison, and the bone age determined. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of premature pubarche'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with an unusual amount of sexual hair, evidence of true pubertal development (breast development in girls, testicular enlargement in boys), or significantly advanced bone age should undergo further evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89151\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89151 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal measurements at baseline'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'ACTH stimulation test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Dexamethasone androgen-suppression test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature adrenarche is generally benign but is associated with moderately increased risks for polycystic ovary syndrome, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in adulthood.
