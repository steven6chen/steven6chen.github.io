It encompasses fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, sometimes called neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95001\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95001 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H164265880\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The roles of the primary care provider in the management of FASD include early identification and provision of education, anticipatory guidance, family support, and a medical home. (See <a href=\"#H164266893\" class=\"local\">'Role of the primary care provider'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions for FASD usually are individualized according to the strengths and needs of the patient and his or her family. Most individuals with FASD benefit from multiple types of intervention (eg, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, etc). (See <a href=\"#H164264825\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General strategies that parents and caregivers can implement to improve behavior of children with FASD include (see <a href=\"#H164264844\" class=\"local\">'General recommendations'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increasing the predictability and structure of the environment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using visual prompts and sequences to reinforce and remind children how to perform activities of daily living</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Developing behavior plans built on positive reinforcement and healthy discipline strategies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simplifying the environment (eg, avoiding multi-step commands, reducing distractions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific interventions may be used to target academic, executive <span class=\"nowrap\">function/self-regulation,</span> social, and adaptive skills. Parent training may be helpful in reducing behavior problems. (See <a href=\"#H342651777\" class=\"local\">'Targeted interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with FASD are at increased risk for adverse outcomes including school problems (eg, suspension, expulsion, dropping out), trouble with the law, incarceration, homelessness, unemployment, substance use disorder, chronic mental health problems, and premature death. Diagnosis before age six years, receipt of social and educational services, and a stable and nurturing living environment are associated with improved outcomes.
