Even among patients with nonazotemic cirrhosis, those with a greater degree of neurohumoral activation show diminished diuretic responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The development of diuretic resistance in a previously diuretic-sensitive patient is most often due to progression of the liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, it can also be due to two other complications of cirrhosis: hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein thrombosis (either bland clot or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma). A computed tomography (CT) scan and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein can help diagnose or exclude these complications. A liver and spleen ultrasound with Doppler can be performed, but is much less sensitive in detecting tumor than CT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H57741474\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Progression to diuretic-resistance is generally an irreversible process unless there is a reversible component to the liver disease (eg, alcoholic hepatitis) or the patient undergoes successful liver transplantation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) placement, or peritoneovenous shunt creation. As urinary sodium excretion dwindles despite diuretics, progressive azotemia and electrolyte imbalances (eg, hyponatremia) are expected. Diuretics are generally discontinued in such patients.</p><p>It is important to note that diuretics do <strong>not</strong> cause hepatorenal syndrome. This association may be inappropriately suggested because most patients are taking diuretics when hepatorenal syndrome is diagnosed. On the other hand, diuretics can cause azotemia, particularly if fluid is removed too rapidly in patients without peripheral edema. Diuretic-induced azotemia improves with the cessation of therapy and fluid repletion. By comparison, hepatorenal syndrome typically worsens inexorably (unless effective treatment is initiated), even after diuretics are stopped.

The 78 mEq of sodium cutoff reflects the recommended 88 mEq intake minus 10 mEq in non-urinary losses. Patients who are diuretic sensitive will excrete &ge;78 mEq of sodium per day because of the diuretic.

Measurement of urinary creatinine is usually helpful in estimating the completeness of the collection. Men with cirrhosis and a stable serum creatinine concentration should excrete &gt;15 mg of creatinine per kg of body weight per day, and women should excrete &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, some patients with advanced cirrhosis have muscle wasting and lower rates of creatinine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In such patients, it may be difficult to use creatinine excretion as a marker of the completeness of the collection. </p><p>There is evidence that a random urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/potassium</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Na/K)</span> ratio may be almost as good as a 24-hour collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In the absence of diuretic therapy, patients with ascites have a very low urine sodium concentration and a high urine potassium concentration due to secondary hyperaldosteronism. One study found that approximately 90 percent of patients with a urine <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/K</span> ratio &gt;1 in a random specimen excreted more than 78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> in a 24-hour urine collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

These disorders are typically refractory to diuretic therapy because of an inability to mobilize the ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. By contrast, massive hepatic metastasis, another cause of malignant ascites, is due to intrahepatic portal hypertension and can be treated in a similar fashion to patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>To differentiate diuretic-resistant ascites from these other entities, patients should undergo paracentesis with ascitic fluid analysis (assessment of appearance and measurement of triglyceride content if opalescent or milky, fluid cell count and differential, fluid total protein, and serum-ascites albumin gradient), as well as abdominal ultrasound with Doppler imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites#H64023967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;, section on 'Initial ascitic fluid tests'</a>.)</p><p>Another form of diuretic-resistant ascites, called nephrogenic ascites, occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease who are usually being treated with maintenance dialysis. The pathogenesis of this disorder, which is usually <strong>not</strong> due to liver disease or portal hypertension, may be related to an increase in peritoneal capillary permeability induced in part by inadequate dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The serum-ascites albumin gradient is &lt;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> consistent with the absence of portal hypertension unless the patient has cirrhosis or heart failure in addition to their renal failure. Some patients respond to more intensive dialysis, but definitive therapy is renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1323127675\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the treatment of patients who appear to have diuretic-resistant ascites is to stop medications that decrease systemic blood pressure (and thus renal perfusion), such as beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARBs). It may be particularly important to discontinue beta blockers because their use in patients with diuretic-resistant ascites has been associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should also be discontinued because they can cause renal vasoconstriction. In patients who continue to have diuretic resistance despite the interventions, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a>, a vasopressor, may be effective. We start with 5 mg orally three times daily and adjust the dose (by increments of 2.5 mg for each dose) every 24 hours (maximal dose 17.5 mg three times daily) to achieve an increase in systolic blood pressure of approximately 10 to 15 mmHg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16347033\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuation of sodium restriction and when to discontinue diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with diuretic-resistant ascites should continue to follow a low-sodium diet (88 mEq [2000 mg] per day), though diuretics should be discontinued if the urine sodium is &lt;30 mEq per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1323127682\"><span class=\"h2\">Discontinuing beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonselective beta blockers are used routinely to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices, but they have the potential to reduce renal perfusion in patients who already have compromised renal perfusion, leading to decreased natriuresis. In addition, some studies suggest they are associated with increased mortality rates in patients with diuretic-resistant ascites and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This increase in mortality may occur because failure to maintain an adequate mean arterial blood pressure is strongly correlated with survival in patients with advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Based on the available data and our own experience, we do not initiate beta blockers (or we discontinue them if already part of the patient's regimen) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diuretic-resistant ascites. Preliminary data suggest that it is safe to abruptly discontinue beta blockers, with no adverse effects on the hepatic venous pressure gradient, though there is a slight increase in the cardiac index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If these patients require primary or secondary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding, we prefer variceal banding.

In some patients, if the patient's blood pressure and azotemia improve off the beta blocker, it can be restarted cautiously with careful monitoring of blood pressure (including in home monitoring) and renal function. However, among patients with SBP, we discontinue the beta blocker permanently. To continue it increases risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The available studies suggest that beta blocker use in patients with diuretic-resistant ascites may be harmful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational study of 151 patients with diuretic-resistant ascites found that patients who received nonselective beta blockers had worse survival compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Median survival was significantly longer in patients who did not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> versus those who did (20 versus 5 months). Independent predictors of mortality were Child-Pugh class C, hyponatremia, refractory ascites due to renal failure, and beta blocker therapy. Whether the beta blockers accounted for the increased mortality is unclear, since the study was not randomized. In particular, patients who did not receive beta blockers appeared to be less likely to have varices and to be sicker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, approximately two-thirds of the deaths in patients taking beta blockers were due to hepatocellular cancer or sepsis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A crossover trial looked at 10 patients with diuretic-resistant ascites who were undergoing paracentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction developed in 8 of 10 patients when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> was given prior to paracentesis. However, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was seen in only 1 of 10 patients when propranolol was not given.</p><p/><p>In our experience, patients with diuretic-resistant ascites or other signs of hepatic decompensation (eg, hepatic encephalopathy) do not tolerate beta blockers well. We typically restrict the use of beta blockers to patients with compensated cirrhosis and large esophageal varices who require primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding and are not being managed with variceal ligation. Occasionally, we will use beta blockers as secondary prophylaxis in combination with variceal banding in patients who have had variceal bleeding (and no other evidence of hepatic decompensation), but we have a low threshold to discontinue them. Our banding approach is aggressive (12 to 16 bands on the first session, 5 to 8 on the second, and 0 to 3 on the third, followed by an upper endoscopy and banding as needed every three to six months). Our impression is that less aggressive banding regimens increase the risk of rebleeding between sessions, though our approach has not been formally compared with other approaches.

Survival in patients with cirrhosis and ascites is dependent on mean arterial pressure (MAP) with a cut-point of 82 mm Hg; those with MAP &gt;82 mm Hg have a 70 percent chance of surviving two years, whereas those with a MAP &lt;82 mm Hg have only a 20 percent 2-year-survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The progressive decrease in systemic blood pressure is associated with reductions in renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate and increases in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In addition, we discontinue beta blockers in patients who present with SBP, bleeding, azotemia, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or hypotension. If the patient's blood pressure and azotemia improve off the beta blocker, it can be restarted cautiously with careful monitoring of blood pressure (including in home monitoring) and renal function. However, among patients with SBP, we discontinue the beta blocker permanently. Other medications to avoid include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and NSAIDS.
