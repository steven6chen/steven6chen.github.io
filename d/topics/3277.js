The antiemetic drugs are classified according to their primary action; some agents affect multiple receptors.</p><p>Five neurotransmitter receptor sites are of primary importance in the vomiting reflex:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1 &ndash; muscarinic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D2 &ndash; dopamine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H1 &ndash; histamine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)-3 &ndash; serotonin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor &ndash; substance P</p><p/><p>The area postrema is an important site for M1, D2, 5-HT3, and NK1 receptors, although other central and peripheral sites play a role, including H1 receptors in the vestibular nucleus and 5-HT3 receptors on vagal afferent neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A review of the pathogenesis of vomiting is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the frequent occurrence of nausea and vomiting, there are relatively few published studies that compare some of the common antiemetic drugs in specific disorders. Thus, drug selection in many clinical situations is based upon empiricism, the preferred route of administration, and safety. Therapy has been most extensively evaluated in chemotherapy-induced emesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and prediction of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The available antiemetic drugs will be reviewed here, using a classification system based upon their site of action.

Typical dose regimens are 5 to 10 mg PO every six to eight hours, 5 to 10 mg IM or 2.5 to 10 mg IV every three to four hours, or 25 mg by rectal suppository every 12 hours.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorpromazine</a> is used less often than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>; the dose of this drug is 10 to 25 mg PO every four to six hours, 25 mg IV every three to four hours, or 100 mg rectally every six to eight hours. Thiethylperazine is another alternative; it is given at a dose of 10 mg PO or 2 mg IM every 8 to 24 hours.</p><p>The main adverse effects of the phenothiazines are extrapyramidal reactions such as dystonia and, with prolonged use, tardive dyskinesia. Acute dystonia can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> 25 to 50 mg IV or IM.

It also stimulates cholinergic receptors on gastric smooth muscle cells and enhances acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. </p><p>The side effects associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> include central side effects of anxiety, restlessness, and depression, hyperprolactinemia, and QT interval prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Metoclopramide has a black box warning from the US Food and Drug Administration related to risks of irreversible tardive dyskinesia with higher dosing and long-term use.

However, it has largely been replaced by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists due to their superior efficacy and safety. Metoclopramide crosses the blood-brain barrier. Thus, it commonly causes neurologic side effects such as akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, especially in the elderly and at high doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Metoclopramide is primarily used at present as an adjunctive agent for the prevention of cisplatin-induced delayed emesis and with emesis failing first-line treatment.</p><p>Two other benzamides are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethobenzamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethobenzamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a>. Trimethobenzamide can be given at doses of 250 mg PO every six to eight hours or 200 mg IM. However, this agent was no better than placebo in one study of patients with a variety of illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and was only mildly effective in patients receiving chemotherapy in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prochlorperazine</a> was more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Domperidone</a> is a D2-blocker with selective peripheral activity in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The major advantage of this drug is that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore lacks the neurologic side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>.

Chemotherapy drugs are classified according to the associated risk of emesis and antiemetic therapy is individualized according to that risk.

Some data suggest potential value of these drugs for treatment of chemotherapy-induced delayed emesis associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Four 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are currently approved in the United States: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granisetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">granisetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolasetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolasetron</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palonosetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palonosetron</a>. Several well-conducted, randomized, comparative trials have failed to demonstrate any convincing difference in efficacy or tolerability between the three first-generation agents (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron) when used at effective doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Palonosetron differs from the other three in having both a higher receptor binding affinity and much longer half-life. Phase III trials of single agent palonosetron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and palonosetron combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] demonstrated superiority to first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the prevention of delayed as well as acute emesis.

Furthermore, repetitive dosing is not superior to a single dose given immediately before chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The recommended prophylactic regimen for the most emetogenic chemotherapy consists of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist.

Asthenia and constipation occur in 5 to 10 percent, and dizziness occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients treated intravenously and in 5 percent of those receiving the oral formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Electrocardiogram (ECG) interval changes are a class effect of the first-generation 5-HT3 antagonists, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granisetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">granisetron</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolasetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolasetron</a>.

It is predominantly used as prophylaxis against motion sickness. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anticholinergic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antihistamines are primarily used for motion sickness. Available agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimenhydrinate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meclizine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a>. Sedation is a common side effect with any of these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antihistamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenothiazines were the first group of drugs to demonstrate substantial activity in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prochlorperazine</a> is the most commonly used antiemetic in this class. The main adverse effects of the phenothiazines are extrapyramidal reactions such as dystonia, and with prolonged use, tardive dyskinesia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Phenothiazines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Butyrophenones are major tranquilizers that potentiate the actions of opioids and have an antiemetic effect when used alone. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Droperidol</a> is a short-acting drug, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> has a considerably longer half-life (about 18 hours), which limits its use. The side effect profile and antiemetic efficacy of the butyrophenones appear to be similar to those of the phenothiazines. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Butyrophenones'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> is a benzamide that causes central and peripheral dopamine D2 antagonism at low doses, and weak 5-HT3 blockade at the higher doses used for emesis caused by cytotoxic drug therapy. It also stimulates cholinergic receptors on gastric smooth muscle cells and enhances acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. At standard doses, metoclopramide has a modest antiemetic effect. However, it has been associated with irreversible tardive dyskinesia. <br/><br/>Two other benzamides are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethobenzamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethobenzamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a>. The major advantage of domperidone is that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore lacks the neurologic side effects of metoclopramide. It is available in the United States only through an investigational new drug program. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Benzamides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serotonin antagonists form the cornerstone of therapy for the control of acute emesis with chemotherapy agents with moderate to high emetogenic potential.

They are used in combination with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and a glucocorticoid, typically for patients receiving highly emetic chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids are effective and well-tolerated antiemetics for chemotherapy-induced emesis. Their mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Insomnia, increased energy, and mood changes are common side effects. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannabinoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabilone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a>) have been used for nausea related to chemotherapy.
