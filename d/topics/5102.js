People with diabetes have a higher chance of getting certain infections. Doctors think this is likely due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood sugar &ndash; Blood sugar levels that are too high can keep a person's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;) from working as well as it should.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage &ndash; Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage. This can lead to problems. For example, nerve damage can make people unable to feel pain in their feet. So if a person gets a cut on the foot or steps on a nail or other sharp object that pierces the skin, he or she might not know it. If a wound isn't treated right away, it can become an open sore and get infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood vessel problems &ndash; Over time, diabetes can damage the blood vessels. Then blood can't flow as well to help heal an infection.</p><p/><p>It's important that people with diabetes let their doctor or nurse know right away if they think they have an infection. That's because people with diabetes who get an infection are more likely to get a serious condition called &quot;diabetic ketoacidosis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209968282\"><span class=\"h1\">What kinds of infections do people with diabetes commonly get?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with diabetes commonly get:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal yeast infections (in women)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder or kidney infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections on the feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yeast infections in the mouth (called &quot;thrush&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections after surgery, around the cut from the surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209968297\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain symptoms might mean you have an infection. Call your doctor or nurse if you have diabetes and get any of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, aches, or chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, swelling, warmth, or increased pain around a cut or scrape, or pus draining from a cut or scrape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling the need to urinate a lot, having pain when you urinate, or having cloudy or bad-smelling urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal itching or discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White patches in your mouth or on your tongue</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209968312\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help prevent infections?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People with diabetes can do different things to help prevent infections. One of the most important things you can do is keep your blood sugar level under control. Controlling your blood sugar can help reduce nerve and blood vessel damage from diabetes.</p><p>Another important thing you can do is take good care of your feet. This can help prevent foot infections. To protect and take care of your feet, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes or slippers all the time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trim your toe nails carefully. Cut straight across and file the nail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80053 \">figure 1</a>). Do not cut cuticles or pop blisters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your feet with warm water and soap every day and pat them dry. Put a moisturizing cream or lotion on your feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check both feet every day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77032 \">figure 2</a>). Look for cuts, blisters, swelling, or redness. Make sure to check all over your feet, including the bottoms of your feet and in between your toes. If you can't see well or if you have trouble seeing the bottoms of your feet, ask a family member or friend to check your feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear socks that are not too tight, and change them every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes that fit well, and are not too tight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check inside your shoes before you put them on. Make sure there is nothing sharp inside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your doctor check your feet at each visit.</p><p/><p>To help prevent infections in other parts of your body, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care of your skin by keeping it clean and dry. Wear gloves when you use harsh cleaning chemicals or other products that could harm your skin. If you get a cut or scrape, wash it right away with soap and water. If it doesn't heal or gets worse, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care of your gums and teeth. Brush your teeth twice a day, floss your teeth every day, and see your dentist for regular check-ups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes protein, vegetables, and fruits. Drink plenty of fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the pneumonia vaccine, the flu vaccine (every year), and any other vaccines your doctor recommends.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often, especially if you are around people who are sick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid holding in your urine for very long periods of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. Smoking makes blood vessel problems worse.</p><p/><p>If you do get an infection and your doctor prescribes antibiotic medicines, be sure to take them exactly as prescribed. If you don't take all of your antibiotics, your infection could come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H209968421\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic ketoacidosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvovaginal-yeast-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvovaginal yeast infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=keeping-your-childs-blood-sugar-under-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Keeping your child's blood sugar under control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-childs-blood-sugar-level-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your child's blood sugar level (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-damage-caused-by-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nerve damage caused by diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrush-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thrush (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-cuts-and-scrapes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of cuts and scrapes (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetic neuropathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-care-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Foot care in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-infection-pyelonephritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
