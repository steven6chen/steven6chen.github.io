LGLs comprise 5 percent of the population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, are larger than most circulating lymphocytes, and have characteristic azurophilic granules containing acid hydrolases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69027 \">picture 1</a>). They may be either T cells (T-LGL), the more common type, or natural killer cells (NK-LGL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>LGL leukemia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by peripheral blood and marrow lymphocytic infiltration with LGLs, splenomegaly, and cytopenias, most commonly neutropenia.

In one study of over 1000 patients with RA, the prevalence of neutropenia that could not be attributed to other causes was 1.7 percent; one-third of the patients with neutropenia (0.6 percent of all patients with RA) exhibited LGL proliferation on bone marrow examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The mean age of onset of T-LGL leukemia in RA is 60 years, with no gender differences, which is similar to patients without arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

It appears to represent one part of a spectrum of polyclonal and clonal disorders of LGL, including chronic large granular lymphocytosis, at least a subset of Felty&rsquo;s syndrome (FS), and indolent or more aggressive leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In patients with rheumatologic disease, LGL leukemia is almost always the T-cell LGL (T-LGL) type and tends to have a benign course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The strong association of this disorder with autoimmune disease has led to the postulate that the clonal population may emerge from a polyclonal response to inciting antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Interestingly, it has also been found that T-LGL leukemia is frequently associated with concomitant low-grade B-cell dyscrasias, suggesting the possibility of a common antigen that could drive both T- and B-cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. There is strong evidence that the proliferation of LGL also reflects a failure of Fas-mediated apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-t-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia#H458750948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Several factors appear to contribute to the neutropenia in the LGL syndrome, including defects in both proliferation and neutrophil survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fas-ligand (FasL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, is an important factor in the pathogenesis of neutropenia. FasL is expressed on the surface of activated cytotoxic T cells, and elevated levels of soluble FasL are found in the serum of most patients with LGL leukemia. Soluble FasL has been shown to increase apoptosis of neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. LGLs in the bone marrow may also inhibit myelopoiesis directly by local production of cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Antibody-mediated mechanisms may also contribute to the neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].</p><p>Next generation sequencing studies have identified activating somatic mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene (STAT3) in LGL leukemia patients. Patients with STAT3 mutations were significantly more likely, compared with LGL leukemia patients without the mutations, to have RA and to exhibit neutropenia (26 verus 6 percent and 77 versus 50 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Neutropenia is very common. The following features characterize these patients:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8861808\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RA often precedes the development of T-LGL leukemia, but both conditions may present concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There is a broad range of severity of the arthritis, from mild, intermittent joint swelling to progressive, deforming arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>].

Some patients may also have concomitant anemia or even pancytopenia. Systemic symptoms are usually restricted to infectious symptoms related to neutropenia (see <a href=\"#H8863556\" class=\"local\">'Other symptoms'</a> above). Patients often do not have striking lymphocytosis, nor are atypical lymphocytes a requisite finding. The diagnosis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is based upon the findings of elevated lymphocyte count and marrow infiltration with lymphocytes, a distinctive immunophenotype, and demonstration of clonality by molecular studies.</p><p>LGLs in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis are typically CD3+, CD8+, and <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR-alpha/beta-positive</span> T cells, although some may be CD4+, CD8-, and <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR-gamma/delta-positive</span> T cells. They also frequently express the mature T-cell marker CD57 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Clonality can be confirmed by evaluating for monoclonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor by polymerase chain reaction or by Southern blotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There is no absolute lymphocyte count or number of circulating LGL that is diagnostic.

We obtain consultation with a hematologist for further evaluation, including bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which are usually required to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other causes of neutropenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8862195\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship to Felty's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Felty&rsquo;s syndrome (FS), the triad of chronic arthritis, splenomegaly, and granulocytopenia, typically occurs in patients with severe, longstanding, seropositive RA, often in association with other extraarticular manifestations. Some of these patients have proliferation of LGL, and some patients previously diagnosed with FS would now be classified instead as having T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia, using immunophenotyping techniques and molecular analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,8,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Felty's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between FS and T-LGL leukemia in patients with RA has generally been made based upon the determination of whether the LGL proliferation represents clonal expansion of cells, with those with polyclonality defined as having FS and with those with monoclonality as having LGL-leukemia. However, this distinction is not always clear. Small populations of clonally expanded T cells can be seen healthy individuals and in patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory conditions, suggesting that clonal expansion alone may not always define a population as malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,8,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,22,23</a>].</p><p>The observation that 85 to 90 percent of patients with both FS and RA-associated LGL leukemia are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4-positive suggests a shared or very similar immunologic basis for these conditions and has supported the argument that they represent overlapping parts of a spectrum of conditions, rather than entirely distinct entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. However, patients with FS, compared with patients with LGL leukemia, are more likely to be identified late in their disease course and to be affected by severe RA and other extraarticular manifestations, including leg ulcers and rheumatoid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Only about 40 percent of patients with FS exhibit LGL proliferation.

(See <a href=\"#H24860473\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8862195\" class=\"local\">'Relationship to Felty's syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with RA-associated T-LGL leukemia usually have a chronic, indolent course with a median survival of over 10 years, although most eventually require therapy.
