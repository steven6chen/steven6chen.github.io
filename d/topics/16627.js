(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer#H91192772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p>However, gastric cancer remains a lethal disease. In the United States, approximately 26,240 patients are diagnosed annually, and 10,800 are expected to die from the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Global, country-specific rates of incidence and mortality are available from the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2481\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GLOBOCAN database</a>.</p><p>Prognosis has improved only modestly over the last two decades, attributable to advances in surgical treatment, postoperative care, and multimodality therapy. The high mortality rate reflects the prevalence of advanced disease at presentation and relatively aggressive biology. Early lesions are usually asymptomatic and infrequently detected outside the realm of a screening program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An additional contributing factor to the persistently high mortality rate is the change in the distribution of cancers from the body and antrum to the proximal stomach during the past 20 years. Cancers involving the proximal stomach and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) have increased steadily at a rate exceeding that of any other cancer except melanoma and lung cancer. Aside from a correlation with increasing obesity, the reasons for this are unclear. Proximal lesions are biologically more aggressive and have a worse prognosis, stage for stage, than do distal gastric cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This suggests that their pathogenesis differs from cancers arising in other parts of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer#H91192772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Change in histology pattern'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'Pathobiology'</a>.)</p><p>The classification and management of cancers arising at the EGJ have evolved over time. In the latest, eighth edition of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging manual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], tumors arising at the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers (the so-called Siewert III EGJ tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], see below). However, in contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ. Although implementation of the revised staging tables has been delayed until January 1, 2018 in the United States to allow for the updating of protocols, guidelines, and software, the scientific principles (including the reclassification of the boundary between esophagus and gastric tumors) is valid as of November 2016. Outside of the United States, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) has implemented the eighth edition changes as of January 1, 2017. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on issues related to surgery for cancers arising in the stomach. Surgery may be required as a component of the staging evaluation, for potentially curative treatment of localized disease, or for palliation in cases of advanced disease. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for non-cardia gastric cancers, multimodality approaches for EGJ cancers, and the management of advanced disease are discussed in detail elsewhere.

A major problem is the identification of patients at a time when they are potentially curable. In the United States, two-thirds of patients present with stage III or IV disease, while only 10 percent have stage I disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Mass screening programs have been effective at detecting early gastric cancer in high incidence areas such as Japan where over one-half of patients have early tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The relatively low incidence of <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2481\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">gastric cancer</a> in many other regions including the United States makes this strategy prohibitively costly and unwarranted. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nevertheless, some individuals at high risk for gastric cancer may be appropriate candidates for screening. Specific risk factors for cancer of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction include a genetic predisposition (eg, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, familial polyposis coli, and CDH-1 gene mutation (discussed in more detail elsewhere)), dietary factors, acid hyposecretory conditions, infection with Helicobacter pylori, and Barrett's esophagus. Early evaluation of symptomatic patients may increase the likelihood of finding an early tumor. In one report, early evaluation of symptomatic patients increased the proportion of patients with stage I disease from 4 to 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-cancer-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric cancer screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal therapy depends upon accurate staging of the extent of disease. The preoperative evaluation permits the assessment of a clinical stage, while pathologic staging depends upon the findings at subsequent surgical exploration and examination of the pathologic specimen.</p><p>Complete clinical or preoperative staging of patients with gastric cancer includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination, including evaluation of appropriate nodal areas (especially left supraclavicular nodes) as well as the abdomen and rectal examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) scans of abdomen and pelvis, and for proximal lesions, CT scan of the chest. Although CT is not very accurate for assessing the depth of tumor invasion of the stomach wall or regional nodal involvement, it may detect distant nodal or visceral metastases, ascites, or carcinomatosis. Preoperative CT scans often underestimate the extent of disease, principally because of radiographically undetectable metastases involving the liver and peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Abdominopelvic CT scan'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may provide more accurate staging evaluation of the tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage than CT and also allows for preoperative biopsies. Its principal roles are in the evaluation of a patient being considered for neoadjuvant therapy and to identify tumors that may be amenable to endoscopic mucosal resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staging laparoscopy, while more invasive than CT or EUS, has the advantage of directly visualizing the liver surface, peritoneum, and local lymph nodes, and permitting biopsy of any suspicious lesions. Radiographically occult metastatic disease can be identified, avoiding unnecessary exploratory laparotomy. At laparoscopy, peritoneal metastases are documented in 20 to 30 percent of Western patients with gastric cancer with a negative CT, who would have been otherwise considered potentially resectable. In addition, peritoneal cytology can be obtained during staging laparoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>The selection of patients who need staging laparoscopy is controversial. Some experts suggest restricting staging laparoscopy for patients with EUS stage <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest only that laparoscopy be &quot;considered&quot; for patients who appear to have locoregional disease (other than stage IV, Tis or T1a stage) after conventional radiographic and EUS staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, we believe it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate T2 and T3 lesions on EUS; our practice is to use preoperative staging laparoscopy for any medically fit patient who appears to have more than a T1 lesion on EUS, no histologic confirmation of stage IV disease, and who would not otherwise require a palliative gastrectomy because of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnostic laparoscopy should also be undertaken in patients who are being considered for neoadjuvant therapy trials (eg, those with positive peritoneal cytology).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H977726686\"><span class=\"h3\">Significance of positive peritoneal cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of metastatic disease elsewhere identifies a group of patients who are at particularly high risk for peritoneal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Survival is dismal when gastrectomy is the first line of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>However, opinion differs as to the optimal way to manage such patients, in particular the role of gastrectomy in such patients. At some institutions (including that of the author), patients without overt intraperitoneal metastases but who have positive peritoneal washings are referred for neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and if there is no evidence of progression of disease, chemoradiotherapy) and then restaged to determine whether they converted to negative cytology and are candidates for potentially curative surgery. While the percentage of patients who go on to resection is low, there are occasionally patients who benefit from this approach. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-treatment-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At some (predominantly Asian) institutions, patients with positive peritoneal cytology are considered suitable candidates for peritoneum-directed therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], and at others, these patients are offered only palliative systemic chemotherapy.

In the 2017 revision, tumors involving the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, even if they involve the EGJ, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nodal (N) status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence and number of involved lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic indicators. However, the inadequacy of lymphadenectomy in contemporary North American series of gastric cancer resection is notable, even among patients treated predominantly at academic institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/6,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22-24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Extent of lymph node dissection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal extent of regional node dissection during gastrectomy for gastric cancer is intensely debated. At the core of the debate is the relationship between prognosis and the number of nodes in the surgical specimen. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Extent of lymph node dissection'</a> below.)</p><p>The number of examined nodes influences the accuracy of staging, and influences survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The relationship between number of nodes and outcomes was illustrated in a series of 1038 patients undergoing potentially curative resection for gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The location of positive nodes did not significantly affect median survival, while the number of positive lymph nodes had a profound influence on survival provided that at least 15 lymph nodes were available for analysis. The AJCC staging guidelines recommend that at least 16 regional nodes be assessed pathologically but that <span class=\"nowrap\">removal/evaluation</span> of more nodes (30 or more) is desirable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Regional nodes for tumors involving different parts of the stomach are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111191\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111191 \">figure 1</a>). Involvement of other intraabdominal nodal groups (ie, pancreatoduodenal, retropancreatic, peripancreatic, superior mesenteric, middle colic, paraaortic, and retroperitoneal) is classified as distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR LOCALIZED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical eradication of a gastric tumor with resection of adjacent lymph nodes represents the best chance for long-term survival. Abdominal exploration with curative intent should be undertaken unless there is unequivocal evidence of disseminated disease, major vascular invasion, a neoadjuvant approach is considered, or there are medical contraindications to surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7006444\"><span class=\"h2\">Indicators of unresectability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only widely accepted criteria of unresectability for gastric cancer are the presence of distant metastases, invasion of a major vascular structure, such as the aorta, or disease encasement or occlusion of the hepatic artery or celiac <span class=\"nowrap\">axis/proximal</span> splenic artery. Distal splenic artery involvement is not an indicator of unresectability; the vessel can be resected en bloc with a left upper quadrant exenteration: stomach, spleen, and distal pancreas.</p><p>The lymphatics around the stomach are rich, and the presence of locoregional lymph node metastases that are located geographically distant from the tumor (eg, celiac nodes with a primary tumor on the greater curvature of the stomach) should not necessarily be considered an indicator of unresectability (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nodal (N) status'</a> above). However:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have bulky adenopathy fixed to the pancreatic head that might indicate the need for a Whipple procedure are at a high risk for occult metastatic disease. In these cases, it is probably best to consider staging laparoscopy or upfront chemotherapy rather than surgery initially. Performance of a Whipple for gastric cancer is an extremely rare occurrence. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Staging laparoscopy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph nodes behind or inferior to the pancreas, aorto-caval region, into the mediastinum, or in the porta hepatis are typically considered outside of the surgical field and thus evidence of unresectability. These nodes would fall into areas that would be defined as third or fourth echelon nodes in the Japanese nomenclature.</p><p/><p>Since resection of the primary lesion also offers the most effective means of symptom palliation, exploration may also be considered in patients with known metastatic disease, if the severity of symptoms so dictates. The choice of operation for gastric cancer depends upon the location of the tumor within the stomach, the clinical stage, and the histologic type. The major surgical considerations include the extent of stomach resection (total versus partial gastrectomy) and the extent of lymph node dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7006295\"><span class=\"h3\">Linitis plastica</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In about 5 percent of primary gastric cancers, a broad region of the gastric wall or even the entire stomach is extensively infiltrated by malignancy, resulting in a rigid thickened stomach, termed linitis plastica. The prevalence may be higher in younger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. Although most commonly due to poorly-differentiated (diffuse-type) infiltrating gastric cancers, this pattern can, in rare circumstances, represent metastatic spread from lobular cancer of the breast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Diffuse type cancers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Linitis plastica has an extremely poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>], and this is attributed to the potential for early spread and advanced stage at diagnosis, as well as the frequent presence of microscopic disease at the surgical margins because of its diffuse nature. In one report, one-half of all patients had metastatic disease (mainly within the peritoneal cavity) at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Nodal involvement is frequent, and extensive surgery may be required for complete excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. Many surgeons consider the presence of linitis plastica to be a contraindication to potentially curative resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

This trial relied heavily upon input from a Japanese surgeon, who trained 11 Dutch surgeons in the technique of radical lymph node dissection and monitored the operative procedures. Despite these efforts to maintain quality control of the surgical procedures, both under removal and over removal of required nodal stations occurred, somewhat blurring the distinction between the groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both postoperative morbidity (43 versus 25 percent) and mortality (10 versus 4 percent) were higher in the D2 group, and a statistically significant survival advantage in the radical dissection group was not observed, either in the initial report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] or with longer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/60,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,67</a>], despite a significantly lower risk of recurrence.

The survival curves have continued to separate, although the difference in overall survival is still not statistically significant (22 versus 28 percent in the D1 and D2 arms, respectively, p = 0.34). However, the gastric cancer-related death rate is significantly higher in the D1 arm (48 versus 37 percent), while death rates due to other causes were not different.

In high-volume, experienced centers, however, laparoscopic gastric resection provides an alternative that offers patients a faster recovery and fewer complications while recovering a similar number of lymph nodes compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/85-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-92</a>].</p><p>The best contemporary evidence for the short-term advantages of laparoscopic, as compared to open, gastric surgery in prospective randomized trials includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic gastrectomy is most commonly performed for early gastric cancers (defined as invasive gastric cancer that invades no more deeply than the submucosa) in patients who are not candidates for endoscopic resection. In the largest randomized trial, which included 1416 patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a>) in Korea, laparoscopic distal gastrectomy resulted in lower wound (3.1 versus 7.7 percent), intraabdominal (7.6 versus 10.3 percent), and overall (13 versus 20 percent) complication rates compared with open distal gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

In a multicenter trial conducted in China, 1056 patients with clinical stage T2-4a, N0-3, M0 gastric cancer were randomly assigned to laparoscopic or open distal gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Patients treated with laparoscopic or open surgery had similar postoperative mortality (0.4 versus 0 percent) and morbidity rates (15 versus 13 percent), similar severity of morbidities, and similar completion rates of a D2 lymphadenectomy (99.4 versus 99.6 percent). The follow-up is not yet long enough for meaningful reporting of oncologic outcomes. The results of this trial, however, may not be extrapolative to the West, where surgeon experiences and patient populations are different. As examples, the average age (56.5 years) and body mass index (BMI; 22.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> of the patients included in this trial differ from the generally older and more obese population in the West; the proportion of cases with well-differentiated histology (approximately 70 percent) is higher than that in most Western series. Additionally, the inclusion criteria did not state the most proximal extent of tumors allowed in the study.</p><p/><p>Although many trials have demonstrated the technical feasibility and short-term advantages of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery, few have reported on long-term oncologic outcomes (ie, survival and cancer recurrence rates). To fill in this evidence gap, a large case-control study, the LOC-1 study, analyzed 1848 patients who underwent open or laparoscopic gastrectomy for <strong>stage I</strong> gastric cancer and who were propensity score matched across 30 variables that could influence the outcomes of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In the matched study population, the five-year overall survival (96.3 percent open, 97.1 percent laparoscopic), three-year recurrence-free survival (97.4 versus 97.7 percent), and recurrence rate (2.4 versus 2.3 percent) were all comparable between the open and laparoscopic groups. </p><p>In a meta-analysis that included mostly retrospective studies comparing outcomes among patients who underwent laparoscopic or open gastric cancer surgery for resectable gastric cancer of all stages, five-year rates of overall survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% CI 0.90-1.28), recurrence-free survival (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68-1.02), and disease-specific survival (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65-1.13) were not significantly different with laparoscopic as compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>However, long-term oncologic data from prospective randomized trials are not expected for another several years but are required before laparoscopic surgery can be considered oncologically equivalent to open surgery in treating invasive gastric cancer.</p><p>Techniques of open and laparoscopic gastrectomy are discussed in separate topic reviews.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been proposed in this setting to identify those patients undergoing surgical rather than endoscopic management who need more extensive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. At least in theory, patients with positive SLNs should undergo partial or total gastrectomy with requisite D2 lymphadenectomy while those with a negative SLN biopsy are recommended for a more limited gastric (eg, wedge or segmental) resection with a D1 or no formal lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. However, the available data on the accuracy of SLN mapping for early gastric cancer are conflicting, and in our view, the use of SLN mapping for early gastric cancer remains investigational and should be limited to clinical trials.

Overall, 13 of 28 patients with lymph node metastasis were not identified by SLN biopsy, resulting in a false negative rate of 46 percent. Seven of these 13 patients had nodal metastases outside the lymphatic basin that was resected after SLN mapping (skip metastasis).</p><p/><p>Two earlier meta-analyses also cautioned against routine use of SLN biopsy in treating early gastric cancer because of its relative low sensitivity for detection of LN metastases (77 to 88 percent) and high levels of heterogeneity between surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].

Finally, there is a profound difference between gastric cancer and two other cancers for which SLN has become an accepted strategy (breast cancer, melanoma), in that if the final pathology differs from that seen on intraoperative frozen section analysis, reoperation is a much bigger operation for gastric cancer and is associated with greater risks to the patient. For all of these reasons the use of SLN mapping for early gastric cancer remains investigational at best and should be limited to clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>].

Although postoperative chemoradiotherapy is more commonly used in the United States, results from several well-conducted international trials have led to the adoption of perioperative (neoadjuvant plus postoperative) chemotherapy approach to treatment of potentially resectable gastric and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer in much of Europe and other parts of the world.

Similarly, in the MAGIC trial of induction chemotherapy versus surgery alone, only 66 percent of the patients who underwent surgery were able to begin postoperative chemotherapy and approximately 40 percent of patients completed all therapy (despite a permissible delay of up to 12 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

If there is no evidence of extragastric progression, they then receive five weeks of chemoradiotherapy followed by a five-week rest period and a formal restaging evaluation (including a repeat laparoscopy with peritoneal washings). Patients with no evidence of metastatic disease who convert to negative cytology are considered eligible for potentially curative surgery since a small number can achieve long-term disease-specific survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/108-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">108-111</a>].

In a series of 60 patients (seen over a thirty-year period) who underwent an attempted resection for recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal cancer, 29 were resectable at laparotomy, 14 of whom required adjacent organ resection, and 6, interposition grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. Median overall survival for patients undergoing resection was 26 months, compared with six months for unresectable patients.</p><p>While these results suggest that salvage surgery may contribute to prolonged survival, the opportunity to resect recurrent gastric tumors is infrequent at best. This approach should be restricted to highly selected fit patients with an isolated local recurrence and no evidence of distant spread.</p><p>Rather than surgery, most such patients are offered systemic chemotherapy for palliation of symptoms. Occasionally, local palliative procedures, such as radiotherapy (in patients not previously having received radiotherapy at the site of recurrence), are needed for symptom control.

In a series of 541 patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer and who were followed for at least 15 years, a gastric remnant carcinoma was diagnosed in 16 (2.9 percent), giving a 20-year cumulative risk of 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. The diagnosis of a metachronous gastric cancer versus recurrence may be difficult, but a different histologic type compared with the original tumor and location that is non-anastomotic favors a metachronous cancer in the gastric remnant. Results of surgical resection may be more favorable when a gastric remnant adenocarcinoma develops at a nonanastomotic site. In one series of 52 such patients who underwent a second operation with curative intent because of a remnant gastric cancer, the overall five-year survival rates were significantly higher for those with a non-anastomotic recurrence (96 versus 37 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PALLIATIVE GASTRECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, surgical intervention may provide effective palliation of symptoms such as pain, nausea, persistent bleeding, or obstruction. However, anemia in a stable patient should not be considered an indication for a palliative gastrectomy. Radical gastrectomy in this setting provides no survival benefit, but palliative gastrectomy can provide symptomatic relief and a possible improvement in survival, although this is controversial.

Complete surgical eradication of a gastric tumor with resection of adjacent lymph nodes represents the best chance for long-term survival. Unless there is unequivocal evidence of disseminated disease, major vascular invasion, or there are other contraindications to surgery, either abdominal exploration with curative intent resection should be undertaken or a neoadjuvant approach should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of operation for gastric cancer depends upon the location of the tumor within the stomach, the clinical stage, and the histologic type. The major surgical considerations include the extent of stomach resection (total versus partial gastrectomy) and the extent of lymph node dissection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Total gastrectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61753\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61753 \">figure 2</a>) is usually performed for lesions in the proximal (upper third) of the stomach, while distal gastrectomy (with resection of adjacent lymph nodes) appears to be sufficient for lesions in the distal (lower two-thirds) of the stomach. Patients with large midgastric lesions or infiltrative disease (eg, linitis plastica) may require total gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Total versus partial gastrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumors of the proximal stomach that do not invade the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) can be approached by either a total gastrectomy or a proximal subtotal gastrectomy. Total gastrectomy is preferred by most surgeons. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Proximal and esophagogastric junction tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical management of tumors involving the EGJ is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers#H7377444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers&quot;, section on 'Esophagogastric junction cancer resection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The optimal extent of lymphadenectomy is debated. While several randomized trials have failed to show an overall survival benefit from a D2 compared with a D1 resection, excess morbidity and mortality were clearly associated with the use of splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy to achieve complete node dissection. The most recent report of the Dutch trial and a 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis suggest that cancer-specific mortality rates are significantly lower in patients who undergo a D2 rather than a D1 lymphadenectomy. (See <a href=\"#H19671355\" class=\"local\">'D1 versus D2 dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">As a result, we suggest a D2 rather than a D1 resection for patients who are undergoing potentially curative resection of a gastric cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, aggressive nodal dissection should only be performed in selected centers where surgeons have demonstrated acceptably low operative morbidity and mortality rates. Perioperative mortality rates under 2 percent should be expected at centers with higher patient volume. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In contrast, there is no evidence that a D3 (paraaortic lymphadenectomy) confers a survival benefit over D2 dissection, and it is associated with greater perioperative mortality. We recommend that a D3 dissection <strong>not</strong> be considered for surgical treatment of gastric cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19671433\" class=\"local\">'D2 versus D3 dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While open gastrectomy remains the standard surgical treatment for gastric cancer worldwide, laparoscopic gastrectomy is performed with increasing frequency in high-volume centers with the requisite expertise (ie, primarily Asian countries). Laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery is most commonly performed for early gastric cancers that are not amenable to endoscopic resection. Laparoscopic gastrectomy for more advanced gastric cancers has been shown to be feasible in Asia, but further validation as to its long-term outcomes compared with open surgery is needed in Western populations before it can be considered a standard approach. (See <a href=\"#H555366964\" class=\"local\">'Open versus laparoscopic resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from several uncontrolled series suggest that some patients with initially locally advanced <strong>unresectable</strong> disease may respond to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy sufficiently that they are able to undergo potentially curative surgery. However, this approach should ideally be considered in the context of a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, surgical intervention may provide effective palliation of symptoms such as pain, nausea, bleeding, or obstruction. The criteria for selection of patients who may benefit from palliative gastrectomy as compared with other palliative procedures (including radiation therapy, endoscopic intervention, surgical bypass) are not firmly established. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Palliative gastrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic metastasectomy for isolated lesions is not associated with long-term survival. Pulmonary metastasectomy for isolated lesions can potentially result in long-term survival in rare, highly selected patients.
