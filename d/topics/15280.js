The goal of cardiac stress testing after revascularization is not only to evaluate for restenosis but also to determine the functional status and symptoms of the patient. There are few data (particularly randomized controlled trials) regarding the routine evaluation of asymptomatic patients post-revascularization, and cardiac stress testing for this reason is generally not recommended or necessary, with few exceptions such as patients who had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) for silent ischemia (ie, asymptomatic before the procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Stress testing following PCI can identify myocardial ischemia resulting from in-stent restenosis, the progression of coronary lesions in arteries that were not revascularized, or the development of de novo lesions. Stress testing after CABG can identify ischemia due to graft disease, downstream lesions, anastomotic lesions, progression of atherosclerosis in native non-grafted vessels, and incomplete revascularization. Ischemia after PCI or CABG can occur with patent stents and patent grafts because of jailed branches after PCI (eg, septal perforators or diagonal branches after stenting the left anterior descending artery [LAD]) or jeopardized branches after CABG (eg, septal perforators or diagonal branches arising from non-revascularized proximal LAD between sequential LAD stenoses even though the graft to distal LAD is patent). This is a big difference between post <span class=\"nowrap\">PCI/CABG</span> patients and those with native disease alone.</p><p>With radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) and echocardiography, a septal wall motion abnormality is common after CABG and not suggestive of myocardial necrosis, although myocardial scarring may be detected after seemingly uncomplicated procedures.</p><p>This section will review the role of stress testing in the detection of ischemia related to new or recurrent obstructive coronary heart disease (CHD) following revascularization with either PCI or CABG. A second issue, the use of stress rMPI or stress echocardiography prior to revascularization to detect hibernating myocardium (ie, dysfunctional but viable myocardium), is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging in coronary heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dobutamine stress echocardiography in the evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378223854\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of stress test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress rMPI and stress echocardiography are both useful imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The choice of test will vary depending upon local expertise and local availability as well as the clinical scenario. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When symptoms suggestive of obstructive CHD indicate the need for stress testing in patients with a history of revascularization, exercise electrocardiography (ECG) alone is rarely the preferred test, as the site and extent of any ischemia cannot be assessed. The need to identify the ischemia location with stress imaging in patients who have undergone prior revascularization is generally far more valuable than in a general population undergoing stress testing as an initial diagnostic tool, for whom ECG alone is often satisfactory. Therefore, when stress testing is performed for diagnosis of ischemia among patients who have undergone either PCI or CABG, we agree with recommendations from published society guidelines regarding the choice of stress test and imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Exercise/physiologic</span> stress with imaging using rMPI or echocardiography should be performed in patients who are able to exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasodilator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=regadenoson-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regadenoson</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>) rMPI or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography should be performed in patients who are not able to exercise.</p><p/><p>There are two main reasons for recommending cardiac stress testing with imaging rather than exercise ECG testing alone after coronary revascularization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity for detecting ischemia is significantly lower with exercise ECG testing alone compared with stress imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, the sensitivity of exercise ECG stress testing for the identification of ischemia related to graft stenosis or progression of underlying CHD was only 45 percent (compared with a sensitivity in the 80 to 85 percent range for both stress rMPI and stress echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The documentation of both the site (vascular territory) and extent of ischemia is possible when stress testing is performed with imaging.</p><p/><p>Both rMPI and echocardiography are adequate as the source of imaging when performing a stress test in patients who have undergone revascularization. A 2003 meta-analysis of nine studies evaluating stress rMPI and stress echocardiography for the detection of restenosis following PCI reported similar sensitivity and specificity for the two techniques (sensitivity and specificity 82 and 86 percent for stress echocardiography, 83 and 79 percent for stress rMPI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is important to note that the reference gold standard for CHD diagnosis in these studies was coronary angiography based on percent diameter stenosis, which is flawed, and these studies did not address the myriad causes of ischemia unrelated to stent or graft patency. The published society guidelines express no preference between the two imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793760265\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of exercise ECG testing without imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While exercise ECG testing without imaging is rarely indicated for the evaluation of symptomatic patients with prior revascularization, this test is sometimes performed as a means to guide the prescription of exercise for cardiac rehabilitation programs following either PCI or CABG or for assessing the hemodynamic response to exercise. The use of exercise ECG testing in this setting is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;, section on 'Intensity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic value of post revascularization stress testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both radionuclide rMPI and stress echocardiography have robust data supporting their role as a prognostic test following revascularization.

In a cohort of 266 patients with known CHD (93 percent with prior revascularization, including 34 percent CABG and 59 percent PCI) who were following for a median of 12 years, annualized cardiac mortality rate was 0.9 percent, with an annualized rate for cardiac death and nonfatal infarction of 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Test performance among reported studies is variable, related in part to differences in populations evaluated as well as the criteria for restenosis. Some of the factors influencing the correlation between stress testing and angiography include incomplete revascularization and the failure of angiographically-moderate single-vessel stenosis to lead to significant ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793760126\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of symptomatic patients</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793760133\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with symptoms hours to days post-revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic chest pain within 48 hours after PCI (with or without stenting) usually results from procedural events such as abrupt vessel closure (largely eliminated by stenting), transient coronary spasm, non-occlusive or occlusive thrombus, side branch occlusion, or distal embolization. Stress testing is not warranted in such patients, as patients with chest pain and ECG changes with a suspicion for an acute or subacute complication post-PCI generally require aggressive medical management and often repeat coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Myocardial ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>Ischemic chest pain in the hours to days following CABG usually results from early thrombotic occlusion of a saphenous vein bypass graft, often from a technical problem at the site of anastomosis. If symptoms are atypical, stress testing with imaging may be helpful in such patients to assess for size and distribution of any myocardial ischemia. However, since therapy for early saphenous vein bypass graft occlusion most commonly involves PCI, coronary angiography is often the preferred initial diagnostic test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early cardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Early graft occlusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793760139\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with symptoms months to years post-revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent symptoms developing months to years following PCI or CABG generally represent development of new obstructive CHD or progression of previously non-critical CHD, although in-stent restenosis, stent thrombosis, bypass graft stenosis or occlusion, or other manifestations of CHD may also be late occurrences. In such patients, stress testing with imaging is very useful for the evaluation of symptoms and the determination of the distribution, extent, and severity of any myocardial ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Stress imaging after coronary revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378224019\"><span class=\"h4\">Symptomatic patients following complete revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with recurrent anginal symptoms following what was thought to be complete revascularization (ie, no residual stenosis &gt;50 percent), stress testing with imaging is helpful for determining the distribution and extent of ischemia (if any) restenosis following PCI, graft failure following CABG, or the de novo development of a new obstructive CHD lesion. Additionally, imaging allows the clinician to identify the most likely anatomically-associated coronary artery or bypass graft.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center study of 346 patients who underwent stress rMPI (70 percent exercise, 30 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>) between 12 and 18 months post-PCI (94 percent with one or more stents, 79 percent deemed completely revascularized) and were followed for an average of 31 months, only 2 percent of patients without ischemia on rMPI had a hard event (cardiac death or infarction), compared with 12 percent of patients with ischemia on rMPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress rMPI can accurately detect myocardial ischemia related to bypass graft stenosis, even in patients with atypical symptoms, and can aid in localizing the stenosis, particularly if gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is performed. In one study of 50 patients with chest pain (atypical in 40 percent) an average of 51 months following CABG who all underwent both stress testing with rMPI and coronary angiography, the sensitivity and specificity of rMPI for detecting ischemia related to a 50 percent or greater stenosis were 80 and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic accuracy of stress echocardiography has also been evaluated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of stress echocardiography for the detection of graft stenosis or progression of native CHD after CABG were 86 and 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There was a trend toward greater sensitivity with stress echocardiography compared with stress rMPI (86 versus 68 percent), while specificity was similar (84 versus 90 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378224025\"><span class=\"h4\">Symptomatic patients following incomplete revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with recurrent anginal symptoms following revascularization that was deemed incomplete (ie, following PCI of the most critical stenosis with residual stenoses in other territories), cardiac stress testing with imaging is helpful for determining the distribution and extent of ischemia (if any) related to residual stenoses and the most likely anatomically-associated coronary artery.</p><p>In a prospective single-center cohort of 322 consecutive patients who underwent exercise rMPI four to six months after incomplete revascularization and were followed for a median of 33 months, the yearly rate of cardiac events ranged from 1.5 to 5.1 to 8.5 percent in patients with normal, mildly abnormal, and severely abnormal findings on exercise rMPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this setting, rMPI added incremental prognostic value to the clinical and angiographic findings and to the Duke treadmill score (DTS), particularly in patients with an intermediate or high score.

Similarly, given the durability of bypass grafting in the majority of patients, routine testing of asymptomatic patients post-CABG is also not recommended. However, routine stress testing may be of value for risk stratification in asymptomatic patients when performed more than two years after PCI or more than five years after CABG. This approach is based upon the premise that a positive test identifies asymptomatic patients who have a worse prognosis and might benefit from intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Regardless of imaging strategy, all patients should be treated with aggressive risk factor reduction (eg, aggressive antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation), which should slow the rate of progression and may even promote regression of native vessel disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Evaluation of asymptomatic patients following PCI has evolved considerably from the era of balloon angioplasty alone, in which restenosis was common and occurred in patients with no symptoms. In the era of drug-eluting stents, the incidence of restenosis and thrombosis following PCI is very low, especially in asymptomatic patients. As such, routine stress testing of asymptomatic patients following revascularization for purposes of diagnosis is generally not necessary.</p><p>While not routinely performed for diagnostic purposes in asymptomatic patients, stress rMPI or stress echocardiography can be important prognostically in asymptomatic patients, particularly those who were not completely revascularized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

In another non-randomized study, approximately 20 percent of asymptomatic patients were found to have inducible ischemia during stress echocardiography less than one year following PCI; patients with ischemia were more likely to die in the following five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a cohort of 869 asymptomatic patients who underwent exercise stress echocardiography more than two years after PCI or more than five years after CABG (mean follow-up of an additional 5.7 years), those with inducible ischemia had significantly higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
