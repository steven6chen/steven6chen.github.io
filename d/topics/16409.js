Approximately six million Americans and 15 million Europeans are living with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In 2011, the HF hospitalization rate in the United States was 18 per 1000 for those over age 64 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], making HF among the leading causes of hospitalization in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, about a quarter of those who are hospitalized with HF are readmitted within 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and 30 percent within 60 to 90 days post-discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A marked decrease in admission rates between 1999 and 2011 (30.5 percent reduction, 95% CI, 29.3-31.6) has not been matched by a comparable reduction in readmission rates, which declined 9.7 percent (95% CI, 8.5-10.8) over the same period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Data for Medicare patients show that risk-standardized rehospitalization rates and mortality rates were correlated only weakly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A majority of readmissions after HF hospitalization are not for HF, as shown in a separate study of Medicare patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Strategies to reduce hospitalizations in patients with HF include optimization of evidence-based drug and device therapies, addressing causes of HF, treating comorbidities, and improved management of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It has been suggested that reducing disruption during the hospitalization might lower readmission risk as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Evidence from randomized controlled trials has established the efficacy of certain drug and device therapies in reducing hospitalizations as well as mortality in patients with systolic HF, but treatment in patients with diastolic HF remains empiric since trial data are limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H20200745\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'General management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with HF are typically older adults with complex drug regimens for HF, multiple concurrent diagnoses, and resulting polypharmacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. They are often cared for by many clinicians. Because of these complexities, the care of HF involves more than straightforward medical management of a solitary disease. Moreover, HF patients may have trouble with balance, eyesight, hearing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> executive function that makes self-management difficult. Decreased cognitive function has been associated with readmission risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The clinician, working with others in a care team, must provide appropriate coordination of care, manage the patient between office visits, ensure adequate patient education to support the acquisition of self-care skills, and create safe transitions of care between settings.</p><p>This topic will review outpatient- and inpatient-based management strategies aimed at reducing the risk of hospitalization and rehospitalization for patients with HF.

class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of disease management programs has been evaluated in a variety of trials. However, the generalizability and validity of this evidence are difficult to ascertain given the wide variety of interventions tried and personnel involved and the fact that the evaluators and developers are often the same and blinding is not possible. Furthermore, as with all complex interventions of practice improvements, local context is critical for disease management, and the quality of implementation may be as important to success as the strategy itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20636329\"><span class=\"h4\">Impact on hospitalization and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the publication of large trials, numerous meta-analyses reviewed the effect of smaller studies of disease management for patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/18-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-26</a>]. The validity of combining data from these widely diverse programs has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most of the included studies were small, underpowered, single-site interventions, and most meta-analyses were limited in number of participants (about 2000 patients) and trials (less than 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; an exception is the 2012 Cochrane review discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The meta-analyses included only one or two randomized trials with more than 1000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. There is a substantial risk of publication bias particularly for small studies such that negative results are often not published, and study quality is generally low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. In addition, the heterogeneity of the interventions used in the trials raises questions about the value of pooling outcomes across studies even for high-quality trials. </p><p>Meta-analyses have typically divided disease-management programs into three broad categories: those that included in-person multidisciplinary follow-up either in clinic or at home, those that primarily promoted self-care, and those restricted to telephone support from a clinician (typically a nurse). However, categorization of studies is difficult since most of the self-management studies included other disease management interventions, and all programs included patient education. Generally speaking, the analyses suggest that programs that promoted self-care and those that included multidisciplinary team follow-up were more effective than programs utilizing telephone contact alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61054 \">table 1</a>). The following conclusions are suggested by meta-analyses, which should be considered exploratory rather than definitive given the quality of the evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/15,18,20,21,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,20,21,23-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies that incorporated in-person specialized multidisciplinary follow-up either at home or in clinic reduced HF hospitalizations (RR 0.74), all-cause hospitalizations (RR 0.81), and mortality (RR 0.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Programs that emphasized long-term patient self-care activities with frequent reinforcement reduced HF hospitalizations (RR 0.44-0.66) and all-cause hospitalizations (RR 0.59-0.80) but had no significant effect on mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/18,21,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21,23,25</a>].

These were commercial disease management programs, not directly involved with the patient&rsquo;s clinical practice, and included nurse-led telephone-based chronic care services (symptom monitoring and management, medication counseling, health education, self-care coaching). Approximately 75 to 96 percent of patients in the intervention groups participated in the interventions. However, evaluators identified little improvement in self-care practices in the intervention group. After 18 months, evaluators found no difference between intervention and control groups in hospitalizations, readmissions, emergency department utilization or mortality. Possible reasons for lack of success included the lack of integration of the disease management program into the beneficiary&rsquo;s primary health care team, the infrequency of phone contact (on average less than one contact per month and 80 days between contact), contacts not coinciding with the time of disease flare or hospitalization, and the large number of comorbid illnesses in this patient population.

These data are remotely transmitted to care providers on a daily or intermittent basis, allowing close monitoring of the patient&rsquo;s clinical status without office or in-home visits by health personnel. Telemonitoring data may be received by a nurse or personnel in a monitoring agency who screen data and only alert physicians of abnormal results, or data may go directly to ordering physicians. Telemonitoring should be distinguished from direct telephone calls with clinicians. Telemonitoring may be a stand-alone intervention or may be combined with other disease-management strategies. </p><p>Challenges of telemonitoring include ensuring that the data are submitted (strategies include self-reporting versus automated data transmission) and that they are appropriately reviewed and addressed. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs including 2710 patients with HF found that telemonitoring reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.81) and HF-related hospitalizations (RR 0.79, CI 0.67-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The trials were generally small and of low to moderate quality. Only one study satisfied more than five of the nine specified quality criteria. Another systematic review, including 12 RCTs and nine observational studies (3082 patients) found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Since the publication of the meta-analyses, three large negative trials have been reported. The largest trial to date, Tele-HF, enrolled 1653 patients with HF from 33 sites in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Subjects were randomly assigned to telemonitoring using an automated telephone-based system that collected daily information about symptoms and weight, or to usual care. The primary endpoint was readmission for any reason or all-cause mortality at 180 days. Secondary endpoints included hospitalization for HF. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any of the endpoints. Similarly, another large RCT of telemonitoring, TIM-HF which included 710 patients at 165 sites in Germany, found no difference in mortality or in the composite secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The BEAT-HF trial enrolled 1437 patients with HF at six sites in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Participants were randomly assigned to health coaching telephone calls and telemonitoring or usual care. No differences in rates of readmission for any reason (50.8 versus 49.2) or mortality at 180 days were found. Although 180-day quality-of-life scores were slightly better in the intervention group compared with the usual care group, data were available for only 55 percent of participants.</p><p>These multicenter trials suggest that telemonitoring in isolation is not likely to be a successful strategy for reducing readmission. However, their findings may not apply to telemonitoring provided in the context of a broader disease management program and are not generalizable to other types of telephone-based support that involve direct communication between clinicians and patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15404312\"><span class=\"h3\">Recommendations for disease management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15404215\"><span class=\"h4\">Guidelines and recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and the 2013 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] HF guidelines recommend multidisciplinary HF disease-management programs in high-risk patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44415840\"><span class=\"h2\">Remote hemodynamic monitoring via device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Remote hemodynamic monitoring is of uncertain efficacy and is thus not recommended.

The intervention group had a lower readmission rate within the first six weeks than the control group (10 versus 23 percent).</p><p/><p>However, a program that reduces readmissions does not necessarily reduce direct costs as illustrated by a prospective study of a nurse-led transitional-care program for patients with HF being discharged from a hospital in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Thirty-day readmissions, lengths of stay, and 60-day direct costs were compared with those for HF patients concurrently discharged from other hospitals within the same healthcare system. The program was associated with a 48 percent decrease in 30-day readmissions but had little impact on direct costs to the healthcare system over 60 days, and under the existing Medicare reimbursement system had a negative impact on hospital revenue. </p><p>Larger trials of discharge support, not limited to HF, have been conducted in the general medical population. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Care Transitions Program&trade; utilizes a &ldquo;transition coach&rdquo; to visit the patient in the hospital prior to discharge and ensure appropriate medication reconciliation, follow-up plans, and education. The coach then visits the patient at home within the first week of discharge and makes at least two telephone calls within the first 30 days to provide post-discharge support. In an RCT of 750 older adults (&ge;65 years old) hospitalized with medical conditions, intervention patients had lower rehospitalization rates at 30 days (8.3 versus 11.9) and at 90 days (16.7 versus 22.5) than control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, fewer than 20 percent of the patients enrolled in this trial had a discharge diagnosis of HF. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Project RED was an RCT conducted at an inner-city hospital that developed low-literacy appropriate patient education materials and utilized a dedicated &ldquo;discharge advocate&rdquo; to coordinate discharge support for adult medical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The 370 patients randomly assigned to the intervention had lower combined hospital and ED utilization than the 368 patients assigned to usual care (incidence rate ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.94). This intervention was estimated to save $412 per patient. However, the percentage of patients with discharge diagnosis of HF was not indicated.</p><p/><p>On the other hand, large-scale observational studies of printed discharge instruction content for patients with HF have found no relationship to readmissions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of 16,791 patients hospitalized with HF at 150 hospitals found that meeting the discharge instruction requirement set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had no relationship to one-year cardiovascular readmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, an observational study of 2222 hospitals found no association between hospital-level performance on the CMS discharge instruction measure and 30-day readmission rates for patients admitted with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p/><p>These findings suggest that discharge support and education must go well beyond a simple discharge instruction sheet to be effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14824343\"><span class=\"h2\">Early follow-up appointment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although prospective data are lacking, observational data suggest that an early follow-up appointment may reduce the risk of HF readmission. </p><p>An observational study of 30,136 patients with HF found that hospitals in the lowest quartile of early post-discharge physician follow-up (that is, hospitals whose patients were least likely to have follow-up within seven days) had a 3 percent higher 30-day readmission rate than the other 75 percent of hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>The value of an early appointment may depend on the quality of care at the visit which may be affected by the information available to the provider. An appointment may be necessary but not sufficient to reduce risk. Ideally, assessment should take place within one to two weeks after discharge, to reassess fluid status, review and adjust medications, plan additional testing if needed, and provide further patient education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Since this strategy might not be feasible for all of the many patients hospitalized for HF, particular focus for early follow-up should be targeted to patients who are at increased risk for early decompensation (eg, low systolic blood pressure, prolonged QRS duration, renal dysfunction, elevated natriuretic peptide level, elevated troponin levels, hyponatremia, or other comorbidities).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122754340\"><span class=\"h2\">Home visit programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of nine trials (1563 patients) found reduced risk of three- to six-month readmission (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.86) with intensive home visiting programs, though programs including only a single home visit appeared to be less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14824351\"><span class=\"h2\">Prompt communication with outpatient clinicians</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the effect of discharge summary transmission have reported mixed results. One observational study of 1246 discharge summaries from 45 hospitals found an association between discharge summary transmission to outpatient clinicians and lower readmission risk (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32-0.90); in addition, summaries including more content recommended by the Transitions of Care Consensus Conference were associated with lower readmission risk (OR 0.67, 95% CI, 046-0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Other studies, however, have not found benefit from discharge summary transmission. A multisite observational study of 1078 general medicine patients found no relationship between receipt of a discharge summary within two weeks of discharge and a composite outcome of ED visit, readmission and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Also, there was no apparent benefit to direct communication with physicians. Similarly, an observational study comparing 1039 patients rehospitalized within 30 days of discharge with 981 non-rehospitalized patients found no association between transmission of a discharge summary to an outpatient physician and readmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-hospitalizations-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p>Since these are observational and not randomized controlled studies, however, the question is raised whether timely discharge summaries and physician communication may be more likely for patients with the most complex clinical issues and highest risk of readmission. Additionally, the timeliness of discharge summaries may only be one component of their effectiveness, which might also be affected by the completeness and quality of the content, and the availability of support systems to facilitate appropriate response to issues raised by discharge summaries. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15404655\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations for inpatient and transitional care strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For inpatients with HF, we suggest comprehensive discharge support that should include close follow-up in the immediate postdischarge period. Programs limited to support in the inpatient setting (education, medication reconciliation, and care coordination) are less likely to be successful. Similarly, programs focused on only one aspect of discharge support (eg, only medication reconciliation or only sending discharge summaries to outpatient clinicians) are less likely to be successful. We suggest an inpatient and transitional care strategy for patients hospitalized with HF that incorporates adherence to guideline-based care, discharge support including individualized instruction, and early postdischarge follow-up, whether by phone, at home, or in clinic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2042174144\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

However less intensive outpatient and inpatient strategies have been found to be ineffective in improving patient outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H18202439\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of effectiveness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14824299\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient and transitional care strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although evidence on the efficacy of these strategies is not definitive, we suggest the following approaches:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Very large randomized controlled trials of varying protocols have reached disparate conclusions regarding the efficacy of disease management. If a decision is made to use disease management for outpatients at high risk of hospitalization, it would make sense to use a protocol similar to one of those that demonstrated a benefit in a large randomized trial. Some features of effective programs include a comprehensive approach that includes at a minimum frequent in-person contact with clinicians, and formal self-care education and support. Programs limited to telephone contact or remote data gathering (telemonitoring) are less likely to be successful. (See <a href=\"#H15404312\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for disease management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with HF who are already hospitalized, we suggest comprehensive discharge support that should include close follow-up in the immediate post-discharge period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Programs limited to support in the inpatient setting (education, medication reconciliation and care coordination) are less likely to be successful. Similarly, programs focused on only one aspect of discharge support (ie, only medication reconciliation, only sending discharge summaries to outpatient clinicians) are less likely to be successful. (See <a href=\"#H15404655\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for inpatient and transitional care strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At present there is insufficient evidence to recommend &ldquo;hospital at home&rdquo; programs.

However differences in patient risk factors and care that may explain these differences in outcomes are not well understood.
