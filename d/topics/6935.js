As an example, some patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage have warning symptoms of severe headache from a small bleed (also called a warning leak or sentinel bleed), usually occurring within the previous 30 days. However, most first hemorrhages appear to be serious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In this report, 20 ADPKD patients, 11 and 9 of whom had ruptured and intact intracranial aneurysms, respectively, were followed for a mean of approximately 15 years from the time of initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. All of the patients with ruptured aneurysms and one with an intact aneurysm had undergone surgery at diagnosis.</p><p>One patient had recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage, and no patient died during the study. On follow-up imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or conventional angiography at a mean period of 11.4 years, five patients (25 percent) had a new aneurysm in a different location, and two of the same five also had an increase in size of the previously known aneurysm. Ten patients underwent neurosurgery; the discrepancy between the number requiring surgery and the number with intracerebral aneurysm changes was due to the re-evaluation and different interpretation of the initial radiographic studies, resulting in surgery in patients initially not thought to be at risk for rupture.</p><p>When the groups with and without aneurysm changes were compared, no clinical factors were significantly associated with the development of a new aneurysm or an increase in size of an existing aneurysm. Factors that were studied included age at diagnosis, time to restudy, proportion of patients with initially ruptured aneurysm, time of follow-up, time to surgery, and proportion of patients requiring surgery.</p><p>The best available data from the general population suggest that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage from rupture of small aneurysms (&le;7 mm) is low in patients without a prior subarachnoid hemorrhage.

This was illustrated in a study of 18 patients with ADPKD who had small (&lt;7 mm), asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms on initial screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At a mean follow-up of eight to nine years, there were no aneurysm ruptures. A larger study from the same institution included 45 saccular aneurysms detected in 38 patients from 36 families. Most were small (median diameter 3.5 mm) and in the anterior circulation (84 percent). Median age at diagnosis was 49 years. During cumulative clinical follow-up of 316 years, no aneurysm ruptured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595851772\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally offer, although do not necessarily recommend, screening to adult ADPKD patients and discuss with them potential risks of screening versus the risks of rupture of an undetected aneurysm.</p><p>We recommend routine screening for high-risk patients, such as those with a previous rupture, a positive family history of an intracerebral bleed or intracranial aneurysm, warning symptoms, a high-risk occupation in which loss of consciousness would place the patient or others at extreme risk, and prior to surgery that is likely to be associated with hemodynamic instability with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,18</a>].</p><p>Some, but not all, centers screen all ADPKD patients who are undergoing renal transplantation.

Although data are limited, studies in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (most often not related to ADPKD) have concluded that, although it is not known whether anticoagulation increases the risk of intracranial bleeding, if rupture occurs, anticoagulation increases the severity of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,18</a>].

Among patients who have initially negative studies and no family history of CVA or hemorrhage, the role of additional screening is unclear, with some clinicians continuing to screen every five years. There are only limited published data upon which to base recommendations for rescreening such patients. In a prospective report, among 76 ADPKD patients who had an initially negative radiographic imaging procedure, at follow-up imaging at a mean period of 9.8 years, two patients (2.6 percent) were found to have a new intracranial aneurysm, but only one occurrence was clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Monitoring of patients who have aneurysms that do not require immediate surgical intervention is discussed below.

We generally prefer to use MRA for screening and use CTA only if there are contraindications to MRA (such as prior surgical clipping of aneurysm with a magnetic resonance noncompatible clip).</p><p>Both imaging modalities have been shown to have a high sensitivity for detection of aneurysms 3 to 5 mm or larger (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for intracranial aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Choice of screening test'</a>). Cerebral angiography is invasive and may be associated with an increased risk of cerebral bleeding or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Time-of-flight MRA does not require gadolinium contrast and can be performed safely at any level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

However, it is not unreasonable to reimage newly detected, small aneurysms at six months, since there is evidence that newly formed, small aneurysms may be at higher risk of rupture than older, more stable aneurysms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;</a>). Longer reimaging intervals are certainly appropriate if the six-month study shows no significant change.</p><p>There are limited data concerning the role of follow-up radiographic monitoring in patients found to have small aneurysms at screening.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 30 MRAs were performed in 10 patients who had asymptomatic aneurysms measuring 1.5 to 6.5 mm over a mean interval of 30 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Over a cumulative follow-up of 243 years, one de novo aneurysm was detected and increased in size from 2 to 4.4 mm over 144 months, and two previously detected aneurysms grew from 4.5 to 5.9 mm and 4.7 to 6.2 mm after 69 and 184 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety of anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ADPKD may require chronic anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for disorders such as deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation. As noted above, such patients should be screened for the presence of an aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with an aneurysm should be told about the relative risks and benefits of anticoagulation and be evaluated for possible nonpharmacologic therapies (eg, inferior vena cava filter for deep vein thrombosis and radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation).

Earlier studies that utilized ultrasound for screening reported a prevalence of approximately 10 to 20 percent below the age of 30 years and 50 to 70 percent over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. However, in a study of 230 patients with ADPKD between the ages of 15 and 46 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is much more sensitive than ultrasound for the detection of small cysts, identified hepatic cysts in 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The extent of the cystic disease in the kidney and the liver is only weakly correlated, suggesting that, in addition to the PKD mutations, other factors distinct for each organ are important for the development and progression of PKD and polycystic liver disease (PLD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In contrast to the renal phenotype, the ADPKD genotype was not associated with the severity or growth rate of PLD in ADPKD patients. This finding indicates that modifiers beyond the disease gene significantly influence the liver phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Hepatic cysts occurring in ADPKD are different from autosomal dominant PLD (ADPLD). Patients with ADPLD may have no or only few renal cysts, but mice with knockout of either of the two ADPLD genes first identified have polycystic kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of cystic lesions of the liver&quot;, section on 'Polycystic liver disease'</a>). Several additional genes associated with PLD with or without kidney cysts have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Although the overall prevalence of a polycystic liver in patients with ADPKD is similar in men and women, women may develop cysts at an earlier age, and massive cysts occur almost exclusively in women, particularly those who have had several pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/31,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,34</a>]. Such acceleration of hepatic cyst growth may be due to an underlying sensitivity of the cysts to female steroid hormones. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that postmenopausal estrogen may be associated with selective enlargement of hepatic cysts, as well as the hepatic parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Further supporting the role of female hormones in the progression of PLD is that 58 percent of females &gt;48 years of age with severe PLD (height-adjusted liver volume &gt;1800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m)</span> had a significant regression in liver volume on follow-up imaging, whereas the liver continued to enlarge in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Most patients remain asymptomatic with preserved hepatic function.

Aneurysms occur in approximately 5 to 20 percent of patients with ADPKD. Patients with a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage appear to be at greatest risk. Aneurysm rupture in ADPKD most often occurs with larger aneurysms, usually before the age of 50 years <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in patients with poorly controlled hypertension.

We screen all ADPKD patients who are undergoing renal transplantation. We also screen patients who require chronic anticoagulation for disorders such as deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation. We recommend not screening children (ie, &lt;18 years) with ADPKD, because aneurysmal rupture in childhood is extremely rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among patients with initially negative radiographic studies, we rescreen every five years those who have a family history of intracerebral bleeding or cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who have aneurysms that do not require surgical intervention, we suggest follow-up monitoring with CTA or MRA annually for two to three years and every two to three years thereafter if the aneurysm is clinically and radiographically stable. However, it is not unreasonable to reimage newly detected, small aneurysms at six months, since there is evidence that newly formed, small aneurysms may be at higher risk of rupture than older, more stable aneurysms.
