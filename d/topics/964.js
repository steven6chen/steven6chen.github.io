They also account for up to 40 percent of all fractures in the skeletally immature athlete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ankle fractures occur more often in boys than girls. Many fractures arise from activities such as basketball, soccer, inline skating, and riding motorized scooters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Distal fibular physeal fractures are the most common types of pediatric ankle fracture and are associated with a relatively low risk for long-term complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By contrast, distal tibial physeal fractures are associated with a higher risk for long-term complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomically, the ankle joint is best thought of as a hinge, with the talus held in place by the distal tibia (medial malleolus) and distal fibula (lateral malleolus). Immediately above the joint, but below the tibial physis, these bones are held together by strong syndesmotic ligaments. Additional stability is achieved through the medial and lateral ligamentous complexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medially, the superficial and deep fibers of the deltoid ligament extend from the malleolus to the talus, navicular, and calcaneus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952 \">figure 1</a>). This thick triangular ligament resists eversion of the ankle joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lateral ligamentous complex consists of three distinct bands that resist excessive inversion of the ankle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173 \">figure 3</a>). These include the anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>The majority of the ankle's stability comes from these ligaments, which are stronger than the adjacent physes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 4</a>). It should be noted that the medial and lateral ligaments arise directly from the tibial and fibular epiphyses. This anatomy accounts for the high percentage of physeal injuries about the ankle, which are caused by inversion and eversion stress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal tibial physis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distal tibial physis accounts for approximately 3 to 4 mm of limb growth per year and 15 to 20 percent of final leg length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The physis develops between 6 and 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A separation of the physis, beginning at approximately two years of age, divides it into medial and lateral portions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The medial malleolus begins to form as an extension of the tibial physis at approximately seven to eight years of age and is fully ossified by the age of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>The distal physis begins to close around 12 years in girls and 14 years in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Closure begins centrally, extends medially, and is completed laterally over the course of 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. This pattern of closure has important implications for the types of tibial fractures seen in late adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile Tillaux fracture'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Triplane fracture'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal fibular physis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distal fibular physis appears between 9 and 24 months of age at the level of the ankle joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Closure generally occurs approximately one to two years after distal tibial physis closure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankle fractures may occur with the ankle inverted or everted and with the foot neutral, plantar flexed, or dorsiflexed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>&quot;Rolling of the ankle,&quot; or an inversion injury, is the most common cause of ankle fracture in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Frequently, this mechanism occurs when the child trips on stairs, a street curb, uneven ground, or during sports play (eg, basketball, soccer, American football). Inversion injury typically causes a fracture of the fibula. If the force is extreme (eg, foot and ankle entrapment during a motor vehicle collision) or the foot is maximally plantar- or dorsiflexed at the time of impact, then the tibia may also be involved. In these instances, the ankle joint is often unstable.</p><p>Eversion injuries are less common but are associated with fractures of the tibia and fibula with accompanying instability of the ankle joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of ankle fractures is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108267\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108267 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Emergent conditions, such as an open fracture, neurovascular compromise, or fracture with dislocation, must be treated immediately.

Patients who have sustained major trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) are at risk for multiple traumatic injuries and warrant a complete physical examination and appropriate ancillary studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury&quot;, section on 'Blunt trauma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p>Once other injuries are excluded, the examination can focus on the ankle. Analgesia prior to examination (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum dose 800 mg for mild pain or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> 0.1 to 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum single dose: 10 mg for moderate or severe pain) will often facilitate the child's cooperation. We suggest that the clinician avoid the oral route for patients likely to require sedation or general anesthesia for fracture reduction or repair.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inspection</strong> &ndash; Clinicians should inspect the injured ankle for swelling, deformity, or skin abnormalities (eg, lacerations with possible open fracture, tenting, or blistering caused by rapid stretching of the skin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The amount of swelling is <strong>not</strong> a reliable guide to the presence of a fracture, especially a nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fracture or an avulsion fracture associated with an ankle sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with obvious deformity or malalignment of the foot relative to the lower leg are at greater risk for neurovascular compromise due to the presence of a fracture or fractures that have caused an unstable ankle joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82323 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpation</strong> &ndash; Palpation should include all of the bones of the lower leg, ankle, and foot. Clinicians should palpate the ankle looking for the point of maximal tenderness and other tender areas. The distal tibial and fibular physes deserve particular attention because the distal fibular physis, in particular, is the most common area of ankle injury in children. Testing for ligamentous laxity can be deferred until after radiographs are obtained; it is often not tolerated in the setting of an acute fracture. Evaluation of the ligaments of the ankle is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Significant tenderness, both medially and laterally, implies that the ankle is potentially unstable due to bimalleolar fracture with injury to the deltoid ligament and lateral complex, even in patients without obvious deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462 \">figure 2</a>). These patients should not ambulate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The examination of the distal tibia and fibula should include a careful examination in the area of the anterior joint line in addition to the medial and lateral malleoli, especially in older school-age children and young teenagers. Subtle juvenile Tillaux fractures may present with isolated tenderness in the anterior joint line and swelling extending over the distal fibula, while evaluation of the medial malleolus is normal. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile Tillaux fracture'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinician should also palpate the base of the proximal fifth metatarsal in patients with inversion injuries in order to assess for avulsion fractures and Jones fractures in this area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metatarsal-and-toe-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metatarsal and toe fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurovascular assessment</strong> &ndash; Neurovascular examination requires comparison of findings in both feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinician should palpate the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulse and determine capillary refill. Although pain may interfere with interpretation, the ability to extend and flex the toes tests the deep peroneal (fibular) and tibial nerves, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sensory evaluation involves testing of the following nerves in the indicated sites:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deep peroneal (fibular) nerve (between the first and second toes on the dorsum)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Superficial peroneal (fibular) nerve (remainder of the dorsal foot)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tibial nerve (sole of foot) which branches beneath the ankle to form the following nerves:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Medial planter nerve (medial plantar surface from great toe to middle of the fourth toe)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Lateral plantar nerve (lateral plantar surface from middle fourth toe to fifth toe)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Sural nerve (lateral foot)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Saphenous nerve (medial foot)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of ankle stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once emergent conditions have been excluded, the first priority in the evaluation of ankle injuries is to determine whether the joint is stable and can be managed nonoperatively, or whether the joint is unstable and must be referred.</p><p>Typically, an ankle injury is stable if it meets the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is isolated to the lateral or medial malleolus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no marked swelling, deformity, or malalignment of the lower leg and foot.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no associated ligamentous injury.</p><p/><p>An ankle injury is unstable if two or more sites of fracture or ligamentous disruption are suspected, such as a medial malleolar fracture with deltoid ligament disruption or a bimalleolar fracture. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with gross deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82323 \">picture 1</a>), severe pain, or concern for an unstable joint, should not be asked to perform active range of motion of the ankle joint or to walk.</p><p>If the ankle injury appears stable, the range of motion of the knee, hip, ankle, and subtalar joints (midfoot and toes) should be determined and the ability to ambulate should be assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical decision rules for ankle radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating acute (&le;72 hours) ankle injuries without major deformity, neurovascular compromise, or other serious or distracting injury in otherwise healthy children 3 to 16 years of age, we recommend that clinicians use a clinical decision rule to determine the need for ankle radiography. We recommend that the Low Risk Ankle Rule (LRAR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90427 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108267\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108267 \">algorithm 1</a>) be used rather than other clinical decision rules (eg, Ottawa Ankle Rules [OARs]). During implementation at multiple centers, the LRAR has been shown to reduce ankle radiography by 22 percent when compared to prior routine practice and is associated with high physician and parent satisfaction. Correct use of the LRAR requires appropriate application of the exclusion criteria and adequate clinician knowledge regarding examination of the ankle. (See <a href=\"#H4281506093\" class=\"local\">'Low Risk Ankle Rule'</a> below.) </p><p>The ability of the LRAR to significantly reduce the ordering of plain radiographs for ankle injuries in children largely lies with the willingness of the clinician and family to accept the possibility of not identifying nondisplaced fractures, including avulsion fractures or nondisplaced Salter-Harris I or 2 fractures that might have been visible on plain radiographs. Of note, these fractures occur in the minority of patients not requiring radiography according to the LRAR and, even if present, recover well without radiography when managed empirically with recommended treatment consisting of a removable ankle brace or similar device and return to activities as determined by symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H900718031\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Distal fibula fractures'</a> below.) </p><p>For any ankle injury, whether or not clinical decision rules are applied <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plain radiographs are obtained, the following anticipatory guidance is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small number of non-significant fractures may not be identified either by the application of a clinical decision rule or radiography at the time of injury. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course is also of significant importance in determining whether a fracture is present and that diagnosis may ultimately require repeat evaluation and a radiograph at 7 to 10 days after injury when bone healing is apparent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although ankle injuries are common in children, a systematic review of 12 studies found that, at most, 17 percent of these injuries will result in a visible bony fracture on radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite the low positive yield of imaging, most children with ankle injuries undergo plain radiography. For example, two reports from Canada indicate that radiographs are ordered on 80 to 95 percent of pediatric patients with acute ankle injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>], while rates of radiography may approach 100 percent in other settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>In an attempt to minimize the number of potentially unnecessary studies, clinical decision rules, including the LRAR and the OARs, have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>] to aid in decision making about the need for radiographs in children who present with acute ankle injuries. Of these rules the LRAR has been associated with the greatest reduction in radiography during prospective validation studies in children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4281506093\"><span class=\"h3\">Low Risk Ankle Rule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that clinicians use the Low Risk Ankle Rule (LRAR) when making decisions about ankle radiography.

(See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Distal fibula fractures'</a> below.)</p><p>The LRAR has a reported sensitivity for the detection of clinically important ankle fractures in children of 98 to 100 percent and a negative predictive value for high risk injury of 99.7 percent when the prevalence of clinically important fractures is about 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. </p><p>In a multicenter implementation study of the LRAR in six Canadian emergency departments, including community, general, and pediatric facilities evaluating 2151 children with ankle injuries, use of the LRAR reduced ankle radiography by 22 percent when compared to routine clinical practice with no significant difference in missed high risk fractures and physician or patient satisfaction and with sustained reduction in ankle imaging up to 72 weeks after implementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Furthermore, 94 percent of the participating physicians were willing to apply a symptomatic care strategy to this group of low risk ankle injuries indicating a high physician acceptance of the rule and the related management strategy for those cases where radiography is not indicated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> considered low risk for long-term complications. Subsequent cost analysis showed significant overall cost reductions when the LRAR was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The greatest savings were due to lower radiography costs, and fewer orthopedic or emergency department follow-up visits. In an additional retrospective European study that included 121 children with ankle injuries, use of the LRAR was estimated to safely reduce unnecessary radiographs by 64 percent, resulting in an annual savings of about USD $34,500 at this site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Ottawa Ankle Rule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the experience in adults, the use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) in children is less likely to reduce radiographic testing beyond those seen when no clinical rules are used. Thus, the clinical utility of the OAR for pediatric injuries is uncertain, and we suggest use of the LRAR. (See <a href=\"#H4281506093\" class=\"local\">'Low Risk Ankle Rule'</a> above.)</p><p>The OAR was initially derived, validated, and implemented in adults and has a reported sensitivity approaching 100 percent in this population. The rule is described in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69818 \">figure 6</a>). Utilization of the OAR in adults may reduce ankle radiography by as much as 30 percent without missing significant fractures. A significant fracture as defined by the OAR is considered any fracture &gt;3 mm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;, section on 'Ottawa ankle rules'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review of 12 pediatric studies (3130 children over two years of age) found a pooled sensitivity of 98.5 percent for the OAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Specificity had a range of 8 to 47 percent among the studies and a pooled estimate was not performed because of significant heterogeneity among the studies. The missed fracture rate given a negative OAR assessment was 1.2 percent (95% CI 0.6-2.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Based upon these findings, application of the OAR in children had an estimated reduction in radiography of 25 percent. Another methodologically robust meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of the OAR included 34 studies, 8 of which were pediatric. This reported a pooled OAR sensitivity of 97.9 percent (95% CI 94.9, 99.1) and specificity of 21.0 percent (95% CI 13.1 to 31.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In prospective validation studies of the OAR in children younger than 16 years of age with acute ankle injuries, the relative reduction in ankle radiography has only been approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17</a>]. </p><p>Two studies have compared the diagnostic characteristics of the OAR to the LRAR in pediatric patients: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective observational study of 272 children, the sensitivity of the OAR and LRAR for any visible fracture on radiograph was 100 percent and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the LRAR is not designed to identify all such fractures, but rather only high-risk fractures (see <a href=\"#H4281506093\" class=\"local\">'Low Risk Ankle Rule'</a> above). When examining the sensitivity of the LRAR using the original criteria of the LRAR and data from this study, the sensitivity of the LRAR increased to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this analysis, the respective specificities of these ankle rules were 27 percent for the OAR and 54 percent for the LRAR. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study that included 980 children, aged 12 months to 18 years, and conducted in a tertiary care ED in the United States reported the sensitivity of the OAR and LRAR as 100 percent and 86 percent, respectively. The respective specificity of these rules was 33 percent (potential radiograph reduction of 32 percent) and 65 percent (potential radiograph reduction of 63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While this reported sensitivity of the LRAR is lower than previously published in prospective studies, validating clinical decision rules with retrospectively collected chart-level data is highly prone to bias caused by lack of prospective application of inclusion and exclusion criteria for a specific rule and incomplete capture of pertinent positive and negative findings on physical examination. &#160;</p><p/><p>In summary, both the OAR and LRAR have value. The strength of the OAR is its consistently high sensitivity across numerous studies in adults and children. However, its limitation is its low specificity, whereby application of the rule results in obtaining radiographs in most children, resulting in limited clinical impact for the goal of reducing unnecessary radiographs. Also, implementation studies of the OAR in children are lacking. The LRAR also has reportedly high sensitivity for high risk fractures in prospective multicenter studies, alongside a high specificity, with significant potential to safely reduce unnecessary imaging. There is also a rigorously done implementation study that reinforces the safe use of this rule. However, there are few external prospective validation or implementation studies, limiting knowledge on the generalizability of the LRAR. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a clinician is concerned about fracture based on physical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the application of a clinical decision rule, the child should receive plain radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical decision rules for ankle radiography'</a> above.)</p><p>Standard ankle radiographs consist of the following views:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior-posterior (AP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortise</p><p/><p>The mortise view is taken from anterior to posterior with the leg internally rotated 20 degrees.

This approach directs the clinician to the appropriate area of injury and facilitates radiographic interpretation. For example, in patients with nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fractures of the tibia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibula, there is no visible fracture on initial radiographs. Diagnosis of this injury requires correlation of the clinical finding of growth plate tenderness with other radiographic evidence such as adjacent soft tissue swelling or widening of the growth plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Similarly, subtle juvenile Tillaux fractures may present with tenderness isolated to the anterior joint line and swelling extending over the distal fibula, while palpation of the medial malleolus is free of any tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling. The physical examination aids the clinician in recognizing this fracture on plain radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile Tillaux fracture'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1542942006\"><span class=\"h3\">Salter-Harris classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Salter-Harris classification system provides the easiest and most commonly used method of describing ankle fractures in skeletally immature children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This system grades physeal fractures as types I through V. Complications of physeal injury include growth arrest, permanent decreased range of motion, and angular deformity. Salter-Harris I and II ankle fractures are at lower risk for these complications than those that are Salter-Harris III or higher. Higher grades of Salter-Harris fracture often require operative repair.

The typical mechanism of injury is inversion of the ankle with the foot pointed away from the midline (supination with external rotation). This mechanism leads to avulsion of the lateral tibial epiphysis that is attached to the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76624 \">figure 8</a>).

Although MRI can better discern between a sprain and a growth plate or ossified bone injury when compared with a plain radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], the information typically does not change initial management. MRI may be useful in children whose radiographic imaging remains normal but whose recovery from injury is prolonged. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Distal fibula fractures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H900718031\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with ankle fractures typically present with ankle pain, swelling, bony tenderness, and inability to ambulate. Plain radiographs confirm the diagnosis for many of these children. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical decision rules for ankle radiography'</a> above.)</p><p>The most common pediatric ankle injury presents after ankle inversion with tenderness over the distal fibula and plain radiographs that do <strong>not</strong> show a bony abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/7,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,18</a>]. In the past, these ankle injuries, when occurring in skeletally immature children, were presumed to be a Salter-Harris I fracture through the distal fibular physis (growth plate) rather than an ankle sprain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. However, prospective, observational studies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the gold standard, have demonstrated that the vast majority of these children actually have sprain injuries, rather than physeal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 135 children (5 to 12 years of age) with a clinical diagnosis of a distal fibular Salter-Harris I fracture and normal plain radiographs, MRI demonstrated a nondisplaced Salter-Harris I distal fibular fracture in four (3 percent) cases, two patients had partial injuries to the growth plate, and all four had associated ligamentous injuries. Among the 131 children without physeal injuries, 104 (79 percent) had ligamentous injuries, 38 of which were associated with radiographically occult distal fibular avulsion fractures, indicating a high-grade sprain. The remaining 27 (21 percent) had isolated bone contusions, a very mild injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Thus, evidence suggests that the majority of children with inversion ankle injuries and no bony abnormality on plain radiographs have sprains and that nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fractures of the distal fibula are uncommon. These findings have important implications for management of pediatric patients with inversion injuries. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Distal fibula fractures'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis and management of ankle sprains are discussed separately.

These injuries are still fractures, and pain is expected to persist for two to four weeks, limiting activities to some degree. However, pain does gradually abate in this time frame in the vast majority of children. Return to full activities, including competitive sports, typically occurs by 6 to 12 weeks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These fractures typically result from inversion ankle stress in the skeletally immature child. These injuries are stable and are at very low risk for any long-term complications such as refracture, growth arrest, malunion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With Salter-Harris I fractures, there is a fracture through the distal fibular physis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 7</a>).

Avulsion fractures occur when a small piece of bone is pulled off of the distal fibula by the lateral ligamentous complex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite the benign nature of this group of fractures, these fractures have traditionally been managed using a below-knee cast for three to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Disadvantages to this approach include delay in returning to normal activities, patient discomfort, development of a tight cast, skin ulceration, and, rarely, compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,31</a>]. Theoretically, a cast offers greater protection than alternative means of immobilization such as a removable ankle brace or tubular bandage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the fibula is not prone to refracture and, based upon several small trials, return to activity is achieved sooner when immobilization other than casting is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25,28,29</a>]. For example, in a randomized trial of 104 children with non-displaced distal fibular Salter-Harris I, II, or avulsion fractures, a greater proportion of the 54 children who received a removable ankle brace had returned to normal baseline activity at four weeks when compared with the 50 children who received a fiberglass below-knee walking cast (81 versus 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, the removable brace was superior with respect to patient preferences and was also cost-effective.

Finally, in a trial of 135 children with inversion ankle injuries and no fracture seen on plain radiograph who received a removable ankle brace and self-regulated return to activities, the 42 children with fractures detectable only by MRI (primarily distal fibular avulsion fractures) had a comparable recovery to those with isolated ligamentous injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Displaced Salter-Harris I or II</strong> &ndash; Displaced Salter-Harris I or II fractures require prompt orthopedic consultation for reduction and casting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Salter-Harris III through V</strong> &ndash; These fractures of the fibula are very rare and have not been reported to occur as isolated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Rarely, a Salter-Harris III fracture occurs in the medial malleolus before physeal closure; this most often follows an injury with eversion stress and is typically accompanied by a fracture of the distal fibula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to plain radiographs, computed tomography of these fractures is often indicated to evaluate the extent of displacement. Juvenile Tillaux fractures with &gt;2 mm of displacement warrant urgent orthopedic consultation for closed or open reduction. Some of these fractures may require percutaneous pinning to maintain reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].After discussion with an orthopedist, children with non-displaced Salter-Harris III fractures, as determined by computed tomography, may be given crutches and placed in a posterior below-knee splint or cast pending evaluation and continued care by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise within one week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with nondisplaced Salter-Harris III fractures typically undergo long leg casting for four to six weeks with conversion to a short leg cast or boot for an additional two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Weightbearing is initiated based on radiographic healing and clinical examination. Patients should anticipate eight weeks of nonweightbearing. Return to full activities frequently occurs by 10 to 12 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with displaced fractures requiring reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> instrumentation warrant close ongoing orthopedic care to ensure adequate reduction and to determine the optimal timing for hardware removal and return to normal activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Salter-Harris type IV</strong> &ndash; Type IV fractures involve the ankle joint and urgent orthopedic consultation is indicated. If located medially, these fractures are caused by inversion stress and are shearing type injuries that need fixation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Triplane fracture describes a Salter-Harris IV fracture of the tibia that occurs in the sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes and creates between two and four fracture fragments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67327\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67327 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The mechanism of injury is debated but many orthopedists feel it involves inversion of the ankle with extreme turning out of the foot (supination with external rotation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Computed tomography is required to discern the degree of displacement in patients with Salter-Harris IV fractures. Open reduction with internal fixation of these injuries is usually necessary to obtain adequate reduction. Failure to reestablish articular continuity may result in premature arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, risk of growth arrest is significant. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These injuries warrant close ongoing orthopedic care to ensure adequate reduction and to determine the optimal timing for hardware removal and ultimately, return to normal activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Salter-Harris V</strong> &mdash; These rare fractures result from axial loading of the extremity (eg, a fall on the heel from a height leading to physeal compression) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 7</a>). Patients with multisystem trauma may be at particular risk for unrecognized Salter-Harris V injuries. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial plain films may show narrowing of the physis but are frequently unremarkable. Any suspected Salter-Harris V fracture warrants urgent orthopedic assessment. These patients need ongoing orthopedic care for several years because of the high risk of growth arrest and need for corrective surgery. Unfortunately, many of these injuries are difficult to detect and may not come to attention until growth arrest has already occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have received operative care should be admitted for 24 to 48 hour observation of neurovascular status and soft tissue compartments.

Growth arrest is most commonly seen in children with Salter-Harris III or IV fractures of the tibia, especially when initial reduction is incomplete. Thus, all tibial growth plate fractures should be monitored closely by an orthopedist for up to two years to observe for proper healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteochondral defect </strong>&ndash; Defects in the talar dome may occur after ankle fractures in children and should be suspected in patients with persistent pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankle-fractures-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

This type of compartment syndrome is characterized by severe ankle pain and swelling, weakness on toe extension, increased pain with passive toe flexion, and decreased sensation in the first web space (between the great and second toe).
