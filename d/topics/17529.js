During the teenage years participation in many sports put the young athlete at risk for acute (eg, football, hockey) and repetitive overuse injuries (eg, swimming, baseball, tennis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Understanding the anatomy and applicable biomechanics of the shoulder is essential to identifying these injuries.</p><p>The causes of acute shoulder injury in the children and skeletally immature adolescents will be reviewed here. The evaluation of acute traumatic shoulder injury in children and the physical examination of the shoulder is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute traumatic shoulder injury in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15374514\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complex network of anatomic structures endows the human shoulder with tremendous mobility, greater than any other joint in the body. The shoulder girdle is composed of three bones (the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus) and four articular surfaces (sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). The glenohumeral joint, commonly referred to as the shoulder joint, is the principal articulation. The shoulder is an inherently unstable joint that relies on several delicate interactions to minimize the risk for injury. The shape and interaction of the bones and soft tissues of the shoulder girdle are essential to understanding the factors leading to shoulder stability. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glenohumeral structures &ndash;</strong> The glenohumeral joint is loosely constrained within a thin capsule bounded by surrounding muscles and ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70854 \">table 1</a>). The shoulder's great mobility is due in large part to the shallow depth of the glenoid and the limited contact between the glenoid and the humeral head. Only 25 percent of the humeral head surface makes contact with the glenoid. The labrum, a fibrocartilaginous ring attached to the outer rim of the glenoid, provides some additional depth and stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. It also serves as a bumper to decrease the potential for humeral head subluxation. The shallowness and small surface area of the glenohumeral joint make it susceptible to instability and injury and require that stability be provided primarily by extrinsic supports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surrounding muscles and ligaments provide these supports:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The glenohumeral ligaments are collagenous reinforcement of the capsule and quite variable in their thickness, anatomic position, and their contribution to shoulder stability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54102 \">figure 1B</a>). The glenohumeral ligaments serve as the primary static stabilizer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The inferior glenohumeral ligament complex (IGHL) is made up of the anterior and posterior bands and the posterior axillary pouch that form a hammock like structure. In abduction and external rotation, the anterior band is the primary restraint to anterior translation of the humeral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the absence of the anterior IGHL, the middle glenohumeral ligament may provide some restraint to anterior humeral translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the flexion and internal rotation, the posterior band of the IGHL and the posterior capsule are the primary restraints for posterior movement (translation) of the humeral head relative to the glenoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rotator cuff serves as the primary dynamic stabilizer. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor) that form a cuff around the head of the humerus, to which these muscles attach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027 \">figure 2</a>). The rotator cuff compresses the humoral head in the glenoid fossa, thereby stabilizing the glenohumeral joint, and serves to counterbalance the elevating forces of the deltoid, as well as the forces of other muscles acting on the humerus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Glenohumeral structures'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other structures</strong> &ndash; The clavicle serves as a strut attaching the upper extremity to the axial skeleton through the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints and the scapulothoracic articulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). The function of the clavicle includes supporting the weight of the arm, providing additional dynamic mobility to the arm, and transferring force from the arm to the rest of the skeleton. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sternoclavicular joint has the least amount of bony stability of the major joints of the body, but paradoxically bears the responsibility of being the only true articulation between the upper extremity and the axial skeleton. The convex articular surface of the clavicle is much larger than the curved notch of the sternum resulting in an incongruous mismatch. Despite this instability, dislocation at this joint is rare. Both bones are covered with thick fibrocartilage (not the usual hyaline cartilage) and are separated by an intervening fibrocartilage disk which provide added cushion to the joint. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The muscles primarily responsible for scapular stability and motion are the trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboids, and levator scapulae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50894\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50894 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is supported by ligaments that span its anterior, superior, posterior, and inferior aspects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016 \">picture 1</a>). These ligaments also envelop the distal 1 to 2 cm of the clavicle. In addition to the AC ligaments, the distal clavicle is held in alignment with the acromion by the strong coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments. These ligaments consist of the conoid ligament medially and the trapezoid ligament laterally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bony development</strong> &ndash; As a general rule, the bones that form the shoulder girdle (ie, scapula, humerus, and clavicle) are not fully ossified in the young athlete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83709 \">table 2</a>). Thus, the skeletally immature athlete has open epiphyses that are two to five times weaker than the surrounding soft tissues and are prone to fracture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some patients, skeletal immaturity or variation in ossification can lead to misdiagnosis as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A lateral epiphysis fracture of the clavicle can be confused with an acromioclavicular joint injury (eg, acromioclavicular sprain or separation) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bipartite coracoid may be mistaken as a coracoid fracture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salter I fracture of the proximal humerus may be misdiagnosed as a soft tissue injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medial clavicular epiphysis fracture can be confused with a sternoclavicular dislocation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Os acromiale can be mistaken for an acromion fracture</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335158\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE-THREATENING AND SERIOUS CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening causes of shoulder pain after an injury include posterior sternoclavicular dislocation and referred pain from a serious underlying injury to the neck, abdomen, or myocardium.</p><p>Pathologic fractures and thoracic outlet syndrome represent conditions that are more serious than isolated injuries to a previously normal shoulder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335289\"><span class=\"h2\">Sternoclavicular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sternoclavicular (SC) injuries are rare in the young athlete. Because the physis (growth plate) of the medial clavicle does not close until 22 to 25 years of age, Salter-Harris I or II physeal fractures with displacement of the medial clavicular fragment are more common than true SC dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. These injuries are typically a result of tremendous force applied to the shoulder or medial clavicle. However, patients with hypermobility syndromes, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, or other generalized ligament laxity syndrome, can have this injury following significantly less trauma.</p><p>Medial clavicular fracture with anterior displacement or anterior SC dislocation is the most common type of SC injury accounting for up to 90 percent of SC dislocations in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and the majority of injuries reported in a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Medial clavicular fractures with posterior displacement or posterior SC dislocation can cause significant life-threatening internal injury including tracheal compression, laceration of the subclavian or brachiocephalic vessels, pneumothorax, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. </p><p>The mechanism of injury may involve direct trauma to the medial clavicle and sternum (eg, misplaced kick during soccer or during mixed martial arts contest or a helmet blow during American football) or, more commonly, indirect trauma to the SC joint by anterolateral or posterolateral forces applied to the shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. When a blow is applied directly to the anteromedial aspect of the clavicle, the clavicle is pushed posteriorly behind the sternum into the mediastinum. With indirect forces, if the shoulder is forced forward and medially, an ipsilateral posterior fracture with dislocation results; if the shoulder is forced backward and medially, an ipsilateral anterior fracture with dislocation occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335813\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with sternoclavicular (SC) injury typically have anterior chest and shoulder pain that is worsened by arm movement. Patients with medial clavicular fracture with posterior displacement or posterior SC dislocation may also complain of difficulty breathing, dysphagia, or upper extremity paresthesias. If posterior displacement of the medial clavicle or clavicular fracture injures the recurrent laryngeal nerve, hoarseness may also be present. On physical examination, the medial end of the clavicle is displaced posterior, posteroinferior, or posterosuperior with respect to the sternum. However, this displacement may be difficult to appreciate. Patients with medial clavicular fracture and anterior displacement or anterior SC dislocation have a prominence at the SC joint that is displaced anteriorly or anterosuperiorly to the sternum. </p><p>Plain radiographs are typically sufficient to identify medial clavicular fractures with anterior displacement or anterior SC dislocations. In addition to routine clavicle series, a modified AP view with a 40 degree cephalic tilt or the &ldquo;serendipitous view&rdquo; will best visualize the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Plain radiographs alone are insufficient to characterize medial clavicular fractures with posterior displacement or posterior SC dislocations. When these injuries are suspected, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest is indicated to assess the full extent of bony abnormality and to identify potential vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Injuries are classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; Mild to moderate displacement without dislocation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; Acute, traumatic, anterior dislocation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; Chronic, traumatic, anterior dislocation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV &ndash; Chronic, nontraumatic, anterior dislocation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade V &ndash; Posterior dislocation </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335820\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of SC fracture and displacement or dislocation is determined by the direction of displacement and the degree of deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior SC dislocation or medial clavicular fractures with posterior displacement (Grade V) warrant prompt delineation with contrast-enhanced chest CT. Patients with airway compromise should undergo immediate reduction. In patients without airway compromise, reduction should occur within 24 hours, preferably by an orthopedic surgeon. Consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon should be performed prior to reduction in these patients, especially when an underlying hematoma is present on CT. Otherwise, bleeding may occur post-reduction from an untreated vascular injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Closed reduction will usually result in a stable reduction of a posterior SC dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Open reduction is reserved for irreducible posterior displacement with symptoms of compression with these injuries. However, displaced fractures of the medial clavicle frequently do not maintain reduction and open reduction with suture stabilization is the first-line treatment in many facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Post-reduction treatment consists of a figure of eight brace for four to six weeks, resumption of overhead activities at six weeks, and restriction of contact sports or activities for six to eight weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior SC fractures with dislocation (Grade III) should undergo reduction by a skilled practitioner but displacement usually recurs. Because of the potential for bone remodeling in the young athlete, proper healing is typically achieved without surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Post-reduction treatment is the same as for posterior SC fractures with dislocation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior or posterior SC injuries with pain and deformity but no dislocation (Grade I) should immobilized with the application of a figure-of-eight strap or sling and swathe for four to six weeks. Follow up with an orthopedic surgeon is necessary because patients with continued pain and mechanical sensation after six weeks of conservative management may warrant surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is managed with local ice application and oral analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5006658\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduction of posterior sternoclavicular dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Displaced medial clavicle fractures require reduction by an orthopedic surgeon. Closed reduction of SC dislocations is also best performed by an orthopedic surgeon. However, airway compromise in a patient with a posterior SC dislocation may mandate reduction by an emergency physician. The technique for closed reduction of a posterior SC dislocation is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85909\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85909 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide local anesthesia or procedural sedation for pain control.

Thus, the young athlete with shoulder pain warrants a careful assessment for these potential injuries and cervical spine immobilization should be maintained or applied to patients whose injury or clinical findings suggest cervical spine trauma.

Patients with significant trauma and altered mental status or distracting injury (eg, long bone fracture causing significant pain) should be assumed to have a neck injury.

Posterior shoulder dislocation typically arises from a blow to the anterior portion of the shoulder, axial loading of an adducted and internally rotated arm or violent muscle contractions following a seizure or electrocution. Examination reveals prominence of the posterior shoulder with flattening anteriorly. The coracoid process appears prominent.

The forearm is pronated and in most cases rests on the top of the head. Approximately 60 percent of patients will have some degree of neurologic dysfunction, with the axillary nerve most commonly involved.

The diagnosis of burners can usually be made by the history and physical examination. In most cases, it is a brachial plexopathy involving the upper trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 9</a>). It is characterized by pain radiating down one upper extremity. Immediately after contact, the player classically feels burning pain in the supraclavicular area. It radiates down the arm, generally in a circumferential, nondermatomal pattern. The player might also note numbness, paresthesias, or weakness in the extremity. Frequently the discomfort resolves spontaneously in one to two minutes.

Each of these areas should be tested manually. Although weakness can resolve within a few minutes of the acute injury, it can also develop hours or days later. Reexamination of patients with burners until normalization is imperative. The baseline strength of some athletes is so high that manual muscle testing might not detect subtle deficits; comparing one side to the other can be helpful.

Specific patterns are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scapula body and spine fractures</strong> &ndash; The most common sports mechanism is direct blows in American football [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Associated injuries include rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, brachial plexus disruption, and axillary artery laceration. Most fractures heal with supportive measures but fractures with &gt;10 mm of displacement are associated with malunion and worse long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glenoid fractures </strong>&ndash; Glenoid neck fractures are relatively rare in the pediatric age group, but have been reported as a skiing injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. On plain radiographs, these fractures will extend from the suprascapular notch to the lateral scapular border inferior of the glenoid rim. When this fracture is associated with a midclavicular fracture, it is considered a &ldquo;floating shoulder&rdquo; injury because these structures are essential to providing a foundation to suspend the arm to the axial skeleton. Indications for surgical and nonsurgical management are debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Displaced fractures may be treated with open or closed reduction, but regardless of treatment, usually have good functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glenoid fossa fractures (excluding bony Bankart lesions associated with shoulder instability injuries) result from a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the shoulder, driving the humeral head into the glenoid fossa. The fracture can extend inferiorly through the lateral scapular border, medially through the body of the scapula, or produce comminution of the glenoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In the pediatric population, a fall on the tip of the shoulder will drive the scapula inferiorly while the fracture fragment is held in place by the stronger coracoclavicular ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The fracture will track along the epiphysis of glenoid fossa, located at the upper one-third of the glenoid and inferior to the coracoid process. It is rarely complicated by a suprascapular nerve injury. This injury can mimic an acromioclavicular separation and the Stryker Notch view may help to demonstrate the fracture on radiography. Most of these injuries are treated nonoperatively with immobilization for four to six weeks, but displacement of more than 10 mm or more than 40 degrees of angulation requires surgical management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acromion fractures </strong>&ndash; Fractures of the acromion are rare and often misdiagnosed in the presence of an os acromiale because they both are most commonly located at the junction between the meso and meta-acromion. Fractures can occur with an inferiorly directed blow to the superior aspect of the acromion or a fall with a superiorly directed axial load that translates the humeral head superiorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The first mechanism will usually result in an acromioclavicular separation, but if fractured, it may be complicated by a brachial plexus root avulsion. The latter, when associated with significant superior displacement, may be complicated by injury to the rotator cuff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Thus, contralateral radiographs may be helpful in distinguishing between a nondisplaced fracture and an os acromiale.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coracoid fractures </strong>&ndash; Coracoid fractures have been caused by both direct and indirect trauma. Direct trauma to the tip of the coracoid is associated with the rare subcoracoid glenohumeral dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Indirect trauma can occur from avulsion injury during strong muscular contraction of the pectoralis minor muscle and short head of the biceps when the arm is in the abducted and extended position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. An avulsion injury can result from a fall on the acromion that usually results in an acromioclavicular separation, but in this case, results in tearing the coracoid attachment of the coracoclavicular ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Most fractures without displacement and intact coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular ligaments will heal with immobilization in a sling in internal rotation. Those with more displacement (&gt;5 mm) and disrupted ligamentous structures may benefit from surgical management. The more distal on the coracoid process the fracture is located, the more likely that healing will be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H684359\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of shoulder pain and injury is discussed in greater detail separately.
