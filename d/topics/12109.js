The defect occurs at the base of the umbilical cord, with the <span class=\"nowrap\">cord/umbilical</span> vessels inserting at the apex of the omphalocele sac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71646 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related omphalocele, primarily focusing upon prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy management. The other major fetal abdominal wall defect, gastroschisis, is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroschisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroschisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY/PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal abdominal wall defects result from disturbances in organogenesis during the embryonic period. During the fourth to fifth week of development, the flat embryonic disk folds in four directions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> planes: cephalic, caudal, and right and left lateral. Each fold converges at the site of the umbilicus, thus obliterating the extraembryonic coelom. The lateral folds form the lateral portions of the abdominal wall, and the cephalic and caudal folds make up the epigastrium and hypogastrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Rapid growth of the intestines and liver also occurs at this time. During the sixth week of development (or eight weeks from the last menstrual period), the abdominal cavity temporarily becomes too small to accommodate all of its contents, resulting in protrusion of the intestines into the residual extraembryonic coelom at the base of the umbilical cord. This temporary herniation is called physiologic midgut herniation and is sonographically evident the 9th to 11th postmenstrual weeks (up to crown rump length 45 mm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54907\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54907 \">image 1</a>). Reduction of the hernia occurs by the 12th postmenstrual week; thus beyond the 12<sup>th</sup> week a midgut herniation is no longer physiological [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A simple midline omphalocele develops if the extraembryonic gut fails to return to the abdominal cavity and undergo the obligatory 270 degree counterclockwise rotation back into the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. For this reason, omphalocele is considered a rotational anomaly, covered by the two-layer amnionic-peritoneal membrane, into which the umbilical cord inserts, and usually identified only after 10 postmenstrual weeks. Gastroschisis is truly an abdominal wall hernia defect and occurs much earlier in organogenesis (postmenstrual weeks six to eight). &#160;</p><p>In contrast to fetal bowel, the liver does not undergo physiologic migration outside of the abdominal cavity during development. Therefore, the liver is never present in physiologic midgut herniation. If the lateral folds fail to close, a large abdominal wall defect is created through which the abdominal cavity contents, including the liver, can herniate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The result is a liver-containing omphalocele.</p><p>Omphaloceles are associated with a high frequency of fetal aneuploidy when they contain only small bowel (ie, the liver is intracorporeal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. An extracorporeal liver often, but not invariably, is associated with a normal fetal karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Between 1999-2001 and 2005-2007, the prevalence of omphalocele increased by 11 percent, whereas the prevalence of gastroschisis increased by 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of omphalocele appears to be more common in women at the extremes of reproductive age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In women &lt;20 or &gt;40 years of age, the odds of developing omphalocele are more than doubled compared with the general obstetric population: OR 2.45 (95% CI 1.22-4.86) and OR 8.76 (95% CI 4.02-19.32), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence is slightly higher in blacks than whites (1.91 versus 1.47 per 10,000 live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Modest associations between omphalocele and maternal obesity and in utero selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure have also been reported in some studies, while others have found no association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Omphalocele has also been associated with male sex and multiple births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTNATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postnatal diagnosis of omphalocele is based on physical examination showing the characteristic clinical finding of an anterior midline abdominal mass with a covering membrane at the site of cord insertion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71646 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], although the covering membrane may be difficult to see or ruptured. Ascites may be present and associated anomalies are common. (See <a href=\"#H48272405\" class=\"local\">'Associated abnormalities and syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17814228\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the end of the first trimester (11 to 14 weeks), almost all omphaloceles can be detected by prenatal ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The omphalocele appears as an upper, middle, or lower midline abdominal wall defect of variable size, covered by an outer membrane of amnion and an inner membrane of peritoneum with Wharton's jelly between the two layers and containing abdominal contents. The defect is most commonly middle at the base of the umbilical cord, with the <span class=\"nowrap\">cord/umbilical</span> vessels inserting at the apex of the omphalocele sac. The sac typically contains bowel and may contain liver, stomach, or bladder. Ascites may be seen in the sac or the abdomen.</p><p>Omphaloceles are categorized as either non-liver-containing (containing bowel loops) or liver-containing. Eighty percent of omphaloceles contain part of the liver; the term giant omphalocele has been used to describe omphaloceles that contain most (&gt;75 percent) of the liver or have a very large size (absolute or with respect to the fetus), although &ldquo;large&rdquo; is variably defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The location of the liver is important, in part because non-liver-containing omphaloceles are commonly associated with a fetal aneuploidy, while liver-containing omphaloceles are usually associated with euploid fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/7,8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,19</a>].</p><p>Prenatal diagnosis of a non-liver-containing omphalocele can be made reliably after 12 postmenstrual weeks; prior to this time it can be difficult to differentiate from physiologic midgut herniation. Prenatal diagnosis of liver-containing omphalocele can be made by transvaginal sonography as early as 9 to 10 postmenstrual weeks if a homogenous mass measuring greater than 5 to 10 mm in diameter suggestive of liver is imaged within the area of physiologic midgut herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. The sonographic diagnosis of a liver-containing omphalocele can be made before the 12th postmenstrual week because herniated liver is never a normal developmental finding.</p><p>Increased nuchal translucency at first-trimester Down syndrome screening has been associated with an increased risk of fetal structural anomalies, including omphalocele. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration (MSAFP) is elevated in most pregnancies in which omphalocele is noted on second-trimester ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

As many as 60 percent of omphaloceles not containing liver are associated with fetal aneuploidy, particularly trisomy 18 or 13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one series of 250 fetuses with an omphalocele and an abnormal karyotype, the karyotypes included trisomy 18 (n = 158; 63 percent), trisomy 13 (n = 44; 17 percent), trisomy 21 (n = 9; 4 percent), Turner syndrome (n = 15; 6 percent), triploidy (n = 12; 5 percent), and rare chromosomal deletions (n = 12; 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risk of aneuploidy is higher when additional anatomic anomalies are present than in isolated omphalocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/17,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30,31</a>]. It should be noted that although omphalocele may appear to be an isolated anomaly prenatally, a substantial proportion of these fetuses will have associated abnormalities identified after delivery (12 of 31 cases [39 percent] in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and 5 of 19 cases [26 percent] in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]).</p><p>The incidence of associated structural anomalies generally ranges from 35 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], but has been reported to be over 80 percent in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/30,31,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,36,37</a>]. Associated abnormalities that occur with increased frequency in these fetuses include additional gastrointestinal abnormalities, cardiac defects (up to 50 percent of cases), genitourinary anomalies, orofacial clefts, neural tube defects, defects of the diaphragm, polyhydramnios, and growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/12,20,21,37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20,21,37-41</a>].</p><p>Associated syndromes are best categorized by upper, middle, and lower midline omphalocele defects. Omphalocele has been associated with several syndromes, including Pentalogy of Cantrell (upper midline defect), amniotic band sequence, schisis association (at least two of the following defects: neural tube defect, oral cleft, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia); lower midline associated defects are associated with OEIS syndrome (omphalocele, exstrophy of the bladder, imperforate anus, spinal defects), Shprintzen syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, Goltz syndrome, Marshall-Smith syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, otopalato-digital type II syndrome, CHARGE (coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital abnormality, and ear abnormality) syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (hallmark features: macroglossia, gigantism, omphalocele) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>]. In one large series of almost 1500 newborns with omphalocele, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was the most common genetic abnormality identified (incidence 6 percent versus 3 percent for trisomy 13, 2 percent for trisomy 18, and 1 percent for trisomy 21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The prevalence of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is particularly high (10 to 20 percent) in fetuses with isolated omphalocele.

The membranous sac helps to distinguish omphalocele from gastroschisis (which is characterized by free-floating loops of bowel); however, in cases of giant omphaloceles (&gt;4 to 5 cm defects) membranes occasionally rupture in-utero. If the membrane ruptures, the locations of the liver and cord insertion site can help to differentiate an omphalocele from gastroschisis. Omphalocele is often associated with an extracorporeal liver while the liver is intracorporeal in gastroschisis. The cord insertion site is umbilical in omphalocele and paraumbilical onto an otherwise intact abdominal wall in gastroschisis. </p><p>Covered abdominal wall defects less than 2 cm in diameter should be considered hernias of the umbilical cord. They have no associated anomalies or genetic syndromes.

Omphalocele and body-stalk defects are connected to the cord. Ectopia cordis (and the Pentalogy of Cantrell), which has at least a portion of the heart outside of the body cavity, is the classic upper midline omphalocele association. Bladder exstrophy develops below the cord insertion and represents the benchmark lower midline omphalocele defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96558 \">table 1</a>).

Microarray molecular testing has been recommended whenever fetal structural anomalies are detected on prenatal ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], but the additional value over a standard G-band karyotype in isolated omphalocele is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>It is reasonable to offer amniocentesis for genetic testing for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, but this testing is complicated and should be discussed with a geneticist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Cytogenetically detectable abnormalities involving 11p15 are found in &le;1 percent of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome cases. Additional molecular genetic testing can increase the detection rate (positive findings include loss of methylation of DMR2, gain of methylation of DMR1, presence of paternal uniparental disomy for 11p15, or mutations in sequencing of CDKN1C). For individuals with a family history of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, prenatal diagnosis can be performed when the genetic mechanism is known. There is a 10 to 20 percent risk of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in fetuses with apparently isolated omphalocele on ultrasound.

Visceral trauma has also been reported after cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE NEONATE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery room</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate care of the newborn with omphalocele involves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/34,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,67</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile wrapping of the bowel to preserve heat and minimize insensible fluid loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insertion of an orogastric tube to decompress the stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilizing the airway to ensure adequate ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing peripheral intravenous access</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning left-side down right-side up if low blood pressure, tachycardia, or dusky bowel appearance suggesting vascular compromise</p><p/><p>One approach is to place gauze dressings soaked in warm sterile saline and cover the dressing with clear plastic wrap; some use a plastic bag that encloses the infant up to the chest. Excessively wet and circumferential dressings should be avoided because they can macerate the omphalocele sac and cause the newborn's temperature to drop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Circumferential abdominal wall wraps also should be avoided as they have the potential to compromise blood flow. </p><p>Intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics are administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Cardiorespiratory and fluid status should be monitored closely and a thorough physical examination performed to identify additional malformations.

In all cases, the size of the abdominal wall defect must be balanced with right of domain (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">antero/posterior</span> depth of abdominal cavity). In general, small defects (2 to 3 cm) can be repaired in the first 24 to 72 hours of life by primary closure of both fascia and skin. The remaining spectrum of defects usually involve some type of silo in the first 24 hours of life and delayed closure. The silo can be reduced gradually over three to seven days in the intensive care unit, after which the infant is returned to the operating room for final closure of the abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Reducing a large defect or one that contains an anatomically kinked liver can be done with Doppler ultrasound guidance to ensure the vena cava and hepatic outflow are not compromised during the silo reduction. Giant omphaloceles (&gt;5 cm defects with &gt;75 percent liver out) may be managed by a combination of silo, acellular dermal patch, and skin graft or by promoting formation of an amniotic sac eschar by application of a sclerosing solution (topical povidone-iodine), with delayed hernia repair.</p><p>After omphalocele reduction, the neonate may require prolonged mechanical ventilation because of respiratory difficulties and caval compression. Postoperative increase in intra-abdominal pressure required to restore intestinal right of domain must be carefully monitored through urine output, pulse rate, and blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/34,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,66</a>]. Infants with very large omphaloceles containing most of the liver may require multiple reconstructive procedures and have the potential for long-term morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Nutritional status, associated anomalies, and pulmonary hypoplasia all play major roles in determining whether the child will have a good long-term outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported survival rates vary and reflect the ability to make the diagnosis of abdominal wall defects prenatally and the decision of many families to proceed with termination of pregnancy when severe or multiple anomalies are present. Neonatal morbidity and mortality rates are directly correlated with the presence or absence of associated anatomic and chromosomal anomalies; thus, the severity of the associated anomalies is closely linked to fetal and neonatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/30,69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,69-71</a>].</p><p>The size of the defect can impact prognosis. Although a study that compared long-term outcomes of survivors with minor versus giant defects reported no difference between the two groups in quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], repair can be a long and difficult process, involving multiple reconstructive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Neonates with an extracorporeal liver have a poorer prognosis than those with an intracorporeal liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/51,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,74</a>].</p><p>A study using a prospectively collected database including almost 1500 infants with omphalocele discharged from 348 neonatal intensive care units in North America from 1997 to 2012 reported the following outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>60 percent of births occurred at term and 28 percent occurred between 33 and 36 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>82 percent of live births survived to hospital discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9 percent had pulmonary hypertension and half of these newborn received pulmonary vasodilating drugs. The risk of infant death is as high as 45 percent in infants with pulmonary hypertension. The incidence of pulmonary hypertension appears to correlate with the size of the defect; it has been reported in 37 percent of infants with giant omphalocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among survivors, the median length of hospitalization after birth was 17 days.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF RECURRENCE IN FUTURE PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of omphalocele are sporadic. The recurrence risk is dependent on the underlying cause. If the fetus is trisomic, the recurrence risk is 1 percent. For isolated omphalocele with normal karyotype, the recurrence risk is less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, the risk of recurrence increases if a parental balanced translocation is detected.</p><p>Omphalocele associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (macroglossia, gigantism, omphalocele) should prompt chromosomal analysis to determine if there are duplications or abnormalities of chromosome 11p15, since familial cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can be autosomal dominant and have a 50 percent recurrence risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An omphalocele is a disorder of rotation and results in a midline abdominal wall defect, most commonly at the cord insertion site. It is covered by a membrane, and associated abnormalities are common. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetuses with an omphalocele containing liver typically, but not invariably, have a normal karyotype. If the liver is entirely intracorporeal, the risk of aneuploidy is high. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology/pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal ultrasound examination can detect virtually all cases of omphalocele and define associated anomalies, which can occur in any organ system. (See <a href=\"#H17814228\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroschisis is the major disorder to consider in differential diagnosis. It can be differentiated from omphalocele by its absence of a membranous sac and paraumbilical (rather than umbilical) cord insertion site. (See <a href=\"#H50470162\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of fetal karyotype should be offered because of the increased risk of aneuploidy in these fetuses. Genetic microarray molecular testing is reasonable in any fetus with structural anatomic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Obstetrical management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After diagnosis, we perform serial ultrasound examinations every three to four weeks to follow fetal growth and weekly nonstress tests with amniotic fluid index (modified biophysical) after 32 weeks to assess fetal well-being. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up obstetrical care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest avoiding routine cesarean delivery of fetuses with omphalocele (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Cesarean delivery is performed for usual obstetric indications, including risk of trauma in fetuses with liver herniation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Timing and route of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the delivery room, neonatal management involves covering the defect with gauze dressings soaked in thermally neutral sterile saline, covering the dressing with clear plastic wrap, inserting an orogastric tube to decompress the stomach, stabilizing the airway to ensure adequate ventilation, and establishing peripheral intravenous access. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the neonate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall survival is about 90 percent. This high survival rate reflects the ability to diagnosis abdominal wall defects prenatally and the decision of many families to proceed with termination of pregnancy when severe or multiple anomalies are present. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of omphalocele are sporadic. Recurrence risk depends on the cause. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrence in future pregnancy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/omphalocele/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Duhamel B.
