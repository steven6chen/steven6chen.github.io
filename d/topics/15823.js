It usually occurs during inspiration, but can also occur during expiration. Habitual snoring is common, occurring in 44 percent of males and 28 percent of females who are between 30 and 60 years of age in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Occasional snoring is almost universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Snoring is indicative of increased upper airway resistance and increased pharyngeal collapsibility. Snoring, particularly if loud and habitual, may indicate the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder characterized by obstructive apneas and hypopneas that occurs when upper airway resistance is sufficient to disrupt sleep. Snoring can also be associated with conditions that narrow the upper airway, including obesity, nasal congestion, craniofacial abnormalities, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. These conditions, in turn, may cause snoring without OSA, or snoring that occurs as a symptom of OSA. It is important to recognize the clinical features of conditions associated with snoring so that objective testing can be performed and treatment initiated, if indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3954725454\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the symptom of snoring is an acoustic phenomenon, the presence of snoring can indicate significant upper airway pathophysiology. Snoring is associated with upper airway narrowing, increased upper airway resistance, and pharyngeal collapsibility, which may range from mildly abnormal to severely elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At relatively low levels of upper airway resistance, there may be snoring without sleep disruption or symptoms of disturbed sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As upper airway resistance increases, there is a compensatory increase in respiratory effort in order to maintain ventilation. The increased effort may be associated with transient arousals from sleep related to respiratory effort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H3891958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Respiratory effort-related arousals'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As upper airway resistance becomes more severe, obstructive apnea and hypopnea may occur, leading to more fragmented sleep, increased symptoms and signs of disrupted sleep, and oxyhemoglobin desaturation.</p><p/><p>Although snoring is indicative of increased upper airway resistance, its absence does not exclude increased upper airway resistance or OSA. This is especially true among women and patients who have had a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4137432593\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As snoring can be a marker of pathologic upper airway narrowing, progression of snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is of clinical importance. While rates of progression have not been well studied prospectively, the available evidence suggests that progression is likely with weight gain. This was demonstrated by a retrospective cohort study of 160 middle-aged men with untreated snoring or OSA who were followed for a mean of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) increased with both weight gain and time in patients with untreated snoring, mild OSA, or moderate OSA. Weight gain had a seven-time larger effect on the AHI than time. A one-point gain in the body mass index over one year corresponded to an increase in the AHI of five events per hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1837184456\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early, large epidemiologic studies suggested that snoring may be related to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. However, these studies did not distinguish the effects of snoring from the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which often coexists and is known to have cardiovascular and cerebrovascular consequences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related breathing disorders and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This limitation was addressed in subsequent studies, which are described below. It now appears that snoring may be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, but there is little evidence to support an independent relationship between snoring and either hypertension or ischemic heart disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid atherosclerosis &ndash; An observational study categorized 110 patients with nonhypoxemic OSA into three groups according to the proportion of the total sleep time spent snoring: mild snoring (&le;25 percent), moderate snoring (26 to 50 percent), or heavy snoring (&gt;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Heavy snoring was associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, even after adjustment for known confounders (odds ratio 10.5, 95% CI 2.1-51.8). In addition, there was a dose-response gradient, with the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis being 20, 32, and 64 percent among those with mild, moderate, and heavy snoring, respectively. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) were unrelated to the prevalence of carotid artery atherosclerosis. This study suggests that snoring alone may be associated with carotid atherosclerosis. It is postulated that the endothelial cells in the carotid artery walls are subject to direct vibratory damage from heavy snoring, thereby contributing to plaque formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension &ndash; In an observational study, 1415 individuals who were referred to a sleep disorders center underwent polysomnography and blood pressure measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among individuals without OSA, hypertension was equally likely among heavy snorers and non-snorers (20 versus 18 percent for non-snorers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This study suggests that snoring alone is not associated with an increased risk of systemic arterial hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic heart disease &ndash; In an observational study of 5338 adults without known cardiovascular disease, self-reported habitual snoring, in the absence of a physician diagnosis of sleep apnea, was not associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular event and death rates compared with non-snoring over a median follow-up of 7.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This study, along with smaller observational studies, suggests that snoring alone is not independently associated with ischemic heart disease or all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation &ndash; Limited data suggest that snoring may be associated with systemic inflammation. In a cross-sectional study of 887 Korean adults who underwent polysomnography, those with primary snoring (AHI &lt;5) or mild OSA (AHI between 5 and 15) had shorter telomere length compared with non-snorers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Reduced telomere length is associated with cellular aging and is accelerated by oxidative and inflammatory stress. One postulated mechanism for the finding in individuals who snore is that repeated vibratory stimuli during snoring cause mechanical and inflammatory stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Disruption of the bed partner's sleep may also be a significant problem that can cause the bed partner to have daytime sleepiness and marital dissatisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1515032892\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary purpose of evaluating patients who snore is to identify potential causes of increased upper airway resistance, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort, 34 percent of men with habitual snoring and 19 percent of women with habitual snoring met the minimum diagnostic criteria for OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other potential etiologies that should be considered include nasal congestion, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, craniofacial abnormalities, and obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2575383567\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is useful to include the bed partner or a family member when evaluating a patient who snores because they may have greater insight into the problem than the patient. The patient, bed partner, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family member should be asked about symptoms or signs of OSA, including frequency and intensity of snoring, episodes of breathing cessation, periods of silence terminated by loud resuscitative snoring, restless sleep, and awakening with a sensation of choking, gasping, or smothering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 1</a>). Excessive daytime sleepiness may exist, but it is often unnoticed or underestimated because of its insidious onset and chronicity. Moodiness, poor concentration, and morning headaches may also be present. The clinical features of OSA are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms and signs of conditions associated with increased upper airway resistance other than OSA should also be sought. Nasal congestion or a history of allergies, sinusitis, or sinus surgery may warrant further investigation, since inadequately treated nasal or sinus disease is a potential cause of snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Frequent sore throats or mouth breathing may indicate adenotonsillar hypertrophy, especially among young patients. Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation may be due to hypothyroidism. Craniofacial abnormalities and acromegaly are generally suspected on the basis of physical examination findings, rather than symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The history should also cover sleep position, sleep deprivation, habits, and medication use that will have a bearing on snoring. Habits associated with snoring include smoking and alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>]. Benzodiazepine use has been demonstrated to cause snoring and increased upper airway resistance in healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2479794096\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be examined for physical signs associated with OSA, including truncal obesity, a large neck circumference, and a crowded oropharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55998%7EPULM%2F67818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55998 graphicRef67818 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Physical findings associated with OSA are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should also look for physical findings suggestive of other causes of snoring. Obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, nasoseptal deviation, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and nasal polyps may be obvious. Patients with nasal congestion may have nasal turbinates that appear boggy and edematous. The mucosal tissue is often erythematous, or may have a pale bluish hue or pallor. The mucosa can also appear relatively normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction#H16905688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of nasal obstruction&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with acromegaly may manifest acral, articular, and soft tissue overgrowth, while patients with hypothyroidism may have delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes, bradycardia, coarse hair and skin, puffy facies, enlargement of the tongue, and hoarseness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363328706\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary purpose of diagnostic testing in a patient who snores is to confirm or exclude the presence of OSA, since OSA is associated with significant clinical consequences and requires long-term therapy. Further testing for OSA should be considered in patients with loud habitual snoring and witnessed apneas in association with excessive daytime sleepiness, obesity, heart disease, and the presence of suggestive craniofacial features. Screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91571 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F96753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96753 \">table 3</a>) or STOP-Bang questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87572 \">table 4</a>) can indicate a higher likelihood of OSA and the need for either in-laboratory polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. An approach for determining which patients are sufficiently likely to have OSA to warrant such diagnostic testing is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications for diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnostic testing for suspected craniofacial abnormalities or adenotonsillar hypertrophy may include lateral cephalometric radiographs to provide information about the patency of the patient's upper airway. This is generally performed along with otolaryngology consultation. Factors that should prompt referral include a structural abnormality causing obstruction, cranial nerve dysfunction, severe epistaxis, or a mucosal abnormality that has been refractory to a trial of nasal inhaled glucocorticoid medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction#H809634165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of nasal obstruction&quot;, section on 'Referral'</a>.)</p><p>Metabolic testing is indicated for suspected acromegaly or hypothyroidism, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4105893260\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4005749360\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), treatment of snoring is indicated for patients who want to minimize disruption to their bed partner's sleep or to relieve themselves of any embarrassment caused by the snoring.</p><p>Routine treatment cannot be justified at this time to improve daytime symptoms, hypertension, or risk of ischemic heart disease because these findings do not appear to be more common among snorers than non-snorers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/17,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,33</a>]. There is evidence that snoring may contribute to carotid artery atherosclerosis; however, this needs to be confirmed before treatment is suggested for the purpose of preventing carotid disease. (See <a href=\"#H1837184456\" class=\"local\">'Potential consequences'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2401250001\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative approaches</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1771812772\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss is recommended for obese patients who snore since it may improve snoring and has additional health benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Importance of weight loss'</a>.)</p><p>While most patients who lose weight will have a reduction in snoring frequency, improvement is not universal and cannot be predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Additional support for the concept that weight loss reduces snoring comes from the observation that weight loss improves OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Since OSA and snoring are both due to increased upper airway resistance, any intervention that improves one can reasonably be expected to improve the other. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Weight loss and exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371252544\"><span class=\"h3\">Tobacco and alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking cessation is recommended for all patients. Elimination of alcohol consumption, especially during the several hours prior to bedtime, is recommended for patients who snore. Both interventions may reduce snoring and have numerous other potential health benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H2589684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Benefits of smoking cessation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effect of smoking cessation on snoring has not been tested in randomized trials or observational studies. There is observational evidence that current smoking, and possibly former smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], is associated with snoring. It is not known why smoking is associated with snoring, but nightly nicotine withdrawal and nasal congestion have been proposed as etiologies.</p><p>The impact of reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption on snoring has not been evaluated in randomized trials or observational studies. There is observational evidence that alcohol consumption is transiently associated with increased airway resistance and snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The likely cause of the increased airway resistance during sleep is decreased tone in the pharyngeal dilator muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2108151064\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleeping in the lateral position is a low-risk intervention that warrants a trial in most patients who snore, although the evidence that this approach durably improves snoring is limited and inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. </p><p>A number of devices have been developed to reduce the likelihood of sleeping in the supine position, including posture alarms, special pillows, and modified nightshirts. A simple device that can be made at home is a snug-fitting T-shirt with a pocket sewn over the spine and tennis balls placed in the pocket. Obese patients may benefit from a harder type of ball, such as a baseball. The discomfort associated with rolling into the supine position is generally enough to prompt the patient to roll back into the lateral position without awakening.</p><p>One trial compared a head positioning pillow with a normal pillow in patients with mild, supine-dependent OSA (supine apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] more than double the lateral position AHI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The head positioning pillow was designed to help maintain airway patency in both the supine and lateral positions. Compared with a normal pillow, the head positioning pillow was associated with significant reductions in subjective snoring intensity and frequency, but not with objective measures of snoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2528982547\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal patency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior nasal valve is one of the airway segments with the smallest cross-sectional area, and it offers the greatest resistance to airflow during sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F102226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102226 \">figure 1</a>). Conditions that partially obstruct the already narrow airway (eg, allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, anatomic factors) can further increase resistance and contribute to snoring. The negative pressure in the lower airways that is required to overcome high nasal resistance may promote partial or intermittent collapse of the pharynx, worsening snoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085323778\"><span class=\"h3\">Decongestants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal congestion can impair airflow through the nose. When snoring arises in association with acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis, symptomatic measures to reduce nasal congestion before bedtime, such as saline nasal irrigation or intranasal decongestants, may help alleviate snoring. Intranasal (topical) decongestants are less likely to cause systemic side effects than oral decongestants. However, topical decongestant use should be limited to two to three days because more prolonged use can induce rebound nasal congestion and rhinitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment#H17857688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Of note, one trial tested the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>, alone or in combination with the prokinetic agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a>, for severe snoring in patients not screened for sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Compared with placebo, pseudoephedrine resulted in more nights rated as having &quot;no&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; snoring. However, given the small size of the trial and the known side effects of regular use of pseudoephedrine, this medication cannot be recommended for regular use of snoring reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130689687\"><span class=\"h3\">Intranasal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A trial of intranasal (topical) glucocorticoid therapy is reasonable for snorers with chronic nasal congestion. Those patients whose snoring improves may benefit from chronic therapy. However, at least one study in which nasal steroids were tested on a group of snoring subjects (in which OSA was not objectively ruled out) did not show any improvement in snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Intranasal glucocorticoids'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis#H25107347\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid nasal sprays'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2045330979\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal dilators are devices that attempt to dilate the anterior nasal valve. External and internal dilators exist, and the impact of each on snoring has been evaluated. Given the low risk and burden of the intervention, a trial of using an external dilator is reasonable for most individuals who have snoring that is not associated with OSA and who continue to snore despite the conservative interventions described above.</p><p>An external nasal dilator is a stiffened adhesive strip that is applied externally across the nasal alae. It retracts and stabilizes the nasal alae, dilating the anterior nasal valves. External nasal dilators increase nasal cross-sectional area and decrease nasal airflow resistance, but these effects are highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>A systematic review on nasal dilators identified several small studies that measured snoring subjectively before and after use of a nasal dilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. All studies reported a decrease in either snoring frequency or intensity. However, the one study that included an objective measure of snoring obtained during polysomnography did not find a decrease in snoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545640687\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures to improve nasal patency have been tried in an effort to treat snoring, but supporting data are sparse and inconsistent. One study found a reduction in subjective snoring in 64 individuals undergoing septoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There was no relationship between the severity of septal deviation and improvement in snoring. Another study found no improvement in objective measures of snoring in 40 individuals who underwent septoplasty with or without partial resection of the inferior turbinates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Given the lack of evidence, nasal surgery to treat snoring cannot be recommended at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3339330173\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical approaches</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369016750\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral appliances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral appliances increase the size of the upper airway during sleep, which decreases snoring. They typically work by advancing the mandible, changing the position of the soft palate, retracting the tongue, or a combination of these mechanisms. Practice guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend oral appliances for patients who fail conservative measures and request treatment of their snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-appliances-in-the-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral appliances in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oral appliances may be highly effective for snoring when used properly. In one study of 23 patients with primary snoring (no evidence of OSA on polysomnography), a crossover design was used to study the effect of a mandibular advancement device in either the advanced or non-advanced position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In the advanced position, both snoring intensity (as rated by bed partners) and the number of snores per hour (during recorded home study) were reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Indirect evidence in patients with OSA also supports the hypothesis that oral appliances can reduce snoring. A systematic review of oral appliances for OSA identified eight studies that evaluated objective measures of snoring before and after treatment with an oral appliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Snoring frequency and snoring intensity were reduced in some, but not all, studies. Other studies published subsequent to this review confirm these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. A limitation of these studies is that the included subjects had a broad spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing, not just primary snoring.</p><p>During the period of initial use, side effects are common (up to 80 percent in some studies) and include excessive salivation, mouth dryness, difficulty chewing in the morning, tooth pain, gum irritation, headaches, and temporomandibular joint discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/47,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,52</a>]. These side effects are generally minor and self-limiting. Long-term side effects, seen in up to 15 percent of patients, include occlusal changes such as changes in the degree of overjet and overbite and changes in the dental arch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-appliances-in-the-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral appliances in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>Oral appliances should be fitted by dentists with expertise in sleep-related breathing disorders. Fitting includes fabrication in a dental laboratory from impressions of the patient's bite or custom molding from a prefabricated device. Follow-up polysomnography is not necessary when snoring alone is treated with an oral appliance. Regular long-term follow-up for side effects is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2205282779\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous positive airway pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective, safe, and reversible therapy for snoring, although the effects of snoring have been primarily studied in patients with some degree of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. However, many patients without daytime symptoms do not accept CPAP because of its inconvenience, and most insurance policies do not cover the cost of CPAP for patients if snoring is the only indication.

Both therapies were associated with significant improvement in patient and partner assessments of snoring. The oral appliance was chosen more frequently for long-term use (eight patients chose an oral appliance, five chose CPAP, and seven decided against further therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3071684849\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery for snoring has been widely studied. However, the quality of the evidence is limited due to multiple factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most studies are case series or case control studies with a small number of patients, including some with mild OSA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most studies use subjective outcomes to measure snoring pre- and post-surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many studies combine nasal and upper airway techniques</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most studies have short follow-up times</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies that have measured long-term outcomes consistently find that the initial effect on snoring is not sustained over time</p><p/><p>Because of these limitations, surgical treatment of snoring should only be considered in patients who have tried and failed the conservative approaches discussed above. One guideline further recommends that only minimally invasive techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation or palatal implants, be considered for snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281386644\"><span class=\"h3\">Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) involves surgically removing tissue from the soft palate and tonsillar pillars. It can be done through traditional surgical techniques or laser-assisted, which allows for outpatient therapy.</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that UPPP or laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) can be used to decrease snoring intensity as measured by patient or bed partner report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. However, the effect does not appear to be long lasting, as demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>UPPP</strong> &ndash; Long-term subjective outcomes were assessed via questionnaire in 203 patients who had undergone UPPP for snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The immediate postoperative success rate (defined as a 50 percent or greater reduction in snoring by self-report) was 76 percent. By two years after surgery, the success rate had decreased to 45 percent. The majority of patients (62 percent) indicated that they would not have the surgery again if offered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>LAUP</strong> &ndash; A follow-up interview at 19 to 98 months post-surgery was performed in 122 patients who had undergone LAUP for snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Seventy-four percent of patients reported improvement at six weeks postoperative, 69 percent at nine months, and 55 percent at the time of the interview. Mean subjective improvement scores decreased from 57 percent at six weeks to 30 percent at the time of the interview.</p><p/><p>UPPP is initially painful and there are potential complications, including nasal reflux, pharyngeal stenosis, dysphonia, infection, bleeding, and transient velopharyngeal insufficiency. In addition, UPPP or LAUP may reduce snoring without eliminating the risk for OSA, potentially masking current or future OSA. </p><p>Patients who undergo UPPP require periodic evaluation by a sleep specialist to be evaluated for the development of OSA and to determine whether treatment is indicated.

In the only controlled trial, 26 patients with snoring were randomized to undergo radiofrequency palate surgery or sham surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Subjective snoring assessment at six to eight weeks post-procedure demonstrated greater improvement in snoring among patients who underwent radiofrequency palate surgery compared with those who underwent sham surgery; however, only two patients had a successful surgery as defined by near elimination of snoring. The remaining case series uniformly found improvement in snoring scores reported either by the patient or bed partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Among 39 patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation alone, only 17 percent felt that their condition was still improved compared with their preoperative baseline.

In all seven studies, subjective snoring was reduced postoperatively compared with preoperative baseline scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snoring-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Habitual snoring is common in adults, and occasional snoring is almost universal. Snoring can be a sign of a condition associated with increased upper airway resistance, or it can occur independently. (See <a href=\"#H3665407959\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snoring has been independently associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, but there is little evidence to support a relationship between snoring and either hypertension or ischemic heart disease. Disruption of the sleep of the bed partner may be a significant problem. (See <a href=\"#H1837184456\" class=\"local\">'Potential consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary reason to evaluate patients for snoring is to identify obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular comorbidities. If OSA is not identified, evaluation of the snoring may yield a treatable cause such as obesity, enlarged tonsils, deviated nasal septum, or chronic nasal congestion. (See <a href=\"#H1515032892\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative therapies should be encouraged for all patients who snore. These include smoking cessation, weight loss, alcohol avoidance several hours before bedtime, and sleeping in the lateral position. (See <a href=\"#H2401250001\" class=\"local\">'Conservative approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased nasal patency can contribute to snoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with chronic nasal congestion, we suggest a trial of intranasal glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients who respond may benefit from chronic intranasal glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H130689687\" class=\"local\">'Intranasal glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who continue to snore despite conservative therapy and relief of any nasal congestion, we suggest a trial of an external nasal dilator (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2045330979\" class=\"local\">'Nasal dilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nasal surgery is <strong>not</strong> recommended for most patients who snore and do not have OSA. An exception is patients who have significant anatomical obstruction (eg, septal deviation). (See <a href=\"#H545640687\" class=\"local\">'Nasal surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who continue to snore despite both conservative therapy and interventions to improve nasal patency, we suggest a trial of an oral appliance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Oral appliances should be fitted by a dentist with experience in treating sleep-related breathing disorders. (See <a href=\"#H3369016750\" class=\"local\">'Oral appliances'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other surgical approaches should be used as a last resort for patients who do not want to receive chronic mechanical therapy, such as an oral appliance, and who continue to snore despite both conservative therapy and interventions to improve nasal patency. Patients should be made aware that initial improvements in snoring are infrequently sustained over time.
