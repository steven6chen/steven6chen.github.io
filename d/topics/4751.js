These criteria require symptoms suggesting active NTM disease, imaging studies (HRCT) consistent with NTM pulmonary disease, and microbiologic identification of NTM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61404 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-negative patients&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>).

The microbiologic evaluation follows a stepwise approach, starting with examination of expectorated or induced sputum. If the results of sputum testing are negative and imaging is suspicious for NTM pulmonary disease, bronchoscopy should be performed, with bronchial washing or bronchoalveolar lavage targeted to lung regions appearing suspicious for NTM disease on HRCT. The microbiologic criteria for diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease require isolation of NTM from sputum on two occasions or from bronchial <span class=\"nowrap\">wash/alveolar</span> lavage on one occasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

If such treatment returns the patient to a baseline level of symptoms and lung function, NTM treatment may be deferred but with close follow-up. Unfortunately, eradication of NTM from airway secretions of CF patients is difficult to achieve, particularly in those infected with <em>M. abscessus</em>, and drug toxicities are frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The decision to initiate NTM therapy needs to be individualized for each patient based on assessment of risks and benefits and consultation with infectious diseases specialists with CF experience.

Isolates obtained from these widely scattered sites were found to have near-identical sequences. These findings led the authors to suggest worldwide person-to-person transmission of <em>M. abscessus</em> clones between CF patients. However, the study did not exclude another likely explanation for their findings, which is that the clones are distributed globally in the environment and that patients become infected from them locally without direct patient-to-patient transmission. Following publication of this article, the CFF has made no new recommendations beyond the existing guidelines, which are designed to limit spread of all infectious agents between CF patients.</p><p>To minimize risk of transmission, the CFF has published updated guidelines for infection prevention and control to be applied to all individuals with CF, regardless of respiratory tract culture results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

The clinical implications of detecting NTM in sputum samples of patients with CF are variable, but in some cases the infection is associated with declining pulmonary function and warrants treatment. All expectorating patients should have annual screening for NTM in sputum. Those testing positive and patients with a clinical suspicion of NTM pulmonary disease suggested by unexplained worsening of symptoms or pulmonary function test results should be further evaluated. For any patient taking chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> who screen positive for NTM or who is suspected of being infected with NTM, azithromycin should be temporarily held pending further evaluation to reduce the risk that monotherapy will induce resistance of the NTM to azithromycin. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Nontuberculous mycobacteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to antibiotics, optimal care for pulmonary disease in CF includes measures to promote airway clearance and to reduce bronchial obstruction and inflammation. Airway clearance therapies should be intensified during an acute pulmonary exacerbation. These approaches are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce transmission of pathogens, the CFF recommends the following measures for all CF patients, regardless of a patient's respiratory tract culture results (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Infection prevention and control'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinicians use contact precautions (gown and surgical masks) at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients wear surgical masks in the health care setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with CF should not congregate within or outside of the health care setting, should be separated by at least six feet, and inpatients with CF should be housed in single-patient rooms.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rommens JM, Iannuzzi MC, Kerem B, et al.
