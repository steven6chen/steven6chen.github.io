Although low in number, they are the main lymphocytes of the innate immune system in the peripheral blood. NK cells account for a minority of lymphocytes within organs in most cases, although there are important exceptions. In the duodenal epithelia and in the uterine decidua during pregnancy, NK cells account for up to 45 and 70 percent of lymphocytes, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Phenotypic characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cells differ phenotypically from other lymphocytes by the presence of large cytoplasmic granules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76027 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>NK cells do not display the same cell surface markers as other populations of lymphocytes; specifically, they do not have CD3, CD4, or CD19. Instead, the majority of NK cells (although not all) display the following surface molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD2 &ndash; The receptor for the adhesion molecule for lymphocyte function associated antigen 3 (LFA-3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD16 &ndash; The Fc-gamma-RIIIa receptor for IgG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD56 &ndash; A neural cellular adhesion molecule (NCAM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD335 &ndash; The natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46, a specific receptor for viral hemagglutinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p>Thus, NK cells are typically characterized as CD3-, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD16/56+</span>. The major population of peripheral blood NK cells expresses intermediate levels of CD56 and is thus referred to as &quot;CD56dim.&quot; A minor population (approximately 5 percent) of NK cells in the peripheral blood has very high expression of CD56 and is referred to as &quot;CD56bright.&quot; These two subsets have important functional and developmental differences. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Immunostimulation'</a> below.)</p><p>Approximately one-half of NK cells express CD8, although these are CD8 <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/alpha</span> homodimers, unlike the CD8 <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> heterodimers expressed on cytotoxic T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5022108\"><span class=\"h3\">Relationship to NKT cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cells are distinct from NKT cells. NKT cells are a subset of T lymphocytes. They are CD3+, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD16/CD56+</span> and rearrange their T cell receptor genes as do conventional T cells. There is a clinical entity of NKT cell deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and NKT cells are also deficient in a variety of other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. NKT cells are not discussed further in this review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important function of NK cells in the innate immune system is cellular killing, or cytotoxicity. Additional NK cell functions include cytokine and chemokine production, and costimulation of other immune cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6580232\"><span class=\"h3\">NK cell cytotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cell cytotoxicity is rapid and can be further induced quickly. During an acute viral infection, increased NK cell cytotoxicity is evident within three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. In contrast, unactivated cytotoxic T lymphocytes are not capable of cytotoxicity, and once activated by viral exposure, their numbers peak approximately one week later.</p><p>NK cells are considered part of the innate immune response because they act through receptors that are encoded in the germline DNA and do not undergo genetic recombination to attain specificity. This distinguishes them from lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system (ie, T, B cells, and NKT cells), which recombine DNA following exposure to antigen, and generate antigen-specific T cell receptors and immunoglobulins, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, NK cells can mediate the destruction of target cells based entirely upon interactions between ligands expressed by the target cell and cognate receptors present on the NK cell. This activity does not require interaction with the adaptive immune system and is also called &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;spontaneous&quot; cytotoxicity.</p><p>NK cells constantly survey surrounding cells for abnormalities, and rely upon the detection of various signatures of health to inhibit their potentially lethal functions. Restraining the activity of these cells are multiple families of cell-surface inhibitory receptors, of which the killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) family is the best characterized. These receptors are ligated by the class-I MHC molecules found on the surface of most nucleated cells, which identify the cell as &quot;healthy self.&quot; NK cell killing is inhibited if class-I MHC molecules are present in normal density. However, if class-I MHC is deficient or missing, activation receptor signaling overcomes inhibitory receptor signaling, and NK cell functions are triggered. Thus, NK cells detect and can be triggered to destroy cells that are &quot;missing self&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Tumor cells and cells that are infected with certain viruses downregulate surface class-I MHC molecules and are therefore recognized by NK cells as nonself and targeted for destruction. However, a variety of viruses have evolved to exploit this mechanism and escape NK cell-mediated defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. As examples, some viruses encode for the expression of class-I MHC decoy molecules, while others cause selective downregulation of those class-I MHC molecules that are most likely to engage cytotoxic T lymphocytes, while having minimal effect on the class-I MHC molecules detected by NK cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Avoidance of immune recognition'</a>.)</p><p>KIRs signal through cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Upon receptor ligation, tyrosines in these ITIMs are phosphorylated, allowing the recruitment of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatases (SHP). Recruited SHPs dephosphorylate a number of cellular targets to prevent NK cell activation directed at the target cell. The most notable is Vav-1, which is a direct requirement in the signaling leading to NK cell activation and cytotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In contrast to KIRs, which restrain the killing activity of NK cells, there are numerous other receptors on the surface of NK cells that are capable of recognizing target cell ligands and generating signals that will result in NK cell cytotoxicity. They all require surpassing a signaling threshold set by the negative signals arising from appropriately ligated inhibitory receptors. Some activating receptors are potent in their function, while others require the cooperative efforts of multiple receptors to achieve an appropriate signaling threshold. A few of the receptors, such as 2B4 (CD244), NKG2D, and LFA-1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(CD11a/CD18),</span> are involved in activation of NK cells as well as other cell types. Others are specific to NK cells, including the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NKp44 (CD336), which binds viral hemagglutinin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NKp46 (CD335), which binds viral hemagglutinin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NKp30 (CD337), which binds HLA-B-associated transcript 3 and H7-B6</p><p/><p>These receptors transmit intracellular signals through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) contained within a separate and required cytoplasmic signaling partner. The end result of activating receptor-driven signal cascades is usually intracellular calcium mobilization, which then enables the fusion and secretion of NK cell lytic granules with the NK cell membrane where it touches the target cell. This leads to secretion of lytic granule contents onto the target cell to promote cytotoxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6580441\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A well-characterized function of NK cells is antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This is a variation of NK cell cytotoxicity that cooperates with the humoral immune system to facilitate elimination of targets recognized by specific IgG.</p><p>CD16 (the Fc-gamma-RIIIa receptor) on the surface of the NK cell binds to the Fc portion of an IgG. IgG, in turn, is attached to a cell or organism through its antigen recognitions sites in the Fab portion. Unopposed, this interaction activates the NK cell, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of the target cell. However, as is the case with other types of cytotoxicity receptors, activation is countered by the presence of inhibitory receptors that keep the cytotoxic functions of the cell in check.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6580448\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of killing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC involve the release of lytic granule contents, which include the pore-forming molecule perforin, as well as cell death-inducing enzymes, such as granzyme serine esterases. While some evidence suggests that some lytic molecules can enter a target cell through a perforin pore, it is generally accepted that granzymes enter the target cell via perforin-facilitated endocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In NK cell cytotoxicity, these granules typically polarize to the portion of the NK cell that is in closest proximity to the target cell, and then the lytic granule contents are secreted into the space between the cells. The interface between the NK cell and target, as well as the molecular arrangements that occur at that site, are collectively referred to as the NK cell immunological synapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The organization, maturation, and function of the NK cell immunological synapse progresses in a stepwise manner and can be specifically affected by certain genetic diseases of the immune system, most notably the Congenital Hemophagocytic Syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Genetic disorders and other immunodeficiencies'</a> below.)</p><p>A third, distinct type of killing is mediated by interactions between death receptors, such as Fas on a target cell and the cognate ligand expressed on an NK cell (ie, FasL in this example). The ligation of Fas by FasL induces apoptosis in the target cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The kinetics of this type of NK cell killing are slower than that mediated by perforin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunostimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cells serve important roles in immune responses and host defense through their ability to produce and secrete various cytokines and chemokines. NK cells are best known for their ability to secrete interferon (IFN)-gamma after activation. This enables them to participate in antiviral responses through the direct and immunostimulatory properties of this cytokine. IFN-gamma produced by NK cells is also useful in activating macrophages and facilitating their respiratory burst.</p><p>NK cells also produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and under certain circumstances, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13. These latter two cytokines may facilitate humoral immunity, although they also suggest a possible pathogenic role for NK cells in asthma and atopic conditions.</p><p>All NK cells can produce immunostimulatory factors; however, the CD56bright NK cells are especially effective in this role. CD56bright NK cells do not express the cytolytic machinery and mediate cytotoxicity only weakly, although these cells are potent producers of cytokines. CD56bright NK cells are also considered to be developmentally immature and have been shown to be a developmental precursor to mature CD56dim lytic effector NK cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF NK CELL DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated natural killer (NK) cell deficiencies are disorders in which the <strong>only</strong> persistent immunologic deficit is that of NK cell number or function. By definition, individuals affected by these conditions do not have any other identifiable immunodeficiency disease and are not receiving medications that alter NK number or function. These disorders appear to be rare.</p><p>The NK cell deficiency syndromes can be divided into two types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD)</strong> &ndash; Individuals with CNKD lack NK cells as well as the activity mediated by NK cells (NK cell function). A patient with very low numbers of NK cells may also be classified as having CNKD if function is absent, particularly if the few cells present are all CD56bright (the type of NK cell that is not involved in cytotoxicity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD)</strong> &ndash; Individuals with FNKD possess NK cells, but have absent or severely decreased NK cell function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural killer (NK) cell deficiency or dysfunction is characterized clinically by severe, recurrent, or atypical herpes infections and papilloma viruses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50812 \">table 1</a>). The most commonly implicated herpes viruses in patients with these disorders include cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV), and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Classical NK cell deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the patients described to date with clear and convincing classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD) have died in childhood or adolescence. The disorder demonstrates the importance of NK cells in defense against specific viral infections, including VZV and other herpes viruses and CMV. Generalized Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) infection is also reported in some of these patients, perhaps due to impaired interferon-gamma production, although this has not been specifically studied.</p><p>Reports of patients with CNKD include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most cited case is that of an adolescent female who presented with disseminated and life-threatening VZV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. She had a prior history of recurrent otitis media and intermittent leukopenia, but was otherwise well. In late adolescence, she had life-threatening systemic CMV infection followed by disseminated HSV infection. The patient had evidence of normal specific antibody production and lymphocyte responsiveness, as she had high titer IgG against VZV in her serum and her peripheral blood lymphocytes produced IFN-gamma after stimulation and demonstrated proliferation in the presence of VZV. Consistently and repeatedly, it was found that the patient did not possess CD56+ or CD16+ lymphocytes. In addition, she completely lacked NK cell cytotoxicity, even when her lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with type-I IFN or IL-2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar phenotype was described in an adolescent male who initially presented with Salmonella enteritis and subsequently generalized MAI infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the midst of a successful antimycobacterial treatment, he died from disseminated VZV infection. He was ultimately found to lack NK cells and monocytes amongst peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). He also lacked NK cell cytotoxic activity. Despite this, he was capable of generating specific antibody and producing IFN-gamma and IL-12, and had normal cytotoxic T cell activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another case was reported in which a previously healthy 23 month old girl presented with severe disseminated VZV infection that resulted in her death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. She had normal proportions of B and T cells, as well as a proliferative response to T and B cell mitogens. Despite this, there was markedly decreased NK cytotoxicity, which could not be restored with preincubation with IL-2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A four year old girl with a similar phenotype also had disseminated VZV and was successfully treated using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other case reports include a patient with severe and recurrent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, another with extensive Trichophyton fungal infection, and a third with bilateral EBV positive smooth muscle tumors of the adrenal glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Patients had lymphocytes expressing CD56 (4 to 18 percent), but effectively none that were CD3-. Other T cell populations were normal. NK cell cytotoxicity was absent and could not be induced by IL-2 or type-I IFN stimulation in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Both patients had normal specific antibody production and lymphocyte proliferation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16717319\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis and genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There were several reports of familial cases prior to the identification of specific mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Subsequently, two mutations have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autosomal dominant GATA2 deficiency</strong> &ndash; An autosomal dominant mutation in the gene GATA2, which encodes a widely expressed transcription factor, has been identified in patients with classical NK cell deficiency type 1 (CNKD1). A large cohort of 18 patients was described, with what appeared to be CNKD in the context of low numbers of monocytes, especially B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Many of these patients had essentially no CD56+ NK cells. The low numbers of monocytes is intriguing, as monocytes also express CD56, albeit at low levels. Some of these cases were familial. Severe HPV infections, mycobacterial infections, and fungal infections were reported in 78, 78, and 28 percent of cases, respectively. Since the original description, these individuals have been defined as having dominant negative mutations in the GATA2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. A more detailed analysis of these patients was subsequently published and defined the defect as one leading to absence of NK cell function and a loss of CD56bright NK cells in those patients that have residual NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, GATA2 defects are also associated with other disorders, including primary lymphedema with myelodysplasia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. The mechanism linking the presumably pervasive GATA2 transcription factor to this unusual and specific immunological phenotype is presently unclear. It seems likely, however, that CNKD is one of the ways in which GATA2 deficiency can present clinically and immunologically. Other manifestations of GATA2 deficiency are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects#H3663155\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases: Specific defects&quot;, section on 'GATA2 deficiency (MonoMAC syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCM4 deficiency</strong> &ndash; Mutations in the minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 (MCM4), a DNA helicase that is involved in the unwinding and polymerization of chromosomal DNA, were identified in one large consanguineous family of Irish nomadic descent, although how these mutations lead to the observed clinical abnormalities is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One affected family member had EBV lymphoproliferation and two others had recurrent viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Linkage analysis, performed using multiple family members, defined 8p11.23-8q11.21 as a susceptibility locus. Subsequently, the genetic defect in these individuals was defined and there are now a total of three consanguineous cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. These individuals lack NK cells, but have a small number of CD56bright cells. They also have a profound somatic phenotype of adrenal insufficiency and growth retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. This disorder is listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM #609981) and has been termed classical NK cell deficiency type 2 (CNKD2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another report, two sisters were affected, the older of whom died from severe CMV infection. They had severe growth retardation and facial abnormalities, suggesting a syndromic immunodeficiency. They also had neutropenia and abnormalities in lymphocyte survival. The surviving sister was shown to have impaired lymphoid cell survival in response to IL-2 and IL-15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p>It is not yet known what percentage of CNKD cases is attributable to these two defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional NK cell deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNKD represents a more diverse diagnosis in which NK cells are present, but are persistently deficient in at least one of their functional activities.</p><p>The mechanism(s) underlying this form of deficiency is largely unknown, although in a few patients, defects in the gene coding for CD16 (Fc-gamma-RIIIa), called FCGR3A, have been identified. This is the only known single gene defect to give rise to an isolated NK cell deficiency (FNKD1). This mutation is informative because it connects a specific cell activity to the expression of a single gene that is relevant mainly to NK cells. CD16 is expressed on the vast majority of NK cells as well as some phagocytes. The function of CD16 on the surface of phagocytes is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with CD16 mutations are described in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several individuals have been reported who are homozygous for a T to A substitution at position 230 in FCGR3A, resulting in the substitution of a histidine at position 48 in the CD16 (referred to as the &quot;48H alteration&quot;). The resulting altered protein is expressed, but the structure is abnormal and it is no longer recognized by anti-CD16 clone B73.1, although it is still recognized by other anti-CD16 antibodies, such as 3G8.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The B73.1 antibody is available in the United States for clinical diagnostic use, but it is not commonly used by diagnostic laboratories as a single reagent. Rather, it is used in combination with an anti-CD56 antibody, and this combination of reagents will not distinguish the altered form of CD16 from the normal form because NK cells will appear to be present based upon their normal staining with anti-CD56. However, if testing is repeated using B73.1 and 3G8 separately, the cells will appear as B73.1 negative, 3G8 positive, thus identifying the abnormal form of CD16. An additional patient with this defect has been identified and had recurrent herpesvirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This report reevaluated the original patient and confirmed the stability of the defect over time. It also identified a mechanism underlying the unusual defect, which was the abrogation of an interaction between the distal extracellular domain of CD16 and other NK cell receptors (CD2 in particular).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A girl homozygous for the 48H alteration suffered from frequent upper respiratory infections and severe recurrent HSV stomatitis and herpetic whitlow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Interestingly, she had deficient NK cell cytotoxicity but normal antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), suggesting that CD16 plays a role in IgG-independent NK cell function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three other patients homozygous for the 48H alteration and suffering from progressive or disseminated herpesvirus infections have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The frequency of the CD16 48H allele may be quite high in certain populations (eg, Scandinavian Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]) and the true relation of the homozygous phenotype to the susceptibility and severity of herpesvirus disease remains a question. That said, a subsequent publication on this topic confirms the gene frequency to be rare in modern genomic databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p>Other individuals appear to have FNKD without an identifiable genetic etiology, as no NK cell-specific defect could be found. These patients suffered from recurrent viral infections and severe or invasive herpesvirus infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. All had otherwise normal immunologic phenotypes and normal demonstrable T cell and B cell function. None had other immunologic disorders that could potentially interfere with NK cell development, survival, or activity. In all cases, the NK cell defect was persistent in serial assessments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for a natural killer (NK) cell deficiency syndrome should be considered in patients with severe, recurrent, or atypical herpes infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50812 \">table 1</a>). It is a challenging diagnosis to make with certainty, as there are multiple known diseases and drugs that can suppress NK cell numbers or activities. Unfortunately, in most cases, the possibility of an NK cell defect is raised only after a severe, debilitating, or potentially irreversible infectious disease.</p><p>The diagnosis is based upon the demonstration that the patient has very few or no NK cells, low or absent NK cell function, or both. It is also important to demonstrate that an NK cell deficiency or defect persists over time and is present when the patient is both infected and well, because acute and extreme stress or depression can transiently affect NK cell activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Thus, the identified defect should be repeated and verified on three separate occasions, separated by at least one month each.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6582888\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful medical history and a thorough physical examination are essential both in gathering a history of appropriate infections and in detecting known conditions and medications that potentially impair NK cell function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> number. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and laboratory features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6582930\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for current and past infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathogens responsible for current or significant past infections should be identified whenever possible. Current infections are usually identified by culture or serologic tests. Methods of evaluating past infections include postexposure titers, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation or cytokine production in response to pathogen or pathogen-derived antigen exposure, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against allogeneic cells infected with the suspected organism. Pathogens of the herpesvirus family are most relevant to consider and knowing the past exposure history of a potentially NK cell deficient patient can be of value in facilitating future management of illnesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19284438\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe, recurrent, or atypical herpes infections should be referred to an expert in <span class=\"nowrap\">Allergy/Immunology</span> or Infectious Disease, with experience in evaluating the immune system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50812 \">table 1</a>). The initial evaluation includes flow cytometric tests to quantitate NK cells and other lymphocyte subsets, which are widely available, but advanced testing often requires referral to centers of expertise. Referral to a center of expertise should occur when the patient's presentation has been determined to be sufficiently abnormal to an experienced clinician in <span class=\"nowrap\">Allergy/Immunology</span> or Infectious Disease. Several centers have expertise in NK cell deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing of NK cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete blood count (CBC) with differential should be performed initially, although the CBC does not provide information about lymphocyte subsets.

Standard laboratory panels include CD4 and CD8 positive T cells, B cells, and NK cells.</p><p>To quantify NK (CD3-, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD56/16+),</span> most commercial laboratories in the United States use a combination of the B73.1 antibody with an anti-CD56 antibody. At least two repeat assessments should be performed, ideally when the patient is free of infection or major stress, to exclude a transient deficiency, as mentioned previously.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If NK cells were found to be low or absent, then the patient's lymphocytes should be tested for NK cytotoxicity, which would also be expected to be severely depressed or absent, confirming the diagnosis of a CNKD.</p><p/><p>If <span class=\"nowrap\">CD56/16+</span> cells are present, then cytotoxicity should still be assessed. If cytotoxicity is depressed, then the clinician should ascertain which monoclonal antibody reagents were used to identify NK cells, and obtain repeat flow cytometry with clones 3G8 and B73.1 in separate fluorescent channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60744 \">table 2</a>). If the 3G8 antibody detects CD16, but B73.1 does not, then the variant CD16 should be suspected. However, if the CD16 variant is not present, the patient may still have a FNKD, since the etiology of most of these cases is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Functional NK cell deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytotoxicity testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of NK cell function begins with cytotoxicity testing. A chromium release assay (using 51Cr) is the preferred method. This testing is available through many commercial laboratories, as well as several academic centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A variety of flow cytometry-based dye uptake and cell-death detection assays are also available and appear to be reasonable screens, but these tests are not as time-tested as the 51Cr-based assay. If cytotoxicity testing is abnormal, it should be repeated on three separate occasions, separated in time by at least one month:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If NK cells were found to be low or absent, and NK cytotoxicity is severely depressed or absent, the patient has a CNKD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If NK cells were found to be low or absent, but NK cytotoxicity is present, then the patient may have a phenotypically abnormal, but functional population. This is occasionally seen in some of the NK cell lymphocytoses, which are considered premalignant conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If NK cells were present, but NK cytotoxicity was severely depressed or absent, then functional NK cell deficiency is confirmed.

Testing with IL-2 also helps determine if IL-2 therapy would be potentially useful in that patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Interleukin-2'</a>.)</p><p>Determining the mechanism underlying an NK cell deficiency syndrome requires advanced techniques available in specialized and research laboratories, such as activation-induced CD107a expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], granule release, conjugate formation, or others. These tests can better define deficiencies in cytolytic function and differential responses to cytokines. The CD107a assay has been the topic of substantive investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] and is a useful surrogate for cytotoxicity, although it measures degranulation and not killing. Degranulation and killing can be disconnected, such as in the case of perforin deficiency, where CD107a upregulation is normal after activation, but killing is absent.</p><p>Further investigations that are mostly performed on a research basis can include detailed NK cell phenotype to determine the specific presence or absence of NK cell surface receptors that may be critical for regulation of NK cell functions, and functions mediated through specific receptors on NK cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60744 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19284519\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutational analysis for known genetic defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient appears to have CNKD, mutational analysis of the GATA2 and MCM4 genes is appropriate.

These disorders may impact NK cell development, survival, or specific function.</p><p>NK cell numbers are decreased or absent in disorders affecting NK cell development or survival. An example is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to mutation of the common gamma chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Most of these disorders have recognizable characteristics or immunologic defects of other cell types. In some of these diseases, it is accepted that an NK cell deficiency contributes to the clinical phenotype, such as in familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (a subtype of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In others, such as the radiation hypersensitivity syndromes like Bloom syndrome, the contribution of an NK cell deficiency to the clinical course is unknown.</p><p>Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common primary immunodeficiency disorder that can affect NK cell function. Although only a subset of CVID cases have defects in NK cell function, CVID should be entertained in patients with isolated NK cell deficiency because of its relative frequency in the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

They have large cytoplasmic granules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76027 \">picture 1</a>) and are CD3-, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD16/56+</span> upon flow cytometric analysis. NK cells produce IFN-gamma, which activates macrophages and facilitates their respiratory burst. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Phenotypic characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Immunostimulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NK cells constantly survey surrounding cells for abnormalities and kill those cells that fail to display various signatures of health, particularly virally-infected and malignant cells. Multiple families of inhibitory receptors on the surface of NK cells, including the killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs), act to restrain the destructive potential of these cells. NK cell cytotoxicity is rapid compared with the responses of other lymphocytes and peaks approximately three days after viral infection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Functions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6580448\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of killing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NK cell deficiency syndromes are rare disorders in which either the number, function, or both of NK cells is abnormal, in the absence of any other immune deficiency, medication, or other condition known to affect NK cells. These syndromes can be divided into two types: classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD) and functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Classification of NK cell deficiency syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NK cell disorders are characterized clinically by susceptibility to severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent infection with herpes viruses (especially varicella zoster virus [VZV], herpes simplex viruses I and II [HSVI and II], Epstein Barr virus [EBV], and cytomegalovirus [CMV]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50812 \">table 1</a>). Most of the patients reported to date have died in childhood or adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and laboratory features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two genetic defects that cause CNKD have been identified: an autosomal dominant mutation in the gene GATA2, and mutations in the minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 (MCM4). (See <a href=\"#H16717319\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for an NK cell deficiency syndrome should be considered in patients with severe, recurrent, or atypical infections with herpesviruses. Testing involves identification of NK cells, followed by functional testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60744 \">table 2</a>).

At least three repeat assessments of the deficiency should be performed when the patient is free of infection or major stress, to exclude a transient deficiency. The NK deficiency should then be confirmed by ex vivo cytotoxicity testing of the patient's lymphocytes, which would be expected to be absent. (See <a href=\"#H6582941\" class=\"local\">'Quantification of NK cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If NK cells are low or absent, then the patient's lymphocytes should be tested for NK cell function (preferably by chromium release assay), which would be expected to be accordingly low or absent, confirming the diagnosis of CNKD.
