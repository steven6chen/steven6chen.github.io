All of the antipsychotic medications have the potential for causing EPS. They are common with some antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thiothixene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiothixene</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trifluoperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trifluoperazine</a>), and uncommon with others (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloperidone</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28219031\"><span class=\"h2\">Akathisia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Akathisia is the most common form of EPS. It usually presents as motor restlessness with a compelling urge to move and an inability to sit still. Individuals with milder akathisia may describe a subjective feeling of restlessness but not show restless motor behavior. If patients do not demonstrate restless behaviors, the examiner should inquire if they pace frequently or if they have difficulty sitting still. </p><p>When akathisia is present, our first intervention is a cautious reduction in antipsychotic dose, if feasible, with close monitoring of the patient for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. If decreasing the antipsychotic drug dose is not feasible or inadequate, we suggest medication treatment.</p><p>Beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a>, and benzodiazepines have shown some evidence of efficacy in small clinical trials of akathisia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Our and others&rsquo; long clinical experience with these agents suggests that each can be helpful for some patients. Our first-line choice among these agents was a benzodiazepine until the publication of two 2016 studies reported associations between benzodiazepine use and mortality in schizophrenia patients (below). Instead, we would use a beta blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> to treat akathisia first-line and benztropine second-line. Benzodiazepines remain an option, particularly in patients who do not respond to a beta blocker or benztropine. Small trials of the antidepressant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> also suggest efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but fewer years of clinical experience have accumulated to assess its use.</p><p>Summary of the clinical trials with the suggested medications and guidance for administering them are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta blockers</strong> &ndash; Three small trials, two of them randomized, with a total of 32 schizophrenia patients found mixed results for beta blockers in the treatment of akathisia compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> is started at 10 mg orally twice daily. If the symptoms do not resolve and the patient has not experienced side effects, propranolol can be incrementally increased to 40 mg twice daily. Blood pressure should be monitored with the use of a beta blocker. Beta blockers are contraindicated in patients with airway diseases such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as patients with heart failure. Common side effects include fatigue, syncope, and light headedness. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Benztropine</a> &ndash; The efficacy of benztropine in antipsychotic-induced akathisia is supported by a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 28 schizophrenia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Benztropine can be started at 1 mg twice daily and increased up to 2 mg twice daily. Patients receiving benztropine should be monitored for anticholinergic effects including dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and memory impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> &mdash; Two small randomized trials with a total of 26 patients with schizophrenia found benzodiazepine treatment to reduce symptoms of akathisia compared to placebo (number needed to treat [NNT] = 1.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> can be started at 0.5 mg orally twice daily and increased incrementally up to 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Since benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are associated with sedation, withdrawal seizures, a potential for addiction, and tolerance, patients should receive the lowest dose that reduces akathisia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of benzodiazepines for akathisia needs to be weighed against findings of two 2016 longitudinal, retrospective studies that reported associations between benzodiazepine use and mortality in schizophrenia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, a national registry study of 21,492 Swedish adults with schizophrenia,&nbsp;age&nbsp;16 to 65 years, found the patients' cumulative&nbsp;benzodiazepine use&nbsp;to be associated with their all-cause mortality between 2006 and 2010 (hazard ratio = 1.74 95% CI = 1.50-2.03]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The study design did not allow for the determination of causality; unmeasured variation among patients (eg,&nbsp;in illness severity or comorbidity) may have contributed to the results.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28219038\"><span class=\"h2\">Parkinsonian syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary parkinsonism consists of mask-like facies, resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, shuffling gait, and psychomotor retardation (bradykinesia). Moderate or severe parkinsonism is usually obvious to an examiner. Milder parkinsonism can usually be diagnosed by examining for cog wheel rigidity or observing for a diminished arm swing when the patient walks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Cardinal manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Parkinsonism secondary to antipsychotics can be treated with an anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medication. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Benztropine</a> may be started at 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in divided doses. Doses of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are often effective in treating antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, but if necessary the dose can be increased gradually every three to four days to 6 or 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> if tolerated. Anticholinergic medications such as benztropine can lead to dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and memory impairment. Anticholinergics should be used cautiously in patients with glaucoma and in those with cognitive impairments. </p><p>If the patient is on an anticholinergic antipsychotic or does not tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a>, a non-anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medication may be used, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, 100 mg orally two to three times daily. Amantadine can cause hypotension and mild agitation. &#160;</p><p>Prophylactic use of antiparkinsonian agents is not generally recommended to prevent antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, though it may be useful in patients treated with high-potency, first-generation antipsychotics who have a known history of sensitivity to EPS or are treated with relatively high doses (eg, greater than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or the equivalent dose of other antipsychotics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28219045\"><span class=\"h2\">Dystonias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute dystonias are involuntary contractions of major muscle groups, and are characterized by symptoms such as torticollis, retrocollis, oculogyric crisis, and opisthotonos. These are usually rapid in onset and highly disturbing to patients. An extremely rare dystonia, laryngospasm, can be life threatening. Risk factors for dystonia include young age, male sex, use of cocaine, and a history of acute dystonic reaction. </p><p>Dystonias that are very disturbing can be treated with 1 to 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a> or 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> daily, administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Milder dystonias can be treated with oral benztropine 1 to 2 mg once or twice daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The emergence of a dystonia should lead to a reevaluation of the patient's antipsychotic regimen. After acute treatment of the dystonia, the preferred intervention is changing to an antipsychotic with a lower liability for EPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a>). If changing the antipsychotic is not an option, adding an anticholinergic antiparkinson medication such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a> 1 to 2 mg by mouth twice daily may be effective.</p><p>Prophylactic treatment with an anticholinergic agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>) is recommended to prevent an acute dystonic reaction in patients who receive intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> (eg, in the treatment of acute agitation or psychosis). Prophylactic treatment is particularly important in individuals with little prior exposure to antipsychotics. As an example, intramuscular haloperidol 5 or 10 mg can be accompanied by intramuscular benztropine 1 or 2 mg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H893411288\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients starting an antipsychotic medication should be evaluated for EPS weekly until the medication dose has been stable for at least two weeks. Two weekly assessments should also follow any significant dose increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Once the patient&rsquo;s dosage has been stabilized, the frequency of EPS assessment should depend on the patient&rsquo;s sensitivity to EPS and the EPS liability of their antipsychotic.

These movements seldom occur after less than six months of treatment and usually occur after years of treatment. The movements that characterize TD are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sucking, smacking of lips</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choreoathetoid movements of the tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial grimacing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral jaw movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choreiform or athetoid movements of the extremities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> truncal areas</p><p/><p>Patients who experience EPS during acute treatment appear to be at a greater risk for developing TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Other risk factors for TD among patients taking antipsychotic drugs include older age, longer duration of antipsychotic drug exposure and use of anticholinergic-antiparkinson drugs. Most of these associations are based on prevalence rather than incidence studies; thus, their role as risk factors for TD is not firmly established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for TD'</a>.)</p><p>Patients on an antipsychotic medication should be evaluated for TD regularly, at least annually. Patients taking drugs known to have a high risk of EPS or TD should be evaluated every six months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Elderly patients are at a higher risk for TD and should be evaluated more frequently.

While the patient is sitting, the clinician observes whether there are abnormal movements in the face, mouth, jaw, and the extremities. The tongue is observed with the mouth open. While standing, the patient is observed for abnormal movements of the trunk. Clinicians may choose to use the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for documenting the results of the examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F51103\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef51103 \">form 1</a>). The AIMS includes both a standardized examination and a system for rating abnormal movements.</p><p>When patients develop TD, clinicians should re-evaluate the current treatment strategy. Changing patients to an antipsychotic with a low risk for TD such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> may be a useful strategy for some individuals.

These side effects are more commonly seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, and less commonly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>. (See <a href=\"#H28219059\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All patients receiving antipsychotic medication should receive regular measurements of body mass index, waist circumference, serum lipids, and either fasting blood glucose (FBG) or hemoglobin A1c. These assessments should be performed when starting a new medication and regular intervals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F74435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74435 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies for managing weight gain and other metabolic problems include changing antipsychotics, diet and exercise counseling or behavioral intervention, symptomatic treatment (eg, with statins or antihypertensives), or use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> for weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H28219066\" class=\"local\">'Clinical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-generation antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a> can elevate plasma prolactin. This elevation can lead to galactorrhea and menstrual disturbances in women as well as sexual dysfunction and gynecomastia in men. This side effect can usually be managed by changing to a medication that is less likely to elevate prolactin. (See <a href=\"#H28219073\" class=\"local\">'Prolactin elevation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia#H87853791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Drug induced'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other, less common side effects of antipsychotic drugs include seizures, orthostatic hypotension, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, QT prolongation, and sudden death. Some antipsychotics cause sedation and anticholinergic effects.
