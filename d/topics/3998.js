However, oxidative stress is unlikely to be the sole mediator of cardiomyocyte damage, as treatment with scavengers of ROS have not consistently prevented doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Later studies implicate the topoisomerase-II (Top2) enzyme. In cancer cells, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> targets the enzyme Top2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Doxorubicin binds both Top2 and DNA to form the ternary Top2-doxorubicin-DNA cleavage complex, which triggers cell death. Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes express Top2-beta, but not Top2-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Top2-beta-doxorubicin-DNA complex can induce DNA double-strand breaks, leading to cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The hypothesis that doxorubicin-mediated cardiomyopathy is mediated by Top2-beta in cardiomyocytes is supported by murine studies showing that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the gene <em>Top2b</em> (which encodes the Top2-beta enzyme) protects cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced DNA double-strand breaks and transcriptome changes that are responsible for the formation of reactive oxygen species, and protects mice from the development of doxorubicin-induced progressive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other mechanisms proposed to contribute to anthracycline cardiotoxicity include mitochondrial iron accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and dysregulation of cardiomyocyte autophagy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3612148146\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standardized definition of what constitutes anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is lacking. The absence of standardized criteria impacts the frequency and timeliness of diagnosis. Our approach to diagnosis of anthracycline cardiotoxicity is described below. (See <a href=\"#H2928527637\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>In clinical practice, cases of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy have been most commonly identified by diagnosis of new-onset heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> detection of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in exposed individuals. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most common measure of LV function employed for detection of cardiotoxicity, although the threshold used to identify LVEF depression has varied. </p><p>However, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of clinical management of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity based largely upon detection of a decline in LVEF or symptoms and signs of HF. Cardiotoxicity is a broader condition than cardiac dysfunction (reflected by a depressed LVEF) since it includes any cardiac injury resulting from toxin exposure. Data show that significant cardiac injury can occur without a clear reduction in LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other limitations of LVEF are that it is affected by transient conditions such as preload, afterload, and adrenergic state, and is subject to interpretive variation. While our approach to diagnosis of cardiotoxicity continues to be largely based upon LVEF, other earlier and more sensitive markers may be helpful in raising concern and may trigger increased monitoring of LVEF. Some of the additional methods for detection of cardiotoxicity beyond LVEF include serum biomarker levels, myocardial strain (a measure of deformation) using echocardiography, and detection of myocardial fibrosis using cardiac magnetic resonance, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3915945712\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3780347397\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for anthracycline cardiac toxicity include older age (ie, age &gt;65 years) or very young age (ie, age &lt;4 years old), female gender, preexisting cardiovascular disorders (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &le;50 percent), hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and high cumulative anthracycline exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Additional risk factors include radiation therapy involving the chest as well as use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>. Recognition of these risk factors, and response to them by using non-anthracycline chemotherapy when appropriate, has diminished the incidence of anthracycline-induced heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-trastuzumab-and-other-her2-targeted-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cumulative anthracycline exposure is a consistent risk factor. The risk for doxorubicin-related HF ranges from 0.2 to 100 percent for cumulative doses ranging from 150 to 850 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/18-20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20,23</a>]. When cardiotoxicity is defined to include development of asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction, rates of cardiotoxicity are higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109645 \">table 1</a>). In one study, the rate of doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction (either symptomatic or asymptomatic but with a decline in EF) was 6.5, 8.8, 17.9, and 32.4 percent at cumulative doses of 150, 250, 350, and 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While limited data are available on the prognosis of an asymptomatic decline in the LVEF among patients treated with anthracyclines, studies of various populations of patients with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction have identified increased risk of HF and cardiovascular death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction#H1063218009\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Evidence suggests that obesity is associated with likelihood of developing cardiac dysfunction after anthracyclines. For example, in a meta-analysis of 15 studies including approximately 8700 breast cancer patients treated with either anthracyclines or sequential anthracyclines and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, the odds ratio (OR) for overweight patients (those with body mass index [BMI] &gt;25) for cardiac dysfunction was 1.38 (95% CI 1.06-1.80) relative to those with BMI &lt;25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A higher magnitude of risk was observed among those who were obese (BMI &ge;30; OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.95-2.28). Although this difference was not significant, this analysis consisted of far fewer patients compared with the one that included overweight patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3033830258\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4049091712\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding of the onset and frequency of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is limited given scant available prospective surveillance data in exposed patients. Reported prevalence rates of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity are influenced by how cardiotoxicity or cardiac dysfunction is detected or defined, patient risk factors for development of cardiomyopathy, and the duration of the follow-up period after anthracycline exposure. </p><p>Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has traditionally been classified into acute or early effects (traditionally considered reversible effects occurring during treatment), subacute (effects detected within a year of exposure), and chronic (effects detected years after exposure) disease processes. This classification system is likely arbitrary and is based largely upon observations from retrospective studies reporting development of heart failure (HF) in patients treated with anthracyclines. </p><p>While in the traditional model, early injury is considered to be largely reversible, evidence suggests that treatment with anthracyclines initiates a process of progressive injury starting at the time of exposure that continues for months to years. For example, large studies have documented a significant early increase in serum troponin among 30 to 35 percent of anthracycline-treated patients and have linked early increases in cardiac troponin to subsequent reductions in traditional measures of cardiotoxicity such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Cardiotoxicity, as manifest by a reduction in LVEF, can also be detected early as shown by a prospective study of 2625 patients receiving anthracycline-containing chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. LVEF was assessed at baseline, every three months during chemotherapy and for the following year, every six months for the following four years, and yearly thereafter with median follow-up of 5.2 years (interquartile range, 2.6 to 8 years). Cardiotoxicity in this study was defined as an LVEF &lt;50 percent and decrease in LVEF of &gt;10 percentage points from baseline. The overall incidence of cardiotoxicity was 9 percent. The median time of onset cardiotoxicity after the end of chemotherapy was 3.5 months (interquartile range, three to six months), and 98 percent of cardiotoxicity was detected within the first year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2109774867\"><span class=\"h2\">Early manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of acute anthracycline cardiotoxicity include electrocardiographic abnormalities, arrhythmias (supraventricular or ventricular), atrioventricular block, and a pericarditis-myocarditis syndrome (particularly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/8,17,27-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,27-35</a>]. Additionally, some patients develop early evidence of ventricular dysfunction with or without symptoms and signs of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/26,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,36</a>]. </p><p>Higher rates of early cardiotoxicity have been reported in individuals over 50 years old. Data are lacking on the potential contributory role of alternate or concurrent cardiovascular conditions, such as coronary artery disease.</p><p>In a German cohort of 1697 patients aged 18 to 75 years old receiving a doxorubicin-based regimen for lymphoma, 55 (3.2 percent) developed evidence of acute cardiotoxicity; among 44 cases reviewed in detail, complications included atrial fibrillation (n = 12), acute HF (n = 5), myocarditis (n = 2), and myocardial infarction (n = 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Higher rates of subacute toxicity have been reported in studies of older adults receiving CHOP or a CHOP-like regimen for treatment of lymphoma; in two such studies, rates of cardiotoxicity (decline in LVEF, atrial fibrillation, acute pulmonary edema, cardiac ischemia) during chemotherapy were 11 and 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. </p><p>Studies suggest that early manifestations of myocardial injury (such as troponin elevation or mild ventricular dysfunction) may predict future development of ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the 2625-patient prospective study discussed above, LVEF measured at the end of chemotherapy was an independent correlate of later development of cardiotoxicity (defined as LVEF &lt;50 percent and decrease in LVEF of &gt;10 percentage points from baseline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, further data are needed to determine the predictive value of early signs of cardiotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H3771029378\" class=\"local\">'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465476254\"><span class=\"h2\">Late manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late clinical manifestations of anthracycline cardiotoxicity include symptoms and signs of HF such as dyspnea, fatigue, edema, and orthopnea. Depressed LVEF may be detected with or without HF. As noted above, the distinction between early and late manifestations may be somewhat arbitrary since early subclinical cardiac injury may lead to LV dysfunction and HF detected later. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The overall prevalence of late symptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity varies widely depending on the age of the population treated; the dose of anthracycline; hematologic cancer; presence of cardiovascular risk factors; history of heart disease, including low or impaired LVEF before chemotherapy; and the length of follow-up and the definitions used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/18,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,40,41</a>]. In adults, symptomatic HF appears to occur predominantly within two to three years of anthracycline exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In a study of 135 patients with a median age of 59 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who were treated with anthracyclines, 20 percent developed a significant cardiac event within one year of treatment. Older data suggest that the prognosis of symptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is poor, with greater than 60 percent mortality at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>The prevalence of asymptomatic LV dysfunction depends on the population, methods, and definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]; however, the prevalence is much higher than symptomatic disease, with reported rates varying from 7 percent using LVEF to 45 percent using cardiac strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. For example, in an echocardiographic study of 1853 adult survivors of childhood cancer with a median age of 31 years, an asymptomatic reduction in LVEF to &lt;50 percent was noted in 7 percent of participants, and nearly all of these patients were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Similarly, in a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging study among 114 adult survivors of childhood cancer who were free of cardiovascular symptoms, the prevalence was 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a CMR study of adults treated with low to moderate doses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 26 percent of subjects had an asymptomatic reduction to LVEF &lt;50 percent at six months after anthracycline exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Identification of cardiotoxicity late after exposure has been described mainly in survivors of childhood cancers. The latent period between exposure and identification of a cardiomyopathy could be as long as 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Compared with sibling controls, survivors of childhood cancer have a nearly sixfold greater risk of developing HF (largely attributed to anthracycline exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3915945712\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3487416073\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for baseline risk assessment, monitoring, and early detection of cardiotoxicity in patients who are treated with anthracyclines is that early detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity and intervention can decrease the risk of progression to heart failure (HF) and thus improve quality of life and outcomes. For patients deemed to be at highest risk of developing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and HF, individualized risk-benefit analysis may include consideration of alternatives to anthracycline therapy. Risk factors are discussed elsewhere.

Given the limited available data, the authors recommend the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical history, cardiac examination, and electrocardiogram should be performed in all individuals prior to initiation of anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and patients should have a repeat clinical history and examination at least every three months by a clinician during the treatment course.

The baseline assessment may identify individuals at risk for HF for whom alternatives to anthracycline therapy should be considered.

Since significant cardiac injury can occur without a clear reduction in LVEF, earlier and more sensitive markers of cardiotoxicity have been sought.

A number of studies have explored the utility of strain and strain rate imaging in the detection of cancer therapy-induced cardiac toxicity and in the prediction of subsequent decreases in LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/45,60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,60-62</a>].

In comparison with strain evaluation, measurement of strain rate is less influenced by physiological conditions and strain rate measurements in expert hands may be more sensitive than strain to early changes in cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, due to measurement variability, the routine use of strain rate appears to be more challenging in clinical practice and therefore most studies have focused on the use of strain imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Strain can be measured in the longitudinal, circumferential, or radial direction with GLS identified as the optimum parameter for early detection of cardiotoxicity.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Determining the cause and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2435400478\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anthracyclines appear to affect cardiac function mainly through mechanisms that involve reactive oxygen species formation, induction of apoptosis, DNA damage through interaction with topoisomerase II, and inhibition of protein synthesis. (See <a href=\"#H3649686908\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of standardized criteria to define anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity impacts the frequency and timeliness of diagnosis. Although identification of cardiac dysfunction (particularly as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) is a common means of identifying cardiotoxicity, it is important to distinguish cardiac dysfunction from cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity is a broader term that includes cardiac injury beyond a reduction in LVEF. (See <a href=\"#H3612148146\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has traditionally been classified into acute (generally reversible effects occurring during treatment), subacute (effects detected within a year of exposure), and chronic (effects detected years after exposure) disease processes. An alternative, more plausible paradigm has been proposed in which anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity reflects a continuous process that starts during exposure and may be detected at early or late stages as the condition evolves. (See <a href=\"#H4049091712\" class=\"local\">'Time course'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rationale for baseline risk assessment, monitoring, and early detection of cardiotoxicity in patients who are treated with anthracyclines is that early detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity and intervention may decrease the risk of progression to heart failure and thus improve quality of life and outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3915945712\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline assessment and monitoring of patients treated with anthracyclines includes baseline and follow-up clinical evaluation and cardiac imaging (generally echocardiography) during and following completion of anthracycline therapy. After completion of anthracycline therapy, monitoring should include at least an annual review of systems and physical exam to assess for cardiomyopathy. In the absence of symptoms or physical findings, the utility of routine imaging or blood work is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H508413557\" class=\"local\">'Approach to baseline assessment and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is typically confirmed in a patient with history of anthracycline exposure by cardiac imaging (most commonly echocardiography) that confirms the presence of LV systolic dysfunction (generally by detection of depressed LVEF) and excludes other causes.
