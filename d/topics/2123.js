The effectiveness of self-monitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes who do not use hypoglycemic agents is less certain.</p><p>In addition to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), periodic measurement of glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is the accepted means of estimating chronic glycemic control. Several practical points about SMBG will be reviewed here, including the accuracy of glucose meters and glucose test strips, the accuracy of the operator, the efficacy and reliability of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, and how to use the glucose information that is obtained. The use of A1C measurements to estimate mean blood glucose is reviewed elsewhere.

Devices to sample the glucose continuously from interstitial fluid are also available, with ongoing development in progress. Most continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices still require some SMBG testing for calibration and to double-check high and low CGM values. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the results of randomized trials, we suggest SMBG in patients who take medications that can cause hypoglycemia and that need to be adjusted based on ambient glucose levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 1 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMBG is an integral part of intensive therapy aimed at achieving near-normal glycemia in type 1 diabetes, which is widely accepted as recommended therapy owing to its benefits. Ideally, testing at home should be done four to seven times daily (before and 90 to 120 minutes after meals, before bedtime, and, occasionally for safety, at 3 AM). Additionally, it is useful to test blood glucose levels before, during, and after exercise. Patients with hypoglycemia unawareness may need to test more frequently, particularly prior to driving or operating any machinery, watching small children, and other activities where compromise of cognitive function may be dangerous.</p><p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) endorses SMBG in type 1 diabetes as noted above and, in addition, when low blood glucose is suspected and after treating low blood glucose (until glucoses are normal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For most patients with type 1 diabetes, testing blood glucose levels this frequently is necessary to safely achieve A1C targets without frequent or severe hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring allows adjustments of doses and timing of insulin and of timing and content of meals and snacks based on immediate feedback of glucose results, and it also allows timely intervention for low or decreasing glucose levels to avert serious hypoglycemic events. SMBG is also important for patients with type 1 diabetes who are not managed with intensive therapy, although they may require somewhat less frequent testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes, while most often less than for patients with type 1 diabetes, is dependent on the glycemic targets set and the treatments used. We suggest SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes who take medications that can cause hypoglycemia and that need to be adjusted based on ambient glucose levels. However, glucose levels are characteristically more stable in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, and such patients usually require less frequent monitoring than in type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=case-illustrating-blood-glucose-monitoring-in-type-2-diabetes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Case illustrating blood glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients treated with sulfonylureas or meglitinides, which can also cause hypoglycemia, should be tested once to twice per day during titration of their doses but, after a stable dose and target glycemic targets are achieved, may only need to test several times per week, usually in the morning or before dinner. All patients taking insulin or sulfonylureas need to test more frequently before driving and during long periods of driving, on sick days, and when there are changes in diet and exercise patterns.</p><p>SMBG may not be necessary at all (or only in unusual circumstances) for patients with type 2 diabetes who are diet treated or who are treated with oral agents not associated with hypoglycemia. In addition, it may be unnecessarily burdensome in frail, older individuals with cognitive impairment or difficulty with fine motor skills from neurologic or musculoskeletal conditions. In such patients, the target for A1C should be somewhat higher (&le;8 percent) than for younger and more fit older patients, and therefore, there usually is less of a role for regular SMBG, unless the patient is taking insulin. Glycemic targets are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the older patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effectiveness of SMBG in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (especially those not receiving insulin) is less clear than for type 1 diabetes. Meta-analyses of randomized trials report conflicting results, with one reporting no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Subsequent analyses, limited to trials evaluating SMBG in patients not treated with insulin (ie, only diet or oral agents), reported a modest decrease in A1C in the SMBG group compared with no SMBG (pooled mean difference -0.2 to -0.3 percent at six months of follow-up) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. This small difference over such a brief duration is of uncertain clinical significance. In another meta-analysis that included patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral agents or once-daily, long-acting insulin, there was a larger reduction in A1C (-0.5 percent) with SMBG compared with no SMBG, particularly when SMBG was combined with patient education and feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are not data showing that SMBG affects quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or long-term, clinically important outcomes (eg, diabetes complications). In one study of newly diagnosed patients, SMBG was associated with higher scores on a depression scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Studies of SMBG have several potential biases. Patients who adhere to self-monitoring may have better lifestyle compliance as well or may have worse glucose control and, therefore, are more motivated. Patients who are less motivated may not be willing to participate in randomized studies, so randomized trials represent a selected patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Monitoring blood glucose is a tool, not a therapeutic intervention. It provides important information with which motivated patients can modify their behavior and improve their A1C values safely by reducing hypoglycemia risk (see <a href=\"#H121045045\" class=\"local\">'Using the information'</a> below). As an example, SMBG may be useful for some type 2 diabetic patients who would take action to modify eating patterns or exercise, as well as be willing to intensify pharmacotherapy based on SMBG results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, SMBG is expensive. In an economic analysis of SMBG in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes using data from a United Kingdom trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], SMBG was associated with diminished initial quality of life and was considered unlikely to be cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood glucose meters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of SMBG systems available. Most glucose meters are reasonably accurate (&plusmn;10 percent) and require only a very small drop of blood. In an evaluation of the accuracy of 27 monitoring systems, 16 fulfilled minimum accuracy requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In an analysis of seven commonly used meters, the imprecision ranged from 1.1 to 4.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, accuracy during episodes of hypoglycemia and in patients with poor peripheral tissue perfusion may be less than optimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Although glucose meters measure capillary blood glucose, almost all available glucose meters provide plasma equivalent values rather than whole-blood glucose values. Thus, results from most available glucose meters and commercial laboratories should be comparable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose strips</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some glucose strips have considerable batch-to-batch variation and require recalibration to a meter every time a new batch is used. Many strips are packaged in groups (10, 25, 50, or 100) inside a canister containing a desiccant to control humidity. Common errors include leaving the lid off for periods of time (with exposure to heat, moisture, and humidity) and mixing lots of strips into one can for convenience. Patients may forget to match the code on the strip bottle to the meter code, with uncompensated batch variation causing erroneous glucose value readings. Fortunately, most meters now have eliminated the need to code each bottle of strips. Most newer meters overcome this problem by automatically recognizing codes for strips.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several blood glucose meters are now available that use sites other than the finger to obtain blood samples in an effort to reduce the discomfort involved with fingersticks. A study of one device that can be used to obtain samples from the arm found that it provided accurate results and was less painful than fingerstick testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Monitoring from alternate sites, such as the skin of the forearm, may give slightly lower results than those taken at the fingertips since they may sample venous blood rather than capillary blood. While this should not be a problem if the patient uses one or the other site exclusively, the between-test variability will increase if numerous sites (such as fingertips and forearm sites) are used. In addition, during times when the blood glucose concentration is either rising rapidly (such as immediately after food ingestion) or falling rapidly (in response to rapidly acting insulin or exercise), blood glucose results from alternate sites may give significantly delayed results compared with fingerstick readings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54372\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54372 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2092660720\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential errors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Errors in SMBG are most frequently attributed to operator error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Problems arise from failure to use test strips appropriate to the meters or calibrate the meter correctly, dirty meters, inadequate hand washing, or improper storage of the test strips.</p><p>Patients who are motivated and test often usually get much more reliable results than those who are less interested or who test less often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>We also recommend the following steps to increase the accuracy of glucose monitoring:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glucose meter and strips should be brought in for clinic visits. The patient's method of testing should be observed periodically and any technical mistakes corrected. Patients should be queried regarding storage of strips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If SMBG results do not seem consistent with expectations, we recommend that the patient bring the glucose meter in to be checked against meters of known accuracy or with a simultaneous lab value.</p><p/><p>Glucose data from most meters can be downloaded using widely available software, so that the actual measurements can be reviewed (rather than relying on patients' self-report of frequency of testing and specific results). Review of downloaded measurements allows for more accurate review of data than may be available from patient recall. When using downloaded data, it is important to appreciate that the time and date in the meter often need to be reset and corrected.

However, the improvement in glycemic control compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is variable, CGM is relatively expensive, and, because of reliability issues and the need to calibrate most CGM devices, CGM does not eliminate the need for at least occasional fingersticks. (See <a href=\"#H4015626037\" class=\"local\">'CGM systems'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cost'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106161347\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient selection is a key factor for the successful use of CGM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For maximum benefit of CGM, patients must understand the technology and use CGM on a near daily basis.

In particular, the Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend CGM in adults with type 1 diabetes with A1C levels &le;7 percent and who have demonstrated that they can use these devices on a nearly daily basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

They measure the glucose content of interstitial fluid (which correlates well with plasma glucose) using an electrochemical enzymatic sensor. Interstitial fluid is accessed by a needle sensor inserted subcutaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Because of reliability issues and the need to calibrate the devices, CGM does not eliminate the need for at least occasional fingersticks.</p><p>In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided a &quot;non-adjunctive&quot; claim to the Dexcom Gen 5 device, allowing patients to make treatment decisions, including insulin dosing, directly from this CGM device without the need for confirmatory fingerstick testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a study using an older version of the Dexcom device, use of CGM without confirmatory SMBG was as safe and effective as using CGM with SMBG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The Gen 5 still requires twice-daily fingerstick testing for calibration, and it should be noted that older Dexcom CGMs and the Enlite CGM do not have the non-adjunctive claim, so fingerstick glucose readings are required both for calibration and as confirmation of glucose levels before making decisions on insulin dosing.</p><p>Another CGM device, the Libre, received a non-adjunctive indication from the FDA in 2017. Fingerstick glucose determinations are not needed for calibration or confirmation of routine blood glucose values. However, fingerstick glucose levels are required to confirm hypoglycemia or impending hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. With this device, which uses flash technology, glucose data are obtained by swiping a reader next to a transmitter worn on the arm. The system does not alarm for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia like other CGM systems.</p><p>With some devices (sometimes referred to as &quot;professional CGM&quot;), the patient receives no information while wearing the device. Results can be determined in a clinician's office and graphed, providing useful information about the frequency of unrecognized hypoglycemia and the extent of within-day and between-day variations in blood glucose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62355\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62355 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Most devices (often referred to as &quot;personal CGM&quot;) now provide the patient with real-time results of glucose values on a continuous basis, which can be automatically and securely shared with a clinician via a mobile medical glucose-monitoring application downloaded on to a mobile device, such as a cell phone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> &ndash; In meta-analyses of trials comparing CGM with SMBG in patients with type 1 diabetes, consistent and reliable use of a CGM system can modestly improve glycemic control (weighted mean difference [WMD] in A1C -0.2 to -0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>].

Patients in the CGM group performed a mean of 2.9 fingersticks daily, compared with 3.8 per day in the control group.

Additionally, monitoring can be very useful to avoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> help treat potentially dangerous hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cases illustrating problems with insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Morning hyperglycemia'</a>.)</p><p>This regimen will be effective only if the patient is able to use the information to make appropriate dietary or therapeutic adjustments. Many glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">meters/CGM</span> systems provide data management features that can be downloaded onto a computer, allowing graphic representation of glycemic variation by time of day or over a period of weeks, allowing calculation of means and visualization of trends and variances. Unless results are reviewed on a frequent basis to detect and address blood glucose patterns, self-monitoring will not fulfill its purpose. Relying on the automatic data storage of the <span class=\"nowrap\">meters/monitors,</span> without regularly reviewing the results, may detract from the clinical utility of monitoring. Pattern recognition may be improved if results are recorded in a diary that includes information on food intake, physical activity, and insulin dosing, which the patient can examine on a regular basis.</p><p>Optimal use of the data obtained is best done in two stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pattern identification</strong> &ndash; Patterns, as opposed to intermittent problems, are best identified if there are a relatively large number of measurements. Thus, blood glucose values should be recorded four to seven times daily for several days and evaluated for patterns of variation, which allow adjustment of doses or types of insulin at different times of the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insulin algorithms</strong> &ndash; Once a basic regimen of eating, exercise, and insulin dosing has been established, there will still be day-to-day variability in blood glucose values due, among other factors, to the vagaries of insulin and food absorption (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). Insulin dosing decisions can be effectively made using an insulin algorithm in which the before-meal dose of short-acting insulin is adjusted according to the blood glucose value and, for patients who use carbohydrate counting, anticipated carbohydrate content of the meal. Changes in exercise can also be included in this calculation. The adjustments should be small in patients who are very sensitive to insulin or who are taking low doses of insulin (as with a subcutaneous, continuous insulin infusion via a pump). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cases illustrating problems with insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Insulin algorithm'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cases illustrating problems with insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Late afternoon hypoglycemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cases illustrating problems with insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Late morning hyperglycemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>If <span class=\"nowrap\">SMBG/CGM</span> is initiated to improve glycemic control, patient education strategies are necessary to ensure successful management of <span class=\"nowrap\">SMBG/CGM</span> feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one small, longitudinal study of patient views on SMBG, the frequency of testing decreased over time, often because patients did not know how to respond to high readings, and patients perceived that providers were more interested in A1C values than glucose logs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In another study, use of SMBG was successful in reducing A1C values when accompanied by training of patients and clinicians to collect and interpret SMBG profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Similarly, CGM is only beneficial if patients understand the technology and use the information to adjust insulin doses. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p>With a well-educated and motivated patient, therapeutic advice can often be given over the telephone or even via fax or e-mail. It is important not to recommend many changes at the same time. Having made a change, it is usually best to wait several days until the effect of that change can be assessed from further blood glucose measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4883080\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4883087\"><span class=\"h2\">Ketonuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for urinary ketones is helpful in patients with type 1 diabetes because any positive value suggests the presence of ketonemia. In some countries, meters are available to measure capillary blood beta-hydroxybutyrate directly. These measurements are replacing the measurement of urinary ketones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In patients with type 1 diabetes, the urine should be tested for ketones if the blood glucose concentration is above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for unexplained reasons, especially if the person feels generally unwell at the time. Testing for ketonuria should also be performed during periods of illness or stress or if there are symptoms compatible with ketoacidosis, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The presence of ketones in the urine does not always mean that the person has impending ketoacidosis. Ketonuria indicates that the person is in a catabolic state and is breaking down fat, and it can occur in anyone who has a negative caloric balance while dieting. However, in type 1 diabetes, the presence of urine ketones along with hyperglycemia is presumptive evidence of a pathologic catabolic state more serious than hyperglycemia alone. Under these circumstances, the person should be advised to retest every two to three hours, take measures to keep well hydrated, and take extra insulin if indicated. Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed separately.

Ideally, testing at home should be done four to seven times daily (before and 90 to 120 minutes after meals, before bedtime, and, occasionally for safety, at 3 AM) to adjust insulin doses for meals and avoid hypoglycemic events. Additionally, it is useful to test blood glucose levels before, during, and after exercise. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Type 1 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar guidelines apply to patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, although their glucose levels are characteristically more stable, and they may require less frequent monitoring. In addition, patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sulfonylureas or meglitinides, which can also cause hypoglycemia, should be tested once to twice per day during titration of their doses but, after a stable dose and glycemic targets are achieved, it may only be necessary to test several times per week, usually in the morning or before dinner. All patients treated with insulin or sulfonylureas need to test more frequently before driving and during long periods of driving, on sick days, and when there are changes in diet and exercise patterns. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SMBG may not be necessary, or less frequent SMBG may be appropriate, for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not taking medications associated with hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Errors in SMBG may result from poor technique, lower test sensitivity in measuring low blood glucose levels, improper storage of test strips, or interfering substances. (See <a href=\"#H2092660720\" class=\"local\">'Potential errors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood is usually sampled from the fingertips. Monitoring from alternate sites, such as the skin of the forearm, may give slightly lower results than those taken at the fingertips since they may sample venous blood rather than capillary blood. While this should not be a problem if the patient uses one or the other site exclusively, the between-test variability will increase if numerous sites (such as fingertips and forearm sites) are used. Alternative sites may also give less reliable results when there are rapid fluctuations in blood sugar. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Site of testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), blood glucose levels are reported to the patient in real time. Consistent and reliable use of a CGM system can modestly improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Some studies have shown fewer periods of hypoglycemia with CGM, but there are concerns with reproducibility of glucose results, particularly in the lower glucose range, with currently available CGM. Because of reliability issues and the need to calibrate most CGM devices, CGM does not eliminate the need for at least occasional fingersticks. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4015626037\" class=\"local\">'CGM systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with type 1 diabetes most likely to benefit from CGM include those who already understand and are highly motivated to use intensive insulin therapy, continue frequent home glucose monitoring using fingersticks, and use the trending information from CGM to make insulin adjustments. CGM also may be appropriate for selected patients with type 2 diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injections, particularly in patients with frequent hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic unawareness. CGM is not recommended for the inpatient or critical care setting. (See <a href=\"#H106161347\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies are currently evaluating the efficacy of a fully automated, closed-loop system of insulin delivery based upon continuous glucose sensing.
