Most patients will have one of three common diagnoses (acute otitis media, otitis externa, or otitis media with effusion) which are generally not serious. The rare cases of more serious disease associated with ear pain usually result from extension of ear infection to adjacent anatomic structures (eg, mastoiditis, meningitis, malignant otitis externa, venous sinus thrombosis). Basilar skull fracture or epidural hematoma after head trauma may also present with ear pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of ear pain can be categorized by the anatomic site from which the pain originates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60554 \">table 1</a>). Patients with primary otalgia have pain originating from the ear itself. Secondary otalgia is referred pain, originating in another anatomic site but causing the sensation of arising from the ear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Auricle</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Contusion (auricular hematoma)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt trauma to the external ear may result in contusions of the auricle. Physical findings may include swelling, ecchymosis, and tenderness overlying the auricle. Lacerations to the ear may also occur. Care should be taken to evaluate for lacerations involving the perichondrium or cartilage itself, which will require a layered repair and present an increased risk of infection.</p><p>Auricular hematomas are localized collections of subperichondrial blood that typically result either from blunt impact or from friction, as commonly occurs during wrestling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Shearing of the perichondrium away from the underlying cartilage results in rupture of the subperichondrial blood vessels. The hematomas are typically found in the anterior superior part of the auricle and present as a fluctuant, purple or red, mildly tender mass. Hematoma drainage followed by careful pressure bandaging of the auricle to prevent reaccumulation of the hematoma is essential to optimal cosmetic outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cellulitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellulitis of the auricle frequently develops after trauma, an insect bite, or an ear piercing. Patients present with fairly rapid onset and progression of pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, and induration. In some cases, the swollen auricle will appear to protrude outward.</p><p>Perichondritis is an infection of the perichondrium, the thin fascial layer surrounding the auricular cartilage. Perichondritis may result from blunt trauma or from piercings. Infection involving the cartilage can lead to permanent deformity of the ear, so perichondritis must be recognized and treated promptly. With perichondritis, the cartilaginous portion of the ear is red, swollen, and tender, but the ear lobe, which contains no cartilage, may be spared. Often, there is a focal area of fluctuance, indicating subperichondrial abscess that requires drainage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the eye, ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system&quot;, section on 'Perichondritis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Herpes zoster oticus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes zoster oticus describes a reactivation of the varicella (chickenpox) virus after prior varicella infection that involves the skin of the external ear. Burning pain, hyperesthesia, and pruritus may precede the onset of vesicular lesions, making early diagnosis a challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Vesicular lesions may be seen on the pinna or in the ear canal. Associated inner ear dysfunction (hearing loss or vertigo) or facial weakness (the Ramsay Hunt syndrome) may occur. This syndrome is rare in young children, especially in the era of universal varicella vaccination, but it may be seen occasionally in adolescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Herpes zoster oticus)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergic angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic swelling of the external ear may result from local allergic reactions to insect bites or from contact dermatitis (as with poison ivy). There is usually prominent pruritus and little if any pain, induration, or tenderness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3561800415\"><span class=\"h3\">Juvenile spring eruption (polymorphous light eruption)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with this form of sun reaction present with bullae, redness, and itch or sometimes pain on the superior aspect of the auricles which is symmetric and bilateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55229%7EDERM%2F68969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55229 graphicRef68969 \">picture 1A-B</a>). There may also be inflamed itchy plaques on the face or dorsal hands. This condition typically presents early in the sunny season of the year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymorphous-light-eruption#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polymorphous light eruption&quot;, section on 'Juvenile spring eruption (PMLE variant)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Environmental injuries to the ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frostbite or sunburn can also cause redness, swelling, and pain of the auricle. Typically, there will be a history of environmental exposure to suggest the diagnosis. Often, there will be bilateral ear involvement, which is atypical of most infections or local allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frostbite#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frostbite&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn#H11503644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sunburn&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear canal</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Otitis externa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otitis externa refers to diffuse infection of the external ear canal, typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or occasionally other gram-negative rods. Otitis externa usually results from the introduction of water into the ear canal as a result of swimming. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-including-swimmers-ear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cardinal symptom of acute otitis externa is pain and tenderness localized to the auditory meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There may also be pain with jaw movement, a feeling of fullness in the ear, itching of the ear canal, or discharge from the canal. Fever is uncommon. On physical examination, most patients will have tenderness of the tragus and pain with otoscopy. The ear canal may appear swollen, red, or macerated. A thick and sometimes malodorous discharge may be present. The tympanic membrane (TM) may appear red, but in cases of isolated otitis externa, there should be no fluid behind the TM.</p><p>Fungal otitis externa (caused by Aspergillus or Candida) can occur, especially if the normal bacterial milieu of the ear canal has been eradicated by extensive use of topical antimicrobial agents. Fungal otitis externa is characterized by itch more than pain. White flaky debris may be seen in the ear canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Otomycosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant otitis externa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant otitis externa occurs when infection spreads from the ear canal to the surrounding bones of the skull base [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This condition is quite rare in pediatrics but may occur in patients with immunocompromise. Patients with malignant otitis externa typically have a more intense and deep-seated ear pain, systemic signs of toxicity or fever, and possibly tenderness of the temporal bone or facial nerve palsy. The diagnosis is suggested by elevated inflammatory markers (ESR or CRP) and confirmed by cranial imaging (CT or MRI) indicating osteomyelitis of the skull base. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the usual pathogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-necrotizing-external-otitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant (necrotizing) external otitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Contact dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of topical antimicrobial or analgesic drops may result in a contact dermatitis of the external ear. A pink-red confluent, slightly bumpy rash may be noted in the ear canal, in the concha, or on the surrounding skin. Itch is more prominent than pain, and discharge is uncommon. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) of the ear canal may cause similar findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contact-dermatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contact dermatitis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Furuncle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Furunculosis is a localized skin infection involving one or more hair follicles of the outer ear canal, typically caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Patients with furunculosis have focal pain and a red, swollen, tender mass in the external canal. There is typically no swelling of the pinna, ear discharge, fever, or adjacent adenopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1368100182\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Skin abscess'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Foreign body</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foreign bodies in the ear canal usually present with a suggestive history, but sometimes ear pain or hearing loss may be the chief complaint. Foreign bodies that have been present for some length of time may be obscured by surrounding cerumen, granulation tissue, or pus, thereby making the diagnosis more challenging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of foreign bodies of the outer ear&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerumen impaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerumen impaction itself is a fairly common cause of ear discomfort, though intense pain is uncommon. Often, patients complain of ear fullness or hearing impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerumen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerumen&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, tumors of the external auditory canal can occur and may present with ear pain. Rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and eosinophilic granuloma have been reported. These cases may involve a granulomatous mass in the external auditory canal and bloody or serosanguineous discharge. Patients that appear to have a relapsing or unremitting case of otitis externa or perforated otitis media should be evaluated for the possibility of a tumor in the ear canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging&quot;, section on 'Head and neck'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Middle and inner ear</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute otitis media (AOM)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AOM remains the most common illness diagnosed by pediatricians. In AOM, ear pain, which at times can be quite severe, is typically felt deep within the ear. Often, the pain is worse when the patient is supine. Nasal congestion and cough typically precede the ear pain by several days. Fever occurs in some cases. In younger patients nonspecific symptoms, such as fussiness or irritability, disturbed sleep, and poor feeding may predominate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>On otoscopic examination, patients with acute otitis media have evidence of middle ear effusion, with a TM that is bulging or has decreased mobility. Bulging of the TM is the most specific sign of AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The TM may appear cloudy or opaque, with a white, yellow, or occasionally green color reflecting pus behind the TM. An air fluid level may be seen, though this is more common with otitis media with effusion. In some cases the TM may have focal bullae. The TM usually also has focal or diffuse areas of redness, injection, or hemorrhage which should be distinguished from the milder pink flush often seen with fever or crying. The external ear examination is typically normal, with no redness or tenderness, and no adjacent lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Myringitis refers to inflammation of the TM, with or without associated middle ear fluid. In cases of isolated myringitis, redness or bullae of the TM may be noted in the absence of apparent fluid in the middle ear. Myringitis may be caused by trauma or infection. Bacterial pathogens are most commonly implicated, but viruses may play a role. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Bullous myringitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications of AOM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Complications and sequelae'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane (TM)</strong> &ndash; Suppurative TM perforation is a common complication of AOM, resulting from the accumulation of pus under pressure in the middle ear. Typically, the patient reports ear pain followed by otorrhea, which may be quite copious. After the TM has ruptured, the patient may experience a relief of pain. On physical examination, a thin, watery, and sometimes foul-smelling fluid is usually observed. In many cases, it may be impossible to visualize the TM. Purulent otorrhea may also be seen in patients who have otitis media in the setting of prior tympanostomy tube placement. In these patients, pathogens may include the typical middle ear bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which presumably migrate inward from the external ear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mastoiditis</strong> &ndash; Mastoiditis occurs when the mastoid air cells, which connect directly to the middle ear space, become infected as a result of adjacent AOM. Clinical findings include pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness over the mastoid region, protrusion of the ear, fever, and toxicity. The diagnosis can be confirmed by CT scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mastoiditis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mastoiditis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facial palsy</strong> &ndash; Dysfunction of cranial nerve VII is a rare complication of AOM, probably resulting from inflammation or stretching of the nerve as it passes through the middle ear space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On physical examination, limited ability to close the ipsilateral eye, limited ability to raise the eyebrows, flattening of the nasolabial fold, and asymmetric smile may be noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=facial-nerve-palsy-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Facial nerve palsy in children&quot;, section on 'Otitis media'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inner ear infection</strong> &ndash; Labyrinthitis or petrositis are also rare complications of AOM, resulting from contiguous spread of infection. Sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo may occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute ataxia&quot;, section on 'Labyrinthitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Involvement of contiguous structures</strong> &ndash; AOM rarely seeds contiguous structures, such as the meninges <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the brain, causing brain, epidural, or subdural abscess or meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fever, headache, meningismus, ill appearance, altered mental status or focal neurologic findings may result. Alternatively, the infection may remain confined to the middle ear, but inflammatory mediators incite a thrombosis of the adjacent sigmoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lateral sinuses (&quot;otitic hydrocephalus&quot;). Diagnosis is confirmed by brain imaging (brain abscess, venous sinus thrombosis) or lumbar puncture (meningitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Otitis media with effusion (OME)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OME refers to fluid in the middle ear space without acute inflammation. Middle ear fluid typically accumulates as a result of Eustachian tube dysfunction, which itself usually results from nasal infection or allergy. Some patients with OME are asymptomatic, but others have mild ear pain. Feelings of ear fullness or decreased hearing are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The hallmark of OME on physical examination is poor or absent mobility of the TM. Bulging of the TM is uncommon and typically indicates an alternative diagnosis of acute otitis media. The TM may be mildly full, in neutral position, or even retracted, indicating negative pressure in the middle ear space. The TM may appear amber and translucent (indicating true serous fluid) or mildly white or yellow and cloudy. Occasionally, the TM may have a blue color. In some cases of clear, colorless effusions, the presence of bubbles (indicating air trapped within the fluid collection) may be the only sign of effusion. Redness of the TM is not expected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesteatoma is a rare but serious complication of chronic OME, in which a benign mass of epithelial tissue develops in or behind the tympanic membrane (TM) and can erode into the bone of the ear canal. Permanent hearing deficits may result. The cholesteatoma may present with ear pain or a sense of ear fullness. Physical examination will reveal the presence of a red or yellow mass typically involving the posterior aspect of the TM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76079\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76079 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55060\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55060 \">picture 3</a>).

In some cases, the perforation will be easily visualized, but in other cases bleeding from the TM may obscure the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-etiology#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Tympanic membrane perforation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Traumatic disruption of the ossicles or inner ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penetrating or blunt trauma may also lead to traumatic disruption of the ossicles, which may be evident on otoscopy or may be suggested by new onset of severe hearing loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-etiology#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a>.) </p><p>Inner ear injury is a rare but serious consequence of barotrauma or blunt trauma. Tinnitus, hearing loss, or vertigo in the setting of trauma should lead the clinician to consider this diagnosis. In some cases, the deficits may be reversible with urgent surgical decompression.

Rarely, profuse epistaxis will cause hemotympanum by reflux of blood from the nares into the middle ear via the eustachian tube. On examination, the TM has a purple or red color and may be full or bulging. If blood accumulates under sufficient pressure in the middle ear, the TM may rupture.

These cases will be distinguished by the absence of findings in the ear itself and by the findings of inflammation or injury to adjacent structures. The referred pain arises from nerves that partially innervate the auricle or external auditory canal and include spinal nerves C2 and C3 and cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Auricular lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preauricular lymph nodes may become enlarged in response to ocular processes (most commonly, conjunctivitis) or parotid disorders (parotitis, or rarely malignancy). Postauricular nodes typically become enlarged in response to conditions involving the external ear, the skin overlying the mastoid region, or Epstein Barr virus infection (infectious mononucleosis). Acutely infected nodes are tender, with overlying redness, and occasionally fluctuance. Benign reactive nodes are typically less tender, with no fluctuance and no overlying redness. Malignancy is rare, but should be considered with very large or especially hard, nontender nodes.

On examination, swelling and tenderness of this region will be evident, occasionally with overlying redness. Because of swelling of the isthmus of the parotid gland, the underlying bony angle of the mandible often cannot be distinctly palpated.</p><p>Most parotid infections in children result from viral infection (eg, mumps, parainfluenza, influenza A, enteroviruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In these patients, parotid swelling is often bilateral. Bacterial parotitis caused by S. aureus is infrequent. This infection presents with high fever accompanied by unilateral parotid swelling with erythema, marked tenderness of the parotid gland, and pus expressed from Stensen's duct with parotid massage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Parotid swelling is common in patients with HIV, but true HIV parotitis is rare.</p><p>Salivary gland stones (sialolithiasis), leading to obstruction to the parotid gland outflow, can also cause parotid swelling and pain, which may refer to the ear.

Careful examination will reveal that the pain emanates from the TMJ, and not from the ear itself. Pain is often exacerbated by full opening of the mouth or by clenching of the teeth. Palpation of the TMJ region may reveal tenderness, or a palpable clicking sensation with joint motion.

Because the facial nerve provides sensation to a region of skin adjacent to the ear, inflammation of the seventh cranial nerve may present with vaguely localized pain in this area. Typically, weakness of the ipsilateral face will be present and will lead to the correct diagnosis.

In older children and adolescents, a larger proportion of cases stem from otitis externa, throat infections, or temporomandibular joint disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blunt or penetrating trauma</strong> &ndash; The timing and mechanism of injury should be elicited. Follow-up questions should determine the presence of altered mental status, headache, nausea, vomiting, focal neurologic complaints, or seizures, all of which may suggest intracranial injury. The clinician should also inquire about bloody or clear otorrhea which may indicate traumatic disruption of the tympanic membrane and an associated basilar skull fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever</strong> &ndash; Fever is common in minor illnesses, such as uncomplicated otitis media and upper respiratory infection with associated otitis media with effusion. However, fever may indicate complications, such as mastoiditis, meningitis, brain abscess, or malignant otitis externa. In cases with fever, the clinician should ask follow-up questions regarding the presence of headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, or severe toxicity which may indicate more serious infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal congestion</strong> &ndash; Most cases of middle ear disease (acute otitis media or OME) follow from preceding nasal allergy, infection, or obstruction. In cases with no history of preceding nasal symptoms, middle ear disease becomes substantially less likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The clinician should inquire about the duration, severity and course of the symptoms. Other questions to distinguish the cause of the nasal symptoms may also be appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ear tenderness</strong> &ndash; Pain with manipulation of the ear, as when pulling a shirt over the head, strongly suggests a diagnosis of external ear disease, such as otitis externa. External ear pain is not typically present in middle ear disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hearing loss</strong> &ndash; Mild to moderate conductive hearing loss may accompany minor illnesses, such as acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, or otitis externa. However, more significant hearing loss may indicate cholesteatoma, traumatic disruption of the ossicles, or inner ear disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ear drainage</strong> &ndash; In the absence of trauma, ear drainage stems either from otitis externa or otitis media with perforation or tympanostomy tubes. Typically, the drainage in otitis externa is scant and thicker in consistency, whereas the drainage from otitis media can be quite copious and may be bloody, serosanguineous, purulent, or thin and watery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Swimming</strong> &ndash; A history of recent swimming makes the diagnosis of otitis externa more likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minor trauma to the ear</strong> &ndash; Bug bites or scratches to the external ear often serve as the nidus for cases of cellulitis. Bug bites also may trigger allergic angioedema of the external ear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Barotrauma</strong> &ndash; Recent air travel or undersea diving are potential causes for hemotympanum in the absence of external trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Environmental exposures</strong> &ndash; Exposure to sun, cold, or contact allergens (like poison ivy) may be pertinent in cases of auricular inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Past medical history</strong> &ndash; History of prior ear infections or tympanostomy tube placement increases the likelihood of acute otitis media. Topical medication use may explain the source of external ear eruption or fungal otitis externa. Patients with immune deficiency or other significant illnesses may have earache as a sign of a serious contiguous disease, such as cerebral abscess or meningitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with abnormal vital signs who present initially with ear pain may be suffering from serious infection, such as meningitis or sepsis, or serious traumatic injury, such as epidural hematoma. Patients with an abnormal mental status in association with ear pain may again be suffering from brain infection or traumatic injury.</p><p>For stable patients, the level of discomfort should be assessed. Children with severe cases of otitis media or externa may be holding their ear and crying. Young infants or toddlers may be fussy and difficult to console.</p><p>If there is any possibility of hearing loss, hearing should be assessed with whispered words for older, cooperative children and with an assessment of sound localization ability in younger children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">External ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external ear should be inspected for signs of traumatic injury, such as lacerations, ecchymoses, fluctuant hematomas, or swelling. If trauma is suspected, the temporal and parietal region of the skull should be assessed for deformity or tenderness indicating possible fracture. Signs of basilar skull fracture, such as periorbital ecchymoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69662\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69662 \">picture 5</a>) or Battle sign (ecchymosis overlying the mastoid bone) should be sought.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Otoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>On otoscopic examination, the examiner should first assess whether the tympanic membrane can be visualized adequately. Whenever possible, cerumen should be removed to permit an unobstructed view of the entire ear canal and tympanic membrane (TM).</p><p>The ear canal should be examined for redness, flaking, swelling, or thick discharge, all of which may be signs of otitis externa. Ear discharge can also be seen with acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; the drainage is usually more copious and watery than with otitis externa. Additional findings may include the presence of masses, foreign bodies, bullae, or eczematous changes.</p><p>If the tympanic membrane appears thickened or cloudy, or if air bubbles are evident behind the TM, a middle ear effusion should be suspected. In acute otitis media, the tympanic membrane may have diffuse redness, injection, or focal areas of hemorrhage, which should be distinguished from the generalized pink, flushed appearance of the TM frequently seen in children who have fever or who have been crying. An opaque white, yellow, or green color to the tympanic membrane, without visualization of any bony landmarks, indicates a purulent effusion and is another common finding in acute otitis media. Occasionally, tense pus-filled bullae may be seen in acute otitis media. Redness or bullae of the TM without evident fluid in the middle ear suggests isolated myringitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other findings'</a>.)</p><p>A TM that bulges laterally towards the examiner indicates that the middle ear is under positive pressure, as with acute otitis media and is the most specific sign of acute otitis media. In contrast, a retracted TM indicates negative pressure in the middle ear space, which is a sign of Eustachian tube dysfunction sometimes seen in cases of otitis media with effusion. Similarly, with pneumatic otoscopy, decreased movement of the TM upon application of positive pressure indicates middle ear fluid under pressure, while decreased movement with negative pressure suggests Eustachian tube dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Otoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Perforations of the tympanic membrane should be noted. If a tympanostomy tube has been inserted, its location and patency should be assessed.</p><p>In cases of trauma, hemotympanum may be noted. Hemotympanum is characterized by a red or purple effusion which may occupy the entire middle ear space or may appear as an air-fluid level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h3\">Sources of secondary otalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) should be assessed for tenderness, mobility, pain with movement, clicking, or crepitus with motion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporomandibular disorders in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The parotid gland should be evaluated for enlargement, focal masses, tenderness, and loss of the normal mandibular angle. Abnormal discharge or redness of Stensen duct in the intraoral examination may also be seen with purulent parotitis.</p><p>The oral mucosa, gingivae, teeth, tonsils, and pharynx should be evaluated for abnormalities that indicate stomatitis, dental abscess, tonsillitis, or pharyngitis, all of which may present with pain referred to the ear.

However, ancillary testing may be appropriate in cases where more serious diagnoses are suspected. Ancillary testing may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) scan of head &ndash; Head CT is indicated in trauma cases if intracranial injury or basilar skull fracture are suspected. CT should also be performed to confirm suspected diagnoses of mastoiditis or malignant otitis externa. Head CT precedes LP if meningitis is suspected but signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal intracranial lesions (ie, brain abscess) may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &ndash; CBC and ESR are often elevated in cases of more serious or deep-seated infections, such as mastoiditis, malignant otitis externa, or bacterial meningitis.

Thus, empiric treatment is usually sufficient and less costly than culture. Cultures are reserved for patients with severe external otitis associated with periauricular cellulitis or fever. Cultures should also be considered in patients who are immunocompromised or who have not responded to treatment within about three days. Most of these patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist. Culture of the purulent material is performed with a very small cotton swab.

Cellulitis causes pain, tenderness, and induration, in contrast to local allergic reactions (as with insect bites or poison ivy) or juvenile spring eruption, which typically cause pruritus but little or no pain and tenderness. Fever is sometimes present with cellulitis but is not a feature of allergic reactions. In some instances the redness and swelling is caused by a retained earring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear#H19482341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of foreign bodies of the outer ear&quot;, section on 'Foreign bodies of the pinna'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rare cases of perichondritis can be distinguished from cellulitis by the sparing of the ear lobe (which has no cartilage) or by the presence of focal subperichondrial abscesses. There is usually a history of antecedent blunt trauma or ear piercing. Children with perichondritis may need incision and drainage and are typically admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the eye, ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system&quot;, section on 'Perichondritis'</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of redness and swelling of the auricle include sunburn and frostbite, which in most cases will be evident from the history and will frequently involve both ears symmetrically. Minor redness of the ear, especially in the concha, may be seen in cases of otitis externa (see below). However, most cases of simple otitis externa do not lead to swelling or diffuse redness of the auricle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frostbite#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frostbite&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn#H11503644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sunburn&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with vesicular lesions in the ear canal and pinna, especially with pruritus or burning discomfort to the region, have herpes zoster oticus. In some cases, the pruritus, pain, or sensory abnormalities may precede the development of visible skin lesions by several days, so clinicians should consider the diagnosis in older children with hyperesthetic ear discomfort and no visible lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Herpes zoster oticus)'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, some patients with apparent abnormality of the auricle may actually be suffering from mastoiditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60379\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60379 \">algorithm 4</a>). In mastoiditis, the inflammation of the mastoid region behind the ear leads the auricle to protrude outward. Typically, however, the tissue of the auricle itself is normal, with no redness, swelling, or tenderness. Examination of the middle ear and the mastoid region will provide additional clues to the diagnosis.

Redness, discharge, or flaking of the ear canal may be seen, but in some mild cases, tragal tenderness may be the only abnormal finding. Patients with a focal area of redness, swelling, and pain in the ear canal likely have furunculosis. Patients with more severe or deep-seated pain, often with fever, and usually with a history of immunocompromise, should be evaluated for the rare diagnosis of malignant otitis externa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-earache-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If malignant otitis externa is suspected, a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CT scan of the head, and otolaryngology consultation are warranted.

Cerumen impaction itself commonly causes hearing loss or a feeling of ear fullness and may occasionally present as ear pain. Thus, removal of cerumen should be pursued whenever possible to aid in diagnosis and sometimes provide therapeutic relief. Foreign bodies, if present, should be removed. If a foreign body cannot be removed, otolaryngology consultation is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerumen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerumen&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear#H19482771\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of foreign bodies of the outer ear&quot;, section on 'Foreign bodies of the external auditory canal (EAC)'</a>.)</p><p>A red or yellow mass in the posterior aspect of the TM may indicate a cholesteatoma, especially if there is an antecedent history of chronic OME. Rarely, cases of malignancy may present similarly. Granulomas of the ear canal may sometimes be an inflammatory reaction to the chronic presence of a foreign body. In other cases, a mass of the wall of the ear canal may indicate a more serious diagnosis, such as eosinophilic granuloma or rhabdomyosarcoma. If the diagnosis is uncertain, otolaryngology consultation is indicated.

Redness, flaking, and scaliness of the ear canal may indicate eczema, especially if the symptoms are chronic or recurring. Contact dermatitis of the ear canal often follows from the use of topical antibiotics or anesthetic drops and may present with a pink-red bumpy rash in the ear canal and on the adjacent skin of the concha. Fungal otitis externa should also be considered, especially if the symptoms have a relatively recent onset and if there is a prior history of topical antibiotic use. In cases of fungal otitis externa, there may be an abnormal odor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discharge in the canal. Culture of the discharge will aid in the diagnosis.

In cases of otitis media associated with facial nerve or inner ear dysfunction, otolaryngology consultation should be pursued to consider possible surgical intervention.

Otorrhea commonly occurs also in patients with tympanostomy tubes and acute otitis media. Occasionally, culture of the fluid may help in guiding antibiotic therapy, although empiric therapy is usually sufficient. Typically, the copious amount and thin consistency of the draining fluid, the absence of tragal tenderness, and a history of preceding nasal symptoms distinguish the otorrhea of otitis media from the discharge sometimes seen in otitis externa.
