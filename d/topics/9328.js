SDH in children differs significantly from SDH in adults because inflicted head injury is a common etiology, especially in pediatric patients under two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast to epidural hematoma (EDH), indications for operative management of SDH are less clear, and surgery is less likely to prevent morbidity and mortality.

Under normal conditions, the subdural region does not exist as a separate layer, unlike the subarachnoid space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major sources of bleeding in patients with SDH: bridging blood vessels that cross the subdural space and cerebral cortical hemorrhage caused by direct brain trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Chronic hematomas in the higher convexities are associated with brain sag as gravity assists the brain separating from the dura. SDH associated with severe head injury is often located along the convexities of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes where tearing of bridging vessels and traumatic impact between the brain and the skull occurs. SDH seen in the interhemispheric space or posterior fossa highly suggests inflicted injury, as do hematomas in multiple sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Subdural and epidural hematoma anatomic comparison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key differences between SDH and epidural hematoma (EDH) are readily demonstrated by unenhanced head CT or by pathologic specimens. EDH, which is located in the potential space between dura and skull, does not cross the tight dural attachments at the cranial sutures. Consequentially, EDH characteristically has a lens-shaped, convex appearance and is limited in scope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79566\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79566 \">image 1</a>). SDH can cross cranial suture margins but is limited by internal dural attachments, such as the falx and tentorium, and therefore typically appears as a crescent-shaped or concave extra-axial lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74235\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74235 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood vessel injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of closed head injury, rotational force can produce injury to veins, arteries, or brain parenchyma, resulting in subdural hematoma (SDH), epidural hematoma (EDH), or coup-countercoup contusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In young children with inflicted head injury, vigorous shaking, with or without a direct blow, causes shearing of white upon gray matter and disruption of bridging vessels caused by violent movement of the brain within the skull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Venous hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute SDH is usually caused by tearing of the bridging veins that drain from the surface of the brain to the dural sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rupture of these vessels allows for bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membranes and dura through which the vessels traverse. Venous bleeding is usually arrested by the rising intracranial pressure or direct compression by the clot itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial rupture can also result in SDH, and this source accounts for approximately 20 to 30 percent of adult SDH cases. Most arterial SDHs arise from injuries to small cortical arteries of &lt;1 mm diameter. In adults, both arterial and venous SDHs have generally similar postmortem characteristics, although SDHs caused by arterial rupture are predominately located in the temporoparietal region, while those caused by bridging vein rupture are predominately frontoparietal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subdural hematoma in adults: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Dural traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure (intracranial hypotension) is another mechanism that can result in SDH. Intracranial hypotension is typically caused by a spontaneous or iatrogenic cerebrospinal fluid leak, as may occur following ventricular peritoneal shunting for hydrocephalus in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As the cerebrospinal fluid pressure decreases, there is a reduction in the buoyancy of the brain, causing traction on the anchoring and supporting structures, including the dura. Traction on bridging veins can cause tearing and rupture of these vessels, while intracranial hypotension itself leads to engorgement of cerebral veins and subsequent leakage of fluid into the subdural space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased intracranial pressure (ICP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with closed sutures, the intracranial compartment is protected by the skull, a rigid structure with a fixed internal volume; the intracranial contents include (by volume) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain parenchyma - 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood - 10 percent</p><p/><p>ICP is a function of the volume and compliance of each component of the intracranial compartment, an interrelationship recognized over 150 years ago and known as the Monro-Kellie doctrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Because the overall volume of the cranial vault cannot change in children with closed sutures, an increase in the volume of one component, or the presence of pathologic components, necessitates the displacement of other structures, an increase in ICP, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/12,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14-17</a>]. With an expanding SDH, CSF, intracranial venous blood, and then brain parenchyma are displaced. If the SDH continues to increase in size, then death due to brain herniation through the foramen magnum ensues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This pathophysiology does not necessarily apply in young children because the sutures of the skull remain open until approximately 18 months of age. As a result, they tend to tolerate an expanding SDH better than older children or adults. There may also be age dependent responses to the SDH with younger brains being somewhat resistant to injury from the hematoma alone, but susceptible to other insults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-epidemiology-anatomy-and-pathophysiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The subdural may be very small on radiographic imaging, but accompanies clinical and radiographic signs of severe diffuse brain injury. In this setting, the expected morbidity and mortality is higher than for patients with SDH and minor head injury, even though the size of the hematoma in children with minor head injury is often larger. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Minor head injury'</a> below.)</p><p>SDH after major trauma typically has a worse prognosis than EDH because of the associated extensive brain damage. Although EDH can cause rapid deterioration if not detected and treated, EDH is typically associated with little to no direct brain injury.

The susceptibility of infants to shaking injury arises from the relatively large size of the head, the weakness of the cervical musculature, softness of the skull, and high water content of the brain caused by incomplete myelination. The role of a direct blow as a major cause of injury in shaken babies is controversial. Associated injuries include retinal hemorrhage and fractures of the skull and skeleton.
