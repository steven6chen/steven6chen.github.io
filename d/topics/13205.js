This can happen anywhere food is served, including restaurants and bakeries. Peanut butter is sometimes used as a thickener in chili and sauces. Seed and legume flours are used in baked goods and pastas.

Legislation was enacted in the United States mandating that the ingredients labels on food packages clearly identify the presence of eight specified allergenic foods, including peanut, tree nuts, egg, milk, wheat, soybeans, fish, and crustacean shellfish. However, seeds such as sesame were not included. Other countries are addressing issues of food labeling as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Food labeling'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advisory labeling &ndash; Some products in the United States may have advisory labeling, such as &quot;may contain peanut.&quot; The most commonly labeled items include chocolate candy, cookies, and baking mixes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This type of labeling is not regulated. The risk of allergic reactions to these products is not known, but contamination with clinically significant amounts of peanut allergen was found in a small proportion of products with peanut advisory labeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some individuals with peanut allergy react to minute amounts of peanut allergen, and these reactions can be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. However, it is rare for a patient to know what <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> threshold dose is for triggering a reaction, and it may vary when the individual has a viral infection, participates in aerobic activities, or is taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Thus, we recommend that patients with peanut, tree nut, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seed allergy avoid all products with advisory labeling for these foods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Advisory labeling'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Threshold dose'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately one-third of patients with peanut allergy react to tree nuts. Therefore, unless they are ingesting certain tree nuts, it is important to rule out possible tree nut allergies before allowing these patients to ingest tree nuts. We often recommend that young patients with peanut allergy avoid all tree nuts primarily for safety reasons. Younger children are more likely to be confused about the identification of various nuts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and do not understand all of the issues related to contamination and cross-contact. Once they are old enough to understand these issues, we allow patients who do not have tree nut allergies to eat tree nuts that they can visualize, and therefore identify, or that are contained in commercial labeled foods. We discourage the ingestion of nuts in products from bakeries or restaurants since peanuts are not uncommonly <span class=\"nowrap\">added/substituted</span> for tree nuts. We recommend that children just eat the &quot;allowed&quot; nuts when with their family and continue to avoid peanut and all tree nuts at <span class=\"nowrap\">school/camp</span> to avoid issues with cross-contact, confusion regarding which nuts to avoid, and misidentification.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexpected and nonfood sources &ndash; Skin preparations and hair products may have ingredients derived from peanut, tree nuts, or seeds. Some medications, such as a few metered-dose inhalers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, contain soy lecithin. Soy lecithin is derived from highly processed soy oil and has very little, if any, soy protein. It can be consumed safely by nearly all patients with soy allergy. Thus, these medications are unlikely to be unsafe in patients with peanut allergy, and, therefore, we do not tell patients with peanut allergy to avoid these medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Food allergens in nonfood items'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peanut, tree nuts, and seeds are not essential components of the diet for most people. However, these foods are found in many products. The most straightforward approach in managing any food allergy is <strong>complete</strong> avoidance of the culprit food and all similar foods. This strategy would be logically expected to minimize the chances of accidental exposure to the culprit food through cross-contact.</p><p>However, there may be disadvantages to the strategy of avoiding all similar foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is some evidence, for example, that removing foods from the diet can increase the risk of becoming allergic to them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Possible reasons for the heightened sensitivity include both lack of exposure through ingestion and the opposite explanation, namely, ongoing low-level exposure (through hidden sources or cross-contact). In addition, there may be nutritional, social, or cultural reasons that patients may wish to add certain foods to the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, the clinician's recommendations must carefully balance the patient's preferences with what is known about crossreactivity among these foods if a patient with an allergy to peanut or a certain tree nut or seed wishes to continue eating other forms of nuts or seeds. The severity of the patient's reaction, age of the patient, and nutritional needs also influence the decision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Allergies to other foods'</a>.)</p><p>The following scenarios illustrate some of the issues involved and our management approach. Individual clinicians may decide to adopt different strategies depending upon their level of expertise and the resources available (eg, ability to perform oral food challenges).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have experienced life-threatening anaphylaxis to peanut or a specific tree nut or seed, we recommend avoidance of that specific food and also suggest avoidance of all common <strong>clinically</strong> cross-reactive foods. Peanut and tree nuts are often processed in the same facilities, and therefore there is a risk of accidental exposure due to cross-contact. Furthermore, young patients with an allergy to peanut are at high risk for developing an allergy to tree nuts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Allergies to other foods'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Specifically, we recommend that patients with severe peanut allergy avoid tree nuts and cross-reactive legumes until an evaluation is performed and it is clearly determined that they can tolerate these foods. In younger children with severe peanut allergy, one option is to advise avoidance of lupine and all tree nuts, in addition to peanut, even if testing is negative. In older children and adults, we allow them to eat tree nuts and lupine if they wish <strong>and</strong> if we have determined that they are not reactive (ie, a negative test is sufficient if there is no reaction history, otherwise we perform a food challenge to confirm lack of reactivity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We counsel these patients about the potential increased risk of cross-contact with this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest avoidance of all tree nuts for patients with a severe tree nut allergy. These patients may continue to eat peanut <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specific tree nuts if they are already in their diet. If peanut is not already in their diet, it may be introduced if testing is negative. We counsel them about the precautions discussed above if they choose to eat peanut <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specific tree nuts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We are more flexible in our approach for patients with non-life-threatening reactions to peanut, tree nuts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seeds. We do not discourage patients from avoiding peanut and all tree nuts if that is what they prefer to do. However, a careful evaluation must be performed to determine which cross-reacting foods that a patient has not eaten in the past may be safely consumed if a patient wishes to include some of these foods in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> diet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, a patient who develops an allergy to a tree nut that is moderate in severity and has been avoiding peanut and all tree nuts may ask about the safety of eating peanut, which had not been a regular component of the patient's diet before the reaction. In this case, we would first perform skin testing with a commercial peanut extract. If negative, we would allow the ingestion of peanut because the experience at the author's institution suggests the negative predictive value of skin-prick testing for peanut is generally high. If the skin test was positive to peanut, we would evaluate the level of peanut-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood. If the level was &lt;15 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> and the patient had an interest in eating peanut, we would perform a graded challenge to determine whether there was true clinical reactivity (because false-positive skin tests are not uncommon, and patients may have low levels of allergen-specific IgE without developing clinical symptoms). An oral food challenge with peanut would also be performed if there was any clinical suspicion of peanut allergy or if the clinician was uncomfortable proceeding without additional evaluation. The same process can be undertaken if a patient has an interest in including specific tree nuts in the diet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is typically easier to liberalize the diet to allow peanut, compared with allowing some tree nuts, in people with a tree nut allergy. One can purchase commercial-grade peanut butter that is not contaminated with tree nuts, but it is more complicated to find tree nut-containing products without cross-contact risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We allow people to continue to eat nuts or seeds that have not caused symptoms in the recent past and which they have eaten regularly (similar to having just passed an oral food challenge), if they wish to do so. As an example, a patient with a newly diagnosed allergy to cashew who continued to eat peanut and almond without incident after the reaction to cashew can continue to eat peanut, other tree nuts (except pistachio, in this case, since crossreactivity is higher), and seeds. We discuss with the patient that by keeping peanut and almond in the diet, there is some increased risk of accidental exposure to cashew due to cross-contact. In addition, we discuss the rare possibility of developing additional tree nut allergies over time if the patient is a young child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient sometimes presents with a positive test to a food, such as peanut, that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is currently eating on a regular basis. We do not advise removal of the food from the diet in this case. However, we do discuss with the patient that, on rare occasions, individuals may convert from sensitization to clinical reactivity. In most cases in which this occurs, peanut has been removed from the diet because of a &quot;positive&quot; test result despite no history of clinical reactivity, and clinical symptoms develop when peanut is reintroduced into the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another common scenario is the patient who was tested for food allergies because of a history of other food allergies, atopic disease, or family history and tested positive to a food such as peanut but has never ingested the food. In two studies, one-half of a group of atopic, peanut-na&iuml;ve children who had a skin test reaction to peanut of &ge;3 mm or peanut-specific IgE &ge;0.35 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> reacted to peanut when challenged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In this situation, we take into consideration the size of the skin prick test reaction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the level of specific IgE, the age of the patient, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preferences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We generally advise avoidance of the food if the patient is less than five years of age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the test is strongly &quot;positive.&quot; This age cutoff is for practical, not immunologic, reasons. There is no need to eat peanut. These children often have sensitization to other foods that are more essential to the diet and need to be dealt with first. In addition, clarifying whether or not the child is allergic to peanut is more important once <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> reaches school age. Finally, the older child is better able to cooperate with a challenge and communicate the development of subjective symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We would challenge a child &lt;5 years of age if the parent wanted the child to eat peanut products, the skin prick test reaction was &lt;8 mm, and the peanut-specific IgE &lt;2 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span>. We are more likely to consider an oral food challenge to determine presence or absence of clinical reactivity in the older patient or the individual with more equivocal test results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic pitfalls'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally do not restrict other legumes from the diet in patients with peanut allergy, with the exception of lupine, since it appears to have greater clinical crossreactivity with peanut. Most children have already eaten and tolerated various legumes (eg, soy, pea, string bean, etc) prior to their initial peanut reaction. We typically advise patients that they may continue to eat the tolerated legumes and introduce others into the diet without additional testing. Of note, there is a high rate of false-positive tests to legumes in patients with peanut allergy, making screening tests unreliable. However, we will often test patients who are highly allergic to peanut to other legumes that have greater clinical crossreactivity with peanut (eg, chickpea and lentil) by performing skin tests and sometimes serum IgE tests if they have not already shown tolerance to at least several legumes or if there are concerns of reactions to some legumes. Introduction of additional legumes may require clinician-supervised oral food challenges, depending upon these results and the degree of clinical concern.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE IgE-MEDIATED REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of individuals with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy is important because these patients are at risk for severe reactions. The majority of allergic reactions to peanut, tree nuts, or seeds are systemic. These foods are also among the more common causes of food-induced anaphylaxis, particularly fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fatal-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fatal anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features#H3823067045\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Types of reactions'</a>.)</p><p>The severity of symptoms in a given individual with peanut, tree nut, or seed allergy may vary considerably between reactions. In addition, the severity of an initial reaction does not predict the severity of subsequent reactions. Furthermore, skin test and specific IgE results are not predictive of the severity of reactivity to a food. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Members of a United States-based registry of individuals with peanut <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tree nut allergy reported that subsequent reactions due to accidental ingestion were commonly more severe than their initial reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An Australian study of peanut allergy found that 30 percent of patients who had experienced anaphylaxis had preceding milder reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small study of children with peanut allergy in Singapore, one-half of those who had an accidental exposure had a reaction of greater severity than their initial reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children whose only apparent clinical manifestation of food allergy is atopic dermatitis are at risk of an acute systemic reaction upon reintroduction of that food after an elimination diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p/><p>Accordingly, we suggest that individuals diagnosed with IgE-mediated peanut, tree nut, or seed allergy have an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector(s) available at all times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Thus, we recommend that siblings with atopic symptoms be evaluated before peanut is introduced into their diet. We typically evaluate the sibling of a child with peanut allergy with skin prick tests and, if positive, obtain a peanut-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level to help determine the likelihood that the child will react to peanut. There are no data on the risk to siblings of children with tree nut or seed allergy. We often use skin prick tests to evaluate younger siblings of children who have experienced severe reactions to tree nuts or seeds.
