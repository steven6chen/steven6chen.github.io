Another term for acid reflux is &quot;gastroesophageal reflux disease,&quot; or GERD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21944590\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acid reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the chest, known as heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the throat or an acid taste in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach or chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a raspy voice or a sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained cough</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21944597\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to improve my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You might feel better if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight (if you are overweight)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the head of your bed by 6 to 8 inches (for example, by putting blocks of wood or rubber under 2 legs of the bed or a Styrofoam wedge under the mattress)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid foods that make your symptoms worse (examples include coffee, chocolate, alcohol, peppermint, and fatty foods)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on the amount of alcohol you drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid lying down for 3 hours after a meal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21944604\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments can help with my acid reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few main types of medicines that can help with the symptoms of acid reflux: antacids, surface acting agents, histamine blockers, and proton pump inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78918 \">table 1</a>). All of these medicines work by reducing or blocking stomach acid. But they each do that in a different way.</p><p>Antacids and surface acting agents can relieve mild symptoms, but they work only for a short time. Histamine blockers are stronger and last longer than antacids and surface acting agents. You can buy antacids and most histamine blockers without a prescription.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors are the most effective medicines in treating GERD. Some of these medicines are sold without a prescription. But there are other versions that your doctor or nurse can prescribe.</p><p>Sometimes acid reflux medicines are less expensive if you get them with a prescription. Other times nonprescription medicines are less expensive. If cost is a concern for you, ask your pharmacist how you might reduce the cost of your medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21944611\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse about my acid reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people can manage their acid reflux on their own by changing their habits or taking nonprescription medicines. But you should see a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms are severe or last a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot seem to control your symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had symptoms for many years</p><p/><p>You should also see a doctor or nurse <strong>right away</strong> if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble swallowing, or feel as though food gets &quot;stuck&quot; on the way down</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight when you are not trying to</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choke when you eat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit blood or have bowel movements that are red, black, or look like tar</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21944618\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child or teenager has acid reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child or teenager has acid reflux, take him or her to see a doctor or nurse. Do not give your child medicines to treat acid reflux without talking to a doctor or nurse.</p><p>In children, acid reflux can be caused by a number of problems. It's important to have a doctor or nurse check for these problems before trying any treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21944625\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) during pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Barrett's esophagus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
