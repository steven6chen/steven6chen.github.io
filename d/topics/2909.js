CRT can be achieved with a device designed only for pacing (CRT-P) or with the added capability for defibrillation (CRT-D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F116571\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116571 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The rationale for CRT is that ventricular dyssynchrony can further impair the function of a failing ventricle. Resynchronization may improve performance and reverse the deleterious process of adverse ventricular remodeling, improve quality of life, reduce heart failure hospitalizations, and improve survival outcomes. CRT does not obviate medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications#H1748463281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;, section on 'Rationale for CRT'</a>.) </p><p>The implantation technique for CRT and initial programming considerations will be reviewed here. Indications for CRT and outcomes of CRT in patients in sinus rhythm or with atrial fibrillation and cardiac pacing in patients with heart failure are discussed separately.

Compatibility of the connector pins of all pacing leads into the device header across manufacturers is facilitated by the International Standardization Organization, whereby connections for bipolar and unipolar leads (IS-1), quadripolar leads (IS-4), and defibrillation leads (DF-4) are uniform and interchangeable. Thus, lead and generator technology can be freely mixed among vendors, including epicardial and transvenous leads.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950141512\"><span class=\"h2\">Right atrial lead</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An atrial lead allows sensing and tracking of sinus rhythm to synchronize ventricular activation to follow either a spontaneously occurring sinus beat or a pacemaker-delivered atrial beat. </p><p>Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation or flutter are typically implanted without an atrial lead given the absence of functional atrial contraction. CRT in patients with atrial fibrillation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2026446702\"><span class=\"h2\">Right ventricular lead</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RV lead is an essential component for biventricular pacing systems. Most RV leads are placed transvenously. The transvenous RV lead is typically secured with either a helix or tined mechanism into the RV apex, apical septum, mid septum, or outflow tract. Para-Hisian pacing is an emerging alternative to CRT and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Nonpharmacologic therapy&quot;, section on 'Para-Hisian pacing'</a>.)</p><p>Epicardial RV lead placement is generally performed only in patients with access problems (eg, venous thrombosis) and in patients requiring concomitant cardiac surgery (eg, coronary artery bypass grafting) with which LV epicardial lead placement can be easily combined. When an epicardial approach is selected, the lead is typically secured anteriorly to the right of the interventricular groove. (See <a href=\"#H726334478\" class=\"local\">'Surgical LV epicardial lead placement'</a> below.)</p><p>A key role of the RV lead is sensing intrinsic rhythm, as measured by the bipolar or unipolar R wave amplitude measured in millivolts. Such sensing is useful to inhibit pacing during ventricular arrhythmias and for tachyarrhythmia therapies (ie, shocks or antitachycardia pacing) in the case of a CRT-D system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Overview of indications, components, and functions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the majority of implanted CRT systems, the RV lead paces. As discussed below, the RV lead can be programmed to deliver pacing that is either offset from or simultaneous with LV stimulation. For some innovative CRT methods (eg, adaptive CRT or true LV only CRT), pacing can be entirely deferred. (See <a href=\"#H2933615476\" class=\"local\">'Initial programming considerations'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385993970\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular lead</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All CRT candidates have evidence of native or paced electrical dyssynchrony, usually due to electrical delay or block in the left-sided His-Purkinje conduction system. Outcomes and treatment effects following CRT are best in patients with true left bundle branch block. Pacing stimulation delivered from the LV lead is therefore essential to compensate for the delayed LV activation in order to restore electrical and mechanical synchrony of the ventricular contractions. While CRT pacing can be accomplished using LV leads with unipolar, bipolar, or quadripolar electrodes placed transvenously or with unipolar or bipolar electrodes placed epicardially, contemporary implantations are now most commonly performed transvenously using leads with quadripolar electrodes. These quadripolar leads give the implanting and treating physician more pacing vectors to pace the ventricle and therefore more options for tailoring therapy and avoiding potential complications (eg, phrenic <span class=\"nowrap\">nerve/diaphragmatic</span> capture) (see <a href=\"#H842746341\" class=\"local\">'Multi-site pacing'</a> below). The final pacing configuration is chosen based on the absence of phrenic nerve stimulation near the programmed output, favorable electrical parameters to minimize battery depletion (ie, pacing threshold, impedance), and desired electrical findings (ie, Q-LV, paced QRS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3525880539\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRT can be initiated via a de novo implant or as an upgrade from an existing single or dual chamber system. General criteria for placement of cardiac implantable electronic devices apply, including identification of candidacy for moderate sedation and absence of contraindications to device implantation (such as active bloodstream infection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthetic-considerations-for-electrophysiology-interventional-cardiology-and-transesophageal-echocardiography-procedures#H1116872180\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthetic considerations for electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, and transesophageal echocardiography procedures&quot;, section on 'Procedures for cardiac implantable electronic devices'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H817462787\"><span class=\"h2\">De novo implantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most de novo CRT implantations are performed via a transvenous approach. A pocket for the device is surgically created within the plane of prepectoral fascia 2 to 3 cm below the clavicle. The leads are extended via venous access obtained in either the axillary, subclavian, or cephalic veins and anchored to the pectoral muscle with nonabsorbable suture to tie down sleeves. </p><p>Left ventricular (LV) lead implantation via the coronary sinus (CS) requires cannulation with a sheath or catheter, and should be performed by experienced operators. Cannulation tools include specially designed curved long-sheaths, and in cases of difficult access deflectable catheters with bipolar electrodes to identify the characteristic electrogram of the CS ostium involving approximately equally sized atrial and ventricular components. Some operators employ contrast injections, while others use only fluoroscopic landmarks. Soft-tipped guidewires and subselecting catheters can also be used to both engage the ostium in addition to the targeting specific LV venous branches of interest. Anatomic and functional barriers to CS cannulation include an eccentric ostium due to anatomic variation, or a consequence of right atrial dilatation. Other barriers include the presence of venous valves (Thebesian valve, Valve of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieussens_valve_of_the_coronary_sinus&amp;token=9qJe7OIbS4Q74fx3+nwqPcvtNGTw7pjpXFO1jxMJKQKiHkSyngKvctQll9EEzswG84fUjNKw7SzT/txrwKKBXZRvn3k+v6tQeuS3lA9dL1k=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3500\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Vieussens</a>) or coronary sinus strictures. </p><p>In a contemporary study of de novo transvenous CRT implants among 2014 patients from 114 centers, the overall success rate was 97.1 percent using a median 17 minutes of fluoroscopy, 25 cc of contrast dye, and an a 2.6 percent adverse event rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These outcomes are better than those reported by a similarly sized study approximately 10 years earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], suggesting that technical procedural advancements (ie, cannulation tools, CS venoplasty, quadripolar LV pacing leads), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> operator experience have increased success rates while reducing complications.</p><p>Surgical LV epicardial lead placement is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H726334478\" class=\"local\">'Surgical LV epicardial lead placement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794408601\"><span class=\"h2\">Upgrade from a pre-existing pacing system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRT upgrade from a single or dual chamber transvenous device involves adding an LV pacing lead. The additional lead is most commonly placed transvenously. However, approximately 5 to 10 percent of leads cannot be implanted transvenously via the coronary sinus. Therefore, a small minority of patients require surgical epicardial LV lead placement. Upgrade to a CRT system is appropriate for the patient with a pre-existing pacemaker who develops heart failure with electrical disease substrate that meets criteria for CRT (eg, left bundle branch block). This includes patients with progressive cardiomyopathy induced by a high percentage of right ventricular pacing (pacing-induced cardiomyopathy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of CRT upgrade should be weighed against the procedural risk and complexity of adding a lead, particularly in the presence of venous occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the REPLACE registry, the complication rates for procedures involving lead additions were greater than those for generator replacement alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Factors to consider when deciding whether to proceed with CRT upgrade and in choosing an approach for upgrade include the patient&rsquo;s age, comorbidities, presence of venous occlusive disease, accessibility to an experienced lead extraction center, and accessibility to an experienced cardiac surgery center.</p><p>Contrast venography is recommended prior to creating incisional access for any CRT upgrade procedure. The presence of venous occlusive disease complicates the addition of an ipsilateral transvenous LV lead. Venous occlusive disease (predominantly axillary or subclavian occlusion) occurs in 10 to 30 percent of patients with implantable pacing devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Established risk factors for venous occlusive disease include the number of leads traversing the vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and the presence of larger diameter implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads, particularly those with superior vena cava (SVC) shocking coils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, since less than 10 percent of patients with venous occlusive disease are symptomatic or have physical exam findings such as asymmetric peripheral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], venography is recommended prior to creating incisional access for CRT upgrade procedures.</p><p>Approaches to CRT upgrade in the presence of venous occlusive disease include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One common approach is transvenous extraction of one of the pre-existing leads to allow guidewire-retained access for replacement, plus the addition of a new LV lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the LEXICON study of 2405 extracted leads, the indication of venous occlusion represented 4.5 percent of the total [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the total study population, clinically successful lead extraction was accomplished in 97.7 percent and the major adverse event rate was 1.4 percent, including procedural death in 0.28 percent.

Concerns include risk for skin erosion over bony sternal or clavicular prominences where there is typically minimal subcutaneous tissue, and creating long-term lead management problems in the event of a need for subsequent transvenous extraction. For these reasons, this approach also seems to be less commonly utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726334478\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical LV epicardial lead placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epicardial lead placement entails an increased risk of adverse events and provides no greater benefit compared with transvenous placement, so it is generally regarded as a second-line option in patients who have had unsuccessful transvenous placement or have venous occlusive disease. The exception is for patients requiring concomitant cardiac surgery (ie, valve surgery or coronary artery bypass grafting) with which LV epicardial lead placement can be easily combined. In a series of 42 patients with dedicated &quot;stand alone&quot; LV epicardial lead placement, the mean length of stay was 3.4 days and 30-day adverse event rate was 17.5 percent, including 4.8 percent mortality, 7.5 percent LV lead noncapture, and 5 percent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A study comparing the clinical outcomes of 96 patients with surgically placed epicardial LV leads to transvenous implants found no difference over a mean five years of follow-up in which the overall clinical response rate to CRT pacing was 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The earliest CRT systems involved surgically placed epicardial leads via sternotomy or full thoracotomy approach. Contemporary techniques for dedicated epicardial LV lead placement include a mini-thoracotomy approach involving 3 to 5 cm incisional access in the fourth or fifth intercostal space just anterior to the mid axillary line and single lung ventilation to allow dissection into the pericardial space for implantation of active fixation LV leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A key advantage of surgical epicardial lead placement is that lead placement is not confined to the anatomic branches of the LV venous circulation as is the case with transvenous placement. The lead is fixed directly to the cardiac tissue using a specifically designed instrument, and electrically tested in the same manner as transvenously placed leads. Surgical leads are connected to the pacing device using an IS-1 connector in the case of a bipolar, or a Y-adapter lead extender allowing two unipolar leads to be configured to an IS-1 connector. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1042327573\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT VENTRICULAR LEAD POSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimum left ventricular (LV) lead location paces viable myocardium (ie, avoids scar) from the site of greatest electrical and mechanical delay while avoiding phrenic nerve stimulation.</p><p>The available evidence suggests that the optimal position for the LV lead is generally lateral or posterolateral. Because the posterolateral wall is often the latest segment to contract in a dyssynchronous LV in the presence of left bundle branch block, it is generally the targeted location.</p><p>Transvenous passage of the lead via the coronary sinus into a coronary vein constrains lead location to available branches. Classic LV venous anatomy features an anterior vein coursing in the interventricular groove, an anterolateral branch coursing diagonally from LV apex to base, a midlateral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterolateral vein that often shares a common trunk, and the middle cardiac vein coursing posteriorly to the apex. The lateral and posterolateral branches usually represent the optimal targets for LV pacing leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F116573\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116573 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>A key advantage of surgical epicardial lead placement is that lead placement is not confined to the anatomic branches of the LV venous circulation as is the case with transvenous placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3568596991\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of greatest electrical delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeting the site of greatest LV electrical delay for pacing stimulation to optimize electrical resynchronization has been associated with favorable CRT outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>], and is therefore recommended. Quantitatively, the site of LV activation can be measured from the onset of the Q wave recorded on the surface electrocardiograph to the timing of the local LV electrogram (Q-LV). At the time of implant, operators have an opportunity to measure this interval (in milliseconds) as one of the potential parameters to consider in selecting the site for LV pacing stimulation.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the importance of LV electrical delay as measured by Q-LV as a predictor of improvement in hemodynamic improvement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In separate prospective acute hemodynamic studies of 31 and 32 patients undergoing CRT implant, Q-LV was strongly associated with hemodynamic improvement as measured by <span class=\"nowrap\">dP/dt</span> max independent of the pacing mode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 156 patients, Q-LV was the only independent predictor of improvement in LV ejection fraction and decrease in LV end systolic volume in follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In analysis of the SMART AV trial involving 426 patients, Q-LV was associated with greater improvement in mitral regurgitation, suggesting an additional physiologic mechanism for targeting the site of greatest electrical delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2353293631\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of greatest mechanical delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some experts consider the site of greatest mechanical delay as a factor ancillary to the site of greatest electrical delay when identifying the site for LV pacing.

(This contrasts with the strategy for standard pacemakers, for which the AV interval is often extended beyond 200 ms to promote native AV conduction.) In a post-hoc analysis of the MADIT CRT study involving 1235 patients, sensed AV delays less than 120 ms demonstrated overall better clinical outcomes when compared with longer sensed AV delays, likely attributable to a greater percentage of biventricular pacing in place of intrinsic activation via the native diseased His-Purkinje system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>In patients who fail to experience improvement in symptoms or cardiac function following CRT implantation, postprocedural adjustment in the AV delay (&quot;AV optimization&quot;) performed in conjunction with Doppler echocardiographic assessment may be helpful as a means of improving LV systolic function and reducing presystolic mitral regurgitation. The AV delay can be programmed so that the end of atrial contraction (marked by the end of the A wave) is timed to coincide with the onset of ventricular contraction (marked by the onset of systolic mitral regurgitant flow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Pacing vectors are often adjusted until the narrowest QRS duration is achieved. In general, pacing vectors are avoided if they result in wider QRS morphologies (less electrical synchrony), morphologies similar to left bundle branch block (delayed LV activation), or an apical QRS morphology (less basal pacing). The paced QRS duration and morphology at the time of implant must be judged in the context of anatomic lead location and LV substrate. Maximizing electrical resynchronization using the surface QRS duration as a surrogate marker is beneficial in many instances (as discussed in the fusion pacing section below). However, achievement of a narrow QRS does not always translate into improved mechanical synchrony. Intrinsic ventricular scar patterns can create &quot;balanced delay&quot; in which the overall right and left ventricular activation are relatively simultaneous (ie, paced QRS appears narrow) but remain mechanically dyssynchronous due to nonhomogenous conduction through and around intrinsic LV scar.</p><p>Mismatch between electrical resynchronization and mechanical resynchronization likely explains why an CRT implant strategy focused on achieving the shortest possible paced QRS duration has yielded mixed echocardiographic and clinical results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with little or no intrinsic conduction (ie, complete heart block), achieving a more narrowly paced QRS duration was associated with reduction of LV end-systolic volume of &ge;15 percent from baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a substudy of the PROSPECT trial, greater shortening of the paced QRS over the intrinsic QRS duration was also associated with significantly increased likelihood of clinical and echocardiographic response (odds ratio [OR] 0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of the MADIT CRT trial, shortened paced QRS duration was not qualitatively associated with better outcomes, while apical pacing demonstrated worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p>An apical pacing morphology is always to be avoided and typically characterized by a left bundle branch block appearance in V1 with a superior axis that is negative in limbs leads II, III, and aVF with a widened QRS &gt;200 ms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412896521\"><span class=\"h3\">Optimizing mechanical synchrony</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some experts favor adjusting the timing between the right and left ventricular pacing stimulus (VV timing) to favor earlier (eg, by 20 to 50 ms) right or left ventricular activation with the degree of interventricular synchrony assessed by echocardiography. Among patients who undergo VV optimization, cardiac performance is generally optimal when the LV pacing impulse is pre-excited relative to the RV impulse. While VV optimization is often performed in nonresponders to CRT therapy, the evidence for its use is mixed. It remains an area of continued investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119499091\"><span class=\"h2\">Emerging techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2472539431\"><span class=\"h3\">Fusion pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some experts test the application of a fusion pacing algorithm at the time of implant for patients demonstrating intrinsic AV nodal conduction, and who have a device with an applicable algorithm. For patients with intrinsic left bundle branch block and normal AV conduction, CRT can be achieved by fusion pacing as an alternative to biventricular pacing; the concept is to create fusion between intrinsic conduction occurring antegrade over the intact right bundle and LV pacing ipsilateral to the left bundle branch block. Fusion pacing entails timing the delivery of the LV pacing impulse such that the intrinsic RV activation is &quot;fused&quot; with the paced LV activation. The required delay is evaluated by measuring the time interval for intrinsic conduction from the right atrial lead to the RV lead. </p><p>Thus, fusion pacing should not be equated with &quot;LV only&quot; CRT pacing at largely shortened AV intervals without incorporation of sensed atrial-RV conduction time interval. Indeed, early randomized trials including PATH-CHF and DECREASE-HF, B-LEFT HF, and GREATER EARTH yielded similar outcomes when comparing LV only pacing in patients with left bundle branch block with biventricular pacing at shortened AV intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>]. </p><p>Novel proprietary algorithms have emerged to synchronize ventricular contraction by delaying the timing of LV pacing stimulation to synchronize with intrinsic RV conduction by measuring the sensed atrial-RV conduction timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Vendor-specific fusion pacing algorithms either forgo or delay RV pacing all together while extending the AV delay to promote intrinsic conduction down the native right bundle, and perhaps even proximal branches of the left bundle. Ventricular activation associated with the native His-Purkinje system is faster than paced ventricular activation wave fronts spreading centrifugally from the stimulus. Thus, fusion-pacing algorithms commonly result in a more narrowly paced QRS than either traditional biventricular pacing or LV only pacing as utilizing an intact right bundle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> septal His-Purkinje allows more rapid electrical depolarization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F116574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116574 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In the Adaptive CRT trial, 478 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to fusion pacing (LV only pacing synchronized to RV contraction using the proprietary algorithm) versus standard CRT with echocardiographic-guided optimization.
