The pathophysiology of these disorders and the diagnosis and treatment of hibernating myocardium are discussed separately.

In comparison, hibernating myocardium occurs in the clinical syndromes of unstable and chronic stable angina, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or heart failure (HF). Stunned myocardium and hibernating myocardium may coexist in some patients. Research also suggests that hibernating myocardium may occur from repetitive episodes of stunning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Stable angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support for the role of stunned or hibernating myocardium in stable angina comes from several observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with coronary artery disease and chronic stable angina, prolonged, but reversible LV dysfunction (stunning) occurred after a symptom-limited <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusion despite normal myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The degree of stunning was related to the severity of the coronary stenosis and the reduction in peak myocardial blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV dysfunction at rest in some patients with chronic stable angina improves after revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. In one angioplasty study, for example, 59 of 81 (73 percent) hypokinetic or akinetic segments improved after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. With multivariate analysis, the best predictor of improvement in resting LV ejection fraction (LVEF) after CABG was the number of viable, asynergic myocardial segments per patient demonstrated on a resting thallium perfusion scan, that is, the number of segments that were hibernating; there was no correlation with the degree of angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Recovery may also be related to the degree of ischemia. One study using quantitative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> imaging after exercise and with redistribution, showed that improvement was more likely in regions with persistent defects with a 25 to 50 percent reduction in thallium uptake compared to regions with persistent defects in which thallium uptake was reduced by &gt;50 percent (59 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The reinjection of a second smaller dose of thallium immediately following the redistribution images improves the detection of stress defect reversibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This method can identify viable territories in as many as 50 to 70 percent of regions that were deemed scar by the standard three- to four-hour redistribution protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The positive and negative predictive values for improvement in perfusion and wall motion are in the range of 85 percent with this technique, significantly higher than those of redistribution imaging alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An equally accurate method for establishing hibernation is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography, which examines the inotropic or contractile reserve of dysfunctional but viable myocardium. Viable myocardium shows improved regional contractile function (inotropic reserve), as assessed by simultaneous transthoracic echocardiography, and increased metabolic activity in response to low dose dobutamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dobutamine stress echocardiography in the evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstable angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unstable angina encompasses a variety of clinical conditions, including the new onset of chest pain, progressive effort angina, rest angina, and post-myocardial infarction (MI) angina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As described below, severe myocardial ischemia or infarction produces regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography or perfusion defects on perfusion imaging. Studies in which coronary occlusion occurred during percutaneous coronary intervention have shown that regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography occur within 10 to 30 seconds, <strong>before</strong> the onset of electrocardiographic abnormalities or chest pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79335\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79335 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Among patients with unstable angina, the time course of myocardial recovery after the cessation of chest pain is variable, ranging from less than two hours in patients with a short duration of chest pain (&le;10 minutes) to more than 24 hours in patients with prolonged angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This delay in recovery, which occurs in the absence of recurrent chest pain, is thought to reflect myocardial stunning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>].</p><p>Hibernating myocardium also may be present, as patients with unstable angina who have not had a previous MI may have persistent reductions in perfusion and wall motion at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Abnormal preoperative regional wall motion function is reversible with CABG in 40 percent of these patients; this improvement in wall motion is associated with an improvement of global LV function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one series, patients with unstable angina and abnormal preoperative LV function at rest had a 5- and 10-year survival after CABG that was not significantly different from that of patients with normal preoperative LV function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Hibernating myocardium appears to be more common in unstable than stable angina (75 versus 28 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The greater frequency of hibernating myocardium may explain why the 10-year survival after CABG in this study was significantly higher in patients with unstable angina and preoperative LV dysfunction than in those with stable angina and preoperative LV dysfunction; in comparison, survival in unstable and stable angina was equivalent among patients who had normal preoperative LV function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with an ST elevation MI who are treated with reperfusion therapy have significant stunning with subsequent improvement in myocardial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. This was illustrated in the US HEART study, which evaluated 249 patients with anterior wall ST elevation MI in whom sequential echocardiograms were obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At 90 days, 22 percent of those with abnormal LV function and wall motion abnormalities had complete recovery and an additional 36 percent had partial recovery; most of the improvement occurred by day 14, consistent with the concept of myocardial stunning.</p><p>Myocardial hibernation in patients with MI can occur both in the area of infarction and in a region of the LV wall at a distance from the infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Support for this hypothesis comes from a report of 15 patients with single vessel coronary artery disease who were asymptomatic after an ST elevation MI and had no clinical or exercise-induced evidence of ischemia with thallium imaging; the patients were randomly assigned to either PTCA or conservative medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After a two-month follow-up, patients who underwent PTCA had improvements in coronary blood flow as measured with a Doppler flow wire, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">pathologic/normal</span> ratio after exercise, LV wall motion, and LVEF; the patients randomized to medical therapy showed either smaller or no changes in these parameters. These data clearly demonstrate the occurrence of hibernating myocardium in the infarcted area or in an area that was presumed to be infarcted.</p><p>Hibernating myocardium after MI is associated with a high incidence of subsequent cardiac events. One report evaluated 158 patients with an MI, 57 percent of whom had hibernating myocardium as demonstrated by increased 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. After a 23-month follow-up, a cardiac event (cardiac death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina, or late revascularization) occurred much more frequently in patients with evidence of hibernation (33 versus 3 percent). An increase in FDG uptake was the most significant predictor of a subsequent cardiac event, followed by the number of diseased vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe LV dysfunction or HF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of hibernating myocardium has been evaluated in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those referred for cardiac transplantation. The prevalence of hibernating myocardium was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 24 viability studies involving 3088 patients with coronary artery disease and LV dysfunction who had a mean LVEF of 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Viability was documented in 42 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, it has been estimated that more than 10 percent of patients referred for consideration of cardiac transplantation have an element of hibernating myocardium contributing to severe LV contractile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. As an example, one study of 112 cardiac transplant recipients found that severe coronary disease was found in all patients with a pretransplant diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy (57 percent of the total population); it was also present in 24 percent of patients with a pretransplant diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, LV dysfunction, no angina, and the lack of inducible ischemia by stress testing may also derive benefit by surgical revascularization if hibernating myocardium is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The decline in LV function that occurs with hibernating myocardium is associated with LV remodeling as manifested by increases in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and a more spherical shape of the LV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Revascularization leads to partial reversal of these abnormalities (reverse remodeling) and an increase in LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The degree of improvement is significantly correlated with the number of segments that recover function after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The possible benefit of revascularization with CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with coronary artery disease, LV dysfunction, and areas of hibernating myocardium is discussed separately.
