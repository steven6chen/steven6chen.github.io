The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but other possible sites include: cervical, interstitial (also referred to as cornual; a pregnancy located in the proximal segment of the fallopian tube that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus), hysterotomy (cesarean) scar, intramural, ovarian, or abdominal. In addition, in rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both a uterine and extrauterine pregnancy).</p><p>The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is based upon a combination of measurement of the serum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin and findings on transvaginal ultrasonography.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy will be reviewed here. This topic will focus mainly on the diagnosis of tubal pregnancy. The surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy is reviewed elsewhere.

Ectopic pregnancy may also be asymptomatic.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of ectopic pregnancy typically appear six to eight weeks after the last normal menstrual period, but may occur later, especially if the pregnancy is at an extrauterine site other than the fallopian tube.</p><p>Normal pregnancy discomforts (eg, breast tenderness, frequent urination, nausea) are sometimes present in addition to the symptoms specifically associated with ectopic pregnancy. There may be a lower likelihood of early pregnancy symptoms in women with ectopic pregnancy because progesterone, estradiol, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be lower in ectopic pregnancy than in normal pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 2026 pregnant women who presented to the emergency department with first-trimester vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, 376 (18 percent) were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy. Of these 376 women, 76 percent had vaginal bleeding and 66 percent had abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a population-based registry of ectopic pregnancy from France, the incidence of rupture was 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>An ectopic pregnancy may be unruptured or ruptured at the time of presentation to medical care. Tubal rupture (or rupture of other structures in which an ectopic pregnancy is implanted) can result in life-threatening hemorrhage. Any symptoms suggestive of rupture should be noted. These include severe or persistent abdominal pain or symptoms suggestive of ongoing blood loss (eg, feeling faint or loss of consciousness).</p><p>Based upon the concern about the risk of rupture at the time or after presentation, clinicians should consider ectopic pregnancy as a diagnosis in any woman of reproductive age with vaginal bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain who has the following characteristics: (1) pregnant, but does not have a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy (IUP); (2) pregnancy status uncertain, particularly if amenorrhea of &gt;4 weeks preceded the current vaginal bleeding; (3) in rare cases, a woman who presents with hemodynamic instability and an acute abdomen that is not explained by another diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116040124\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume and pattern of vaginal bleeding vary, and there is no bleeding pattern that is pathognomonic for ectopic pregnancy. Bleeding may range from scant brown staining to hemorrhage. Bleeding is typically intermittent, but may occur as a single episode or continuously.</p><p>The vaginal bleeding associated with ectopic pregnancy is typically preceded by amenorrhea. However, some women may misinterpret bleeding as normal menses, and may not realize they are pregnant prior to developing symptoms associated with ectopic pregnancy. This is particularly true in women who have irregular menses or who do not keep track of menstrual cycles.</p><p>Bleeding occurs in many other conditions in early pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H116039975\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116040131\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain associated with ectopic pregnancy is usually located in the pelvic area. It may be diffuse or localized to one side. In cases in which there is intraperitoneal blood that reaches the upper abdomen or in rare cases of abdominal pregnancy, the pain may be in the middle or upper abdomen. If there is sufficient intraabdominal bleeding to reach the diaphragm, there may be referred pain that is felt in the shoulder. Blood pooling in the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas) may cause an urge to defecate.</p><p>The timing, character, and severity of abdominal pain vary, and there is no pain pattern that is pathognomonic for ectopic pregnancy. The onset of the pain may be abrupt or slow, and the pain may be continuous or intermittent. The pain may be dull or sharp; it is generally not crampy. The pain may be mild or severe. Tubal rupture may be associated with an abrupt onset of severe pain, but rupture may also present with mild or intermittent pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116040104\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178910237\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any women with a possible pregnancy who has vaginal bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain should be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy. The main goals and steps of the evaluation of a woman with a suspected ectopic pregnancy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm that the patient is pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H3247521245\" class=\"local\">'Serial hCG'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate the patient for hemodynamic instability, since rupture of the structure in which the ectopic pregnancy is implanted may cause hemorrhage. Failure to diagnose ectopic pregnancy before tubal rupture limits the treatment options and increases maternal morbidity and mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or ectopic (in rare cases, the pregnancy is heterotopic). Determine the site of the ectopic pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine whether the structure in which the pregnancy is implanted (most commonly, the fallopian tube) has ruptured and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform additional testing to guide further management (eg, blood type and antibody screen, pretreatment testing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101692266\"><span class=\"h2\">Step one: Confirm pregnancy and symptoms suggestive of ectopic pregnancy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H490226914\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A menstrual history should be taken and the estimated gestational age should be calculated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy should be elicited, including prior ectopic pregnancy, current use of an intrauterine device, prior tubal ligation, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82282 \">table 1</a>). However, over 50 percent of women are asymptomatic before tubal rupture and do not have an identifiable risk factor for ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A population-based French study identified four factors that increased the risk of rupture when an ectopic pregnancy was suspected: (1) never having used contraception, (2) history of tubal damage and infertility, (3) induction of ovulation, and (4) high level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, at least 10,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The focus should be on obstetric history and pelvic or abdominal surgical history and medical comorbidities that are potential contraindications for surgery or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy (eg, renal or hepatic disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment#H4000213197\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Choosing a treatment&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763389847\"><span class=\"h3\">Human chorionic gonadotropin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of hCG is performed initially to diagnose pregnancy and then followed serially to assess for ectopic pregnancy.</p><p>The initial test to diagnose pregnancy may be either a urine or serum hCG. Once a pregnancy is confirmed, if ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the serum quantitative hCG is then repeated serially (typically every two days) to assess whether the increase in concentration is consistent with an abnormal pregnancy. In some cases, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be made after a single measurement of hCG in combination with transvaginal ultrasound, if the hCG is above the discriminatory zone and transvaginal ultrasound shows no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy and the presence of findings that suggest an ectopic pregnancy. However, a finding of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy with an hCG level within the discriminatory zone is not always reliable. In stable patients, we repeat hCG measurement and ultrasound before providing the treatment. (See <a href=\"#H23033133\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23033094\" class=\"local\">'Clinical protocol'</a> below.)</p><p>In pregnant women, hCG can be detected in serum and urine as early as eight days after the luteinizing hormone surge (approximately 21 to 22 days after the first day of the last menstrual period in women with 28-day cycles). The hCG concentration in a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) rises in a curvilinear fashion until about 41 days of gestation, after which it rises more slowly until approximately 10 weeks, and then declines until reaching a plateau in the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is not possible to determine whether a pregnancy is normal from a single hCG level because there is a wide range of normal levels at each week of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy#H104487168\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Serum pregnancy test'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels#H17620527\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human chorionic gonadotropin: Testing in pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease and causes of low persistent levels&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H758639025\"><span class=\"h2\">Step two: Evaluate hemodynamic stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with ectopic pregnancy may become hemodynamically unstable if there is a rupture of and hemorrhage from the structure in which the pregnancy is implanted, usually the fallopian tube. Young patients may not exhibit unstable vital signs until they have lost a large volume of blood. Rupture should be suspected in women with a sudden onset of severe and persistent abdominal pain, rapid uterine bleeding, symptoms of faintness, or vital signs suggestive of hemodynamic compromise. If rupture is suspected, the patient should be transferred to an acute care facility where resuscitation and surgical treatment may be provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Circulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vital signs should be measured and hemodynamic stability assessed. In young, healthy patients with blood loss, assessing the vital signs should include an evaluation for postural change. However, vital signs, including postural changes, may be normal early in the course of significant bleeding due to compensatory mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The abdominal examination is often unremarkable or may reveal lower abdominal tenderness. If rupture with significant bleeding has occurred, the abdomen may be distended and diffuse, or localized tenderness to palpation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rebound tenderness may be found on examination.</p><p>A complete pelvic examination should be performed. The speculum examination is used to confirm that the uterus is the source of bleeding (rather than a cervical or vaginal lesion) and to assess the volume of bleeding by noting the quantity of blood in the vagina and presence or absence of active bleeding from the cervix.</p><p>A bimanual pelvic examination is performed; the examination is often unremarkable in a woman with a small, unruptured ectopic pregnancy. Palpation of the adnexa should be performed with only a small degree of pressure, since excessive pressure may rupture an ectopic pregnancy. Findings on examination may include cervical motion, adnexal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal tenderness. An extraovarian adnexal mass is noted in some women.</p><p>The uterus may be somewhat enlarged, but will likely be smaller than appropriate for gestational age. Uterine enlargement in women with ectopic pregnancy may be due to endocrine changes of pregnancy, rare cases of heterotopic pregnancy, or incidental uterine pathology (most commonly, uterine fibroids).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1714002880\"><span class=\"h3\">FAST ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient is not hemodynamically stable, she may be evaluated with abdominal ultrasound to assess quickly for intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Ultrasound evaluation performed as part of the initial examination and resuscitation of the trauma patient is known as the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Identification of intraperitoneal bleeding in a woman of reproductive age should be considered a potential ruptured ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. An unstable patient with this finding should undergo urgent surgical consultation and exploration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma'</a>.)</p><p>This approach should be reserved for hemodynamically unstable patient. Other women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be evaluated with transvaginal ultrasound.

TVUS should be performed at time of presentation with a suspected ectopic pregnancy and may need to be repeated, depending upon the hCG level or a suspicion of rupture. The ultrasound should be performed by a clinician with expertise in gynecologic ultrasound and with the evaluation of ectopic pregnancy, whenever possible.</p><p>TVUS alone (without measurement of hCG) can exclude or diagnose an ectopic pregnancy <strong>only</strong> if one of the following findings is present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings diagnostic of an IUP (ie, gestational sac with a yolk sac or embryo). However, in women who conceived with ovulation induction or in vitro fertilization, a heterotopic pregnancy may rarely occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings diagnostic of a pregnancy at an ectopic site (gestational sac with a yolk sac or embryo).</p><p/><p>In either case, a gestational sac alone is not sufficient for diagnosis. In some ectopic gestations, a pseudosac is formed, that is merely <span class=\"nowrap\">fluid/blood</span> in the endometrial cavity that may appear to be a gestational sac (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;, section on 'Pseudosac'</a>).</p><p>In the great majority of cases, either two findings above excludes or diagnoses an ectopic gestation. The rare exceptions are heterotopic pregnancies and misdiagnoses of an IUP (ie, interstitial pregnancy or rudimentary horn pregnancy). In a review of 568 cases of rudimentary uterine horn pregnancies from 1900 to 1999, a rupture rate of 50 percent was found with 80 percent occurring before the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H59122899\" class=\"local\">'Heterotopic pregnancy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>TVUS can also detect findings that are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of ectopic pregnancy. An extraovarian adnexal mass is the most common ultrasound finding in ectopic pregnancy and is present in 89 percent or more of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>If TVUS is nondiagnostic, it may be because the gestation is too early to be visualized on ultrasound. If so, serial measurements of the serum hCG concentration should be taken until the hCG discriminatory zone is reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23033094\" class=\"local\">'Clinical protocol'</a> below.)</p><p>The ultrasound examination is also used to evaluate whether rupture of the tube or other structure has occurred. A finding of echogenic fluid (consistent with blood) in the pelvic cul-de-sac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdomen is consistent with rupture. However, a small amount of fluid is present in many women and a small amount of blood may be present in other conditions (eg, spontaneous abortion). A ruptured ovarian cyst is another condition that is common in pregnant women and may result in a small or large amount of blood. Rupture is indicated by ultrasound findings of free fluid (blood) in the abdominal cavity.</p><p>Ultrasound evaluation for ectopic pregnancy versus IUP is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Either ultrasound or other abdominal imaging modalities are used for evaluation in the rare cases of abdominal pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-pregnancy-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-and-heterotopic-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal pregnancy, cesarean scar pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265533665\"><span class=\"h4\">hCG discriminatory zone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discriminatory zone is the serum hCG level above which a gestational sac should be visualized by TVUS if an IUP is present. In most institutions, the discriminatory zone is a serum hCG level of 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L;</span> however, some data suggest that an IUP may not be visible until a higher level is reached (3510 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Setting the discriminatory zone at 3510 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> minimizes the risk of interfering with a viable IUP, if present, but increases the risk of delaying diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. However, even in women with an hCG &gt;3510 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L,</span> if she is clinically stable, it is often prudent to get a follow-up ultrasound to exclude a viable IUP rather than treat for ectopic pregnancy. Management of women with ectopic pregnancy depends upon several factors and it is important to emphasize that a patient should not be treated for an ectopic pregnancy based upon a single assessment with ultrasound and hCG.

As noted above, the slowest recorded rise over 48 hours associated with a viable IUP was 35 percent. Also, the same laboratory should be used for serial measurements. (See <a href=\"#H3247521245\" class=\"local\">'Serial hCG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common protocol is to measure the hCG every two days. In our practice, we find that measurement every 72 hours is more practical than every 48 hours, and allowing 72 hours for doubling helps to avoid misclassifying those viable pregnancies with slower than average doubling times. Yet, in practice, management is usually based on clinical findings and by TVUS, with little emphasis on hCG doubling time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, the protocol is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>hCG is rising normally</strong> (increasing by &ge;35 percent in 48 hours OR doubling in 72 hours) &ndash; The patient should be evaluated with TVUS when the hCG reaches 3500 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>. At that time, an IUP or ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by TVUS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>hCG is rising, but NOT normally</strong> &ndash; The lack of a normal rise in hCG across three measurements (the initial serum quantitative hCG and two additional serial measurements) is consistent with an abnormal pregnancy (an ectopic gestation or IUP that will ultimately abort). The hCG level may be rising slowly or may plateau at or very close to the previous level. The clinician can be reasonably certain that a normal IUP is not present. The number of serial measurements to use to make the diagnosis has not been well studied. Some data suggest that use of three serial measurements is more effective than two measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In patients with an abnormal rise in hCG, the TVUS should be repeated. If there are findings that confirm an IUP, an ectopic pregnancy is excluded and the patient should be managed as a failed pregnancy. If an extraovarian adnexal mass consistent with an ectopic pregnancy is visualized, then medical or surgical treatment is administered for a presumed ectopic pregnancy. If an extraovarian adnexal mass is not visualized, some clinicians administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and others perform curettage to exclude an IUP and thereby avoid medical therapy of nonviable IUP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

To follow up with these patients, weekly hCG concentrations should be measured until the result is undetectable.</p><p/><p>Patients who are being followed for suspected ectopic pregnancy should be counseled about the risk of rupture and should be advised to call if symptoms associated with rupture occur. These include the new onset of or a significant worsening of abdominal pain, vaginal hemorrhage, or feeling faint. In addition, women with a suspected ectopic pregnancy should be counseled about possible outcomes of the evaluation, including viable IUP or the end of a pregnancy with treatment for ectopic pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>hCG above the discriminatory zone</strong> &ndash; For women with a quantitative serum hCG above the discriminatory zone, the results of TVUS guide management. If TVUS does not reveal an IUP and shows a complex extraovarian adnexal mass, an extrauterine pregnancy is almost certain. Treatment of ectopic pregnancy should be instituted. If the serum hCG level is &ge;3500 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and no intrauterine pregnancy is visible on TVUS, it is almost certain that the pregnancy is extrauterine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is less certain if no complex extraovarian adnexal mass can be visualized, since there is variability in the level of expertise among ultrasonographers. Furthermore, a serum hCG &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> without visualization of intrauterine or extrauterine pathology may represent a multiple gestation, since there is no proven discriminatory level for multiple gestations. For these reasons, our next step in this clinical scenario is to repeat the TVUS examination and hCG concentration two days later. If an IUP is still not observed on TVUS, then the pregnancy is abnormal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265534157\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional diagnostic tests have been used in women with suspected ectopic pregnancy.

A meta-analysis of 26 cohort studies including 9436 women in the first trimester of pregnancy evaluated use of a single measurement of serum progesterone for the diagnosis of a nonviable pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

We do not routinely measure serum progesterone. However, measurement of serum progesterone may be useful in a patient with abdominal pain and bleeding and who has a serum hCG level below that expected for her gestational age. It should be noted, however, that the definition of a low progesterone is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265533347\"><span class=\"h3\">Curettage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intrauterine location of a pregnancy is diagnosed with certainty if trophoblastic tissue is obtained by uterine curettage. Obviously, the use of curettage as a diagnostic tool is limited by the potential for disruption of a viable pregnancy. Moreover, false negatives can occur: chorionic villi are not detected by histopathology in 20 percent of curettage specimens from elective termination of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Pipelle endometrial biopsy is even less sensitive than curettage for detection of villi; sensitivities reported in two small series were 30 and 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. If curettage is performed, serum hCG levels can be followed post-curettage if histopathology does not confirm the clinical impression. When an IUP has been evacuated, hCG levels should drop by at least 15 percent the day after evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Some experts have recommended performing curettage only on women with both an hCG concentration below the discriminatory zone and a low doubling rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Heterotopic tubal pregnancies have been reported as late as 16 weeks of gestation, while abdominal or rudimentary horn pregnancies can continue to develop late in gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>The ultrasonographer should carefully examine not only the uterus but also the adnexa of women who conceive following IVF.

Almost all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (98 percent), but other possible sites include cervical, interstitial, hysterotomy (cesarean) scar, ovarian, or abdominal. In rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both a uterine and extrauterine pregnancy). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Uncommon sites of ectopic pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are the most common symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in any women of reproductive age with these symptoms, especially those who have risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82282 \">table 1</a>). However, over 50 percent of women are asymptomatic before tubal rupture and do not have an identifiable risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key components of the evaluation of a woman with suspected ectopic gestation are a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) examination and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level. The hCG is measured serially every two to three days. (See <a href=\"#H23033094\" class=\"local\">'Clinical protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing is performed to evaluate for anemia, for Rh(D) blood typing, and for pretreatment evaluation for potential <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16816345\" class=\"local\">'Additional laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is a clinical diagnosis made based upon serial hCG testing and TVUS. A diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy cannot be made based upon a single hCG result. Histologic confirmation of the diagnosis is not typically required. (See <a href=\"#H23033133\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3247521245\" class=\"local\">'Serial hCG'</a> above and <a href=\"#H116039937\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic criteria depend upon the relationship to the hCG discriminatory zone (serum hCG level above which a gestational sac should be visualized by TVUS if an intrauterine pregnancy [IUP] is present). The hCG level of the discriminatory zone varies, but in most institutions it is 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L;</span> however, some data suggest that an IUP may not be visible until a higher level is reached (3510 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span>.
