It is characterized by limitation of joint movement that is most marked in the small joints of the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thickening and waxiness of the skin are also common, particularly on the dorsal surface of the fingers, but these skin changes may occur in the absence of limited joint mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of limited joint mobility in diabetes mellitus has ranged from 8 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. This variability depends largely upon the population studied and the way in which joint mobility is measured. Care must also be taken to avoid confusion with other diabetic hand problems, such as Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tenosynovitis, trigger finger, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which may coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal complications in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). Limited joint mobility also occurs in the absence of diabetes, with prevalence figures varying between 12 and 25 percent in nondiabetic subjects of three studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>].</p><p>Limited joint mobility occurs in both type 1 (insulin-dependent) and type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. The risk increases with increasing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and the duration of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-11</a>], although it can occur early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence also increases with age and cigarette smoking in both diabetics and nondiabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Associations with other diabetic complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Two cross-sectional studies have investigated the prevalence of limited joint mobility in patients with diabetes over time:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children and adolescents between the ages of 7 to 18 years, the prevalence of limited joint mobility fell significantly from 31 to 7 percent, between 1976 to 1978 and 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults with type 1 diabetes (mean age 27 years) the prevalence decreased from 43 to 23 percent between 1981 and 1982 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In both studies, limited joint mobility was associated with longer duration of diabetes, but the severity of limited joint mobility declined over time. The authors of both studies postulated that improvements in long-term glycemic control over the last 20 to 30 years caused the reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The deposition of abnormal collagen in connective tissue around joints is thought to lead to the stiffening and associated skin changes of limited joint mobility. Enzymatic and nonenzymatic glycosylation of collagen, abnormal crosslinking of collagen (which results in resistance to degradation), and increased collagen hydration may all contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15-17</a>]. In addition, microangiopathy and neuropathy may contribute to contractures via fibrosis and disuse.</p><p>Early glycosylation of skin collagen can be decreased by improved glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. However, the long-term, cumulative damage due to the binding of advanced glycosylation end products to collagen is probably irreversible. There has been one case report of resolution of limited joint mobility in a patient with longstanding diabetes after pancreatic transplantation and consequent immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this particular case, resolution was possibly related to treatment with corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited joint mobility is painless. Patients come to the clinician when stiffness and contractures lead to decreased grip strength, declining ability to do fine movements, and difficulties with hand function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Examination of the hands may show contractures of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. The distal interphalangeal joints may also be involved, followed less commonly by wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and the axial skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Coexisting stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) and Dupuytren's contracture may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The findings in the hands may be confused with Dupuytren's contracture in some patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a>). There are two features that may be helpful in distinguishing between them:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited joint mobility involves all four fingers, whereas Dupuytren's contracture more commonly affects just the fourth and fifth digits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The taut fibrotic bands characteristic of Dupuytren's contracture are not often present in limited joint mobility.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two simple tests are used for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;prayer sign&quot; tests the ability to flatten the hands together as in prayer, facilitating recognition of contractures in the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70769 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;table top test&quot; assesses the ability to flatten the palm against the surface of a table, facilitating recognition of contractures in the metacarpophalangeal joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77892 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Goniometers can also be used to measure flexion and extension of finger and other joints, and they are of particular value in research studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although imaging studies are not typically used to diagnose limited joint mobility, thickening of the flexor tendon sheaths has been noted on ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings include thickening and edema of the flexor digitorum tendons and enhancement of the tendon sheaths, without involvement of the extensor tendons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATIONS WITH OTHER DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited joint mobility is strongly associated with the duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,24</a>]. There are conflicting data on the possible association of limited joint mobility with glycemic control and with microvascular and other complications of diabetes mellitus. Differences in patient populations, the definition of limited joint mobility, joints studied, and the methods of diagnosis contribute to this variability. In addition, there may be differences between longitudinal studies, where diabetes control is assessed over a period of time, and cross-sectional studies that depend on many fewer measurements of A1C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12266977\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of developing limited joint mobility increases with the duration of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,24</a>]. In a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial <span class=\"nowrap\">(DCCT)/Epidemiology</span> of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study (1217 patients followed for a mean of 24 years), limited joint mobility occurred in 66 percent of patients. The definition of limited joint mobility in this study, however, was very broad and included all upper limb musculoskeletal disorders associated with diabetes, such as adhesive capsulitis, Dupuytren's contracture, and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as stiffness of the hands, making comparisons difficult with other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For every ten years of diabetes duration, the risk of developing limited joint mobility increased two- to threefold (odds ratio [OR] 2.53 to 2.87 in multivariate analyses).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether diabetic control and limited joint mobility are correlated is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Although biochemical theories and some clinical evidence suggest that glycemic control may prevent or minimize limited joint mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>], other reports have shown no association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,25</a>]. A large cross-sectional study of 335 adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes found no evidence for an association between glycemic control and limited joint mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], while in the larger, longer duration, and more extensively characterized <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/EDIC</span> study cohort, limited joint mobility was related to higher levels of glycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Methodological differences, as discussed above, may be responsible for some of the variation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Microvascular complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are reports supporting the association of the disorder with retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,10,11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11,26</a>], nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,27</a>], and neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], findings that have not been confirmed in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,25</a>].</p><p>Gender may play a role in determining which diabetic complications are present in association with limited joint mobility. In a cross-sectional study in patients with type 1 diabetes, men with limited joint mobility were more likely to have proteinuria, retinopathy, and hypertension than men with normal joint motion; women with limited joint mobility did not have increased rates of these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>One prospective study evaluated 44 patients with and without limited joint mobility who did not have retinopathy and nephropathy at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. After 10 years, similar numbers of patients in both groups developed retinopathy and microalbuminuria.</p><p>However, a larger prospective study that followed 479 children from diagnosis of type 1 diabetes over a median 10.9 years showed that 35 percent developed limited joint mobility at a median age of 13 years and duration of diabetes of 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The risk of developing limited joint mobility was related to puberty and higher A1C levels. The development of limited joint mobility was also associated with an increased risk of microalbuminuria, independent of glycemic control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Foot ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors predispose to foot ulcers in diabetic patients, including neuropathy, high foot pressures, peripheral vascular disease, and trauma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>). Limited joint mobility in the metatarsophalangeal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and the subtalar joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] can contribute to high foot pressures, contributing to plantar ulceration. More than one-third of adolescents may have limited subtalar motion and approximately 20 percent have limited mobility of the first metatarsophalangeal joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited joint mobility is difficult to treat. Glycemic control should be optimized, although this may be of theoretical rather than practical benefit. In addition, physiotherapy with passive palmar stretching and occupational therapy may improve function. Stretching of the toes and subtalar joint has been suggested to reduce the risk of foot ulceration, but this is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Smoking should be discouraged. Drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> (which inhibits collagen crosslinking), aminoguanidine (which prevents glycosylation of proteins and diminishes glycosylation-related crosslinking), and the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil may eventually prove to be beneficial; however, they are not recommended at present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Injection of the palmar tendon sheath with corticosteroids was found in one study to improve the contractures of limited joint mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This report, however, was difficult to assess because of the frequent coexistence of trigger finger and limited joint mobility. The procedure was painful.</p><p>In contrast to the general irreversibility of limited joint mobility, other diabetic hand problems such as Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tenosynovitis, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy that can coexist with it are potentially treatable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal complications in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited joint mobility is a painless stiffening of the joints seen particularly in the hands in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The deposition of abnormal collagen in connective tissue around joints is thought to lead to the stiffening and associated skin changes of limited joint mobility. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence increases with duration of diabetes, and there is some evidence linking limited joint mobility to long-term glycemic control.
