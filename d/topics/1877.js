These epilepsy syndromes are distinguished from symptomatic focal epilepsy, which refers to epilepsy that results from brain injury or other structural brain disease. Thus, the benign focal epilepsies of childhood can be viewed as a spectrum of conditions with &quot;functional&quot; or &quot;nonlesional&quot; focal epileptogenicity, each characterized by location and seizure type(s). This is sometimes referred to as the benign childhood susceptibility syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The best-described syndromes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign (childhood) epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS or BECTS) or benign rolandic epilepsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign occipital epilepsy of childhood (Gastaut syndrome)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panayiotopoulos syndrome</p><p/><p>These disorders will be reviewed here.

Although more than one-fourth of patients have a family history of epilepsy, usually a focal epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], a lack of concordance among twin pairs has argued against a major role for Mendelian-inherited factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, the hallmark electroencephalographic (EEG) finding of centrotemporal spikes does appear to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In some families with this EEG trait, a linkage was found on chromosome 15q14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p>Mutations in the gene potassium channel, voltage gated KQT-like subfamily Q, member 2 (KCNQ2) have been identified in several families with BECTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mutations in glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl D-aspartate 2A (GRIN2A), a gene that encodes for the alpha-2 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, have also been identified in rare sporadic and familial cases of BECTS, as well as in patients with other clinical syndromes, including Landau-Kleffner and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Syndromes with electrical status epilepticus during sleep'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BECTS usually presents in early school-age children with normal development. The age of onset ranges from 3 to 13 years, with a peak incidence between 7 and 9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The most common seizure type is a focal seizure with motor symptoms involving the face and no impairment of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/8,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,18</a>]. The characteristic ictal symptoms correspond to the origin of seizures in the rolandic or perisylvian sensorimotor cortex, which represents the face and oropharynx, and include facial numbness or twitching, guttural vocalizations, hypersalivation, drooling, dysphasia, and speech arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. Motor activity in the upper, but not lower, extremity is also common. Three-quarters of seizures occur at night or on awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/8,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,18</a>]. </p><p>Although these focal seizures are the most frequent seizure type, they can go unnoticed, especially because they occur mainly in sleep. As a result, a common presentation of BECTS is a secondary generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. Overall, approximately half of children with BECTS have at least one secondary generalized seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Focal or generalized status epilepticus is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of children have postictal paresis, often in association with comorbid migraine headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>A distinct clinical subset of patients with BECTS has been described in seven patients who had typical EEG findings, but predominantly atonic seizures that occurred several times a day and began at a somewhat earlier age (mean 2.4 years) than children with more typical BECTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>A growing literature suggests that children with BECTS can have mild cognitive deficits and behavioral problems, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/27-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-40</a>]. In addition to the disease itself, potential causes of cognitive dysfunction in these children include antiseizure drugs, postictal decrements, and sleep disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review that included 18 studies on language function in children with BECTS compared with controls, the most consistent impairments were in phonologic processing and single-word reading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The mean effect size was highest for single-word reading (0.7 standard deviations below the control group). Deficits in both expressive and receptive language were also identified, although results were more heterogeneous across studies. In a separate systematic review, long-term memory storage and retrieval were the most affected domains on formal neuropsychologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EEG findings of BECTS are characteristic, with centrotemporal sharp waves (70 to 100 milliseconds) that have several distinctive features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75634\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75634 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/3,4,17,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,17,44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The morphology is biphasic, with a negative sharp peak followed by a positive rounded component (amplitude 50 percent of the negativity)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sharp waves often have a &quot;horizontal dipole,&quot; which typically reveals a maximum negativity in the centrotemporal region and a maximum positivity at the vertex or in the frontal region</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sharp waves often occur in repetitive bursts, and can be bilateral and independent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epileptiform activity is markedly activated by non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, and occasionally occurs only in sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/3,17,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,45</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The background EEG activity is normal</p><p/><p>Although this distinctive EEG appearance is highly associated with BECTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], these interictal centrotemporal spikes also occur in 1 to 2 percent of asymptomatic children without seizures as well as in other epilepsy syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests, including neurologic examination, neuropsychiatric examination, and imaging studies, are normal in BECTS.

Most longitudinal follow-up studies suggest that these cognitive impairments may resolve, with seizures, by adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]; however, at least one study found that there was evidence of enduring language deficits into early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Syncope-like seizures, with sudden loss of muscle tone and unresponsiveness with or without associated autonomic signs, have been described in up to half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Other common autonomic signs are pallor, miosis, incontinence, coughing, and hypersalivation. Cardiac disturbances are usually limited to tachycardia, but cardiopulmonary arrest has been described. Visual symptoms, usually a seizure aura, are variably present. Many seizures are characterized by progressive impairment of consciousness along with staring or head and eye deviation. In some seizures, focal or bilateral clonic activity occurs.</p><p>The seizures are usually nocturnal and last more than five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/74-78,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78,84</a>]. One-third to one-half of episodes last more than 30 minutes, representing a nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is uncommon.</p><p>A small number of patients (10 to 13 percent) with Panayiotopoulos syndrome also have or develop benign (childhood) epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS or BECTS), also known as benign rolandic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/74,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,81</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities of visual and visuoperceptual function are uncommon in children with the Panayiotopoulos syndrome, but have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) shows occipital spikes in approximately 75 percent of cases; however, epileptiform activity arising from other or even multiple areas is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/76,80,83,84,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,80,83,84,88</a>].

Because of the prominent dysautonomic features, these seizures can be mistaken for nonepileptic syndromes, including syncope, gastroenteritis, encephalitis, and migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/75,81,83,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,81,83,89,90</a>].</p><p>Panayiotopoulos syndrome can usually be distinguished from symptomatic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In TLE, autonomic symptoms are usually much less pronounced and occur near the end rather than at the beginning of the seizure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course of Panayiotopoulos syndrome is usually benign. Seizures are infrequent and almost half of patients have just a single seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/75,77,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,77,83,84</a>]. Spontaneous remission usually occurs within two to three years from onset. A few children develop drug-resistant seizures or neuropsychologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/77,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,80</a>]. Preexisting neurobehavioral disorders may be a risk factor for recurrent, more difficult to treat seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Prolonged seizures should be treated as nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Benzodiazepines are generally advocated as the initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/74,75,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75,81</a>]. However, there is no evidence that these prolonged seizures pose a risk of brain damage, and experts suggest avoiding &quot;over-treatment&quot; with multiple intravenous drugs that have the potential for cardiorespiratory complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of convulsive status epilepticus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prophylactic treatment is reserved for patients with frequent seizures or those with severe symptoms. Although any of the antiseizure drugs used for focal epilepsy may be used, there is the most experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a>, which is successful as monotherapy in most patients (88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Withdrawal of treatment is recommended within one to two years if seizures are not ongoing.</p><p>Rectal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> and instruction in its use should be provided to parents of children who have had a prolonged seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/74,75,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign occipital epilepsy of childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign occipital epilepsy of childhood, sometimes referred to as Gastaut syndrome, has a mean age of presentation of 8 to 9 years (range 3 to 16 years), which is somewhat later than in Panayiotopoulos syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/81,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,92</a>].</p><p>Seizures often include visual symptoms, either blindness or visual hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/79,83,92-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,83,92-97</a>]. Hemiclonic activity, automatisms, migraine-like headache, and versive movements can occur, and seizures may secondarily generalize. Compared with Panayiotopoulos syndrome, seizures are more frequent and of shorter duration, usually less than five minutes. Most seizures occur in the daytime.</p><p>The interictal EEG is similar to that in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, but with some differences: epileptiform activity is more predominantly occipital, often occurs in long bursts of spike-wave complexes, and is markedly activated by eye closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/55,93,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,93,97</a>]. Background activity is normal.</p><p>Because clinical and EEG features of symptomatic and benign idiopathic occipital epilepsy overlap substantially, MRI is generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood/abstract/47,79,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,79,97,98</a>].
