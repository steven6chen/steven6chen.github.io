The inflammatory infiltrate is sometimes accompanied by fibrosis, either in the form of abnormal collagen deposition or proliferation of fibroblasts capable of collagen synthesis.</p><p>Our understanding of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias has been plagued by our inability to clearly define the extent to which these represent distinct entities, as opposed to variations on the same fundamental theme. &quot;Lumpers&quot; have maintained that all are appropriately captured beneath the venerable umbrella of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, also referred to as cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis [CFA]), and that morphologic separations are misguided attempts to segregate what are in fact highly related points on the same continuum of fibrosing lung disease. &quot;Splitters&quot; respond that failure to control for histologic subtypes has impeded our efforts to explain or predict the seemingly capricious behavior of a family of similar but separable interstitial lung diseases.</p><p>The pathologic classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias is reviewed here. In additional, clinical features of each type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia are discussed. The diagnostic approach to patients with interstitial lung disease is presented elsewhere.

These categories of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) have persisted as important histologic groups, while bronchiolitis obliterans with classical interstitial pneumonia (BIP) and giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP) have disappeared from subsequent classification schemes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52032 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Regardless of the clinical context, however, he maintained that precise histological classification of interstitial pneumonias provides clues to etiology, pathogenesis, natural history, and prognosis. In other words, although individual histological patterns are not free-standing diagnostic entities, each significantly limits the differential diagnosis in terms of potential etiologies or clinical associations, and each has specific implications concerning likely treatment response and outcome.</p><p>For patients in whom open or thoracoscopically-guided lung biopsies show the histologic patterns encompassed under the heading of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, the biopsy is intended not only to confirm the suspicion of an interstitial pneumonia, but also to exclude various IPF mimics such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50172\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50172 \">algorithm 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The alveolar septa are lined by plump cuboidal pneumocytes and thickened by a sparse inflammatory infiltrate that often includes plasma cells and occasional eosinophils. There is usually minimal or mild associated fibrosis without honeycomb changes. The most striking feature is the presence of numerous mononuclear cells within most of the distal air spaces. These mononuclear cells represent smokers' macrophages rather than desquamated pneumocytes, as had been originally proposed. The smokers' macrophage is characterized by finely granular brown pigment flecked with tiny black particles.

Some patients have improved with smoking cessation alone, but others have progressed despite cessation of smoking.

Like DIP, RB-ILD is an uncommon form of interstitial pneumonia, accounting for only 2 percent of biopsied Mayo Clinic patients who were suspected of having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). DIP and RB-ILD show significant clinical, radiologic and histologic overlap, and in some patients the distinction is arbitrary and of uncertain clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Respiratory bronchiolitis was defined in 1974 as a distinct histopathologic entity characterized by the presence of pigmented intraluminal macrophages within first and second-order respiratory bronchioles. Investigators hypothesized that respiratory bronchiolitis might contribute to small airways dysfunction in cigarette smokers. The histopathologic finding of respiratory bronchiolitis has been linked to a syndrome of diffuse interstitial lung disease (respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease or RB-ILD) that can mimic IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

RB-ILD typically occurs during the fourth or fifth decades of life and almost always affects current smokers with average exposures of over 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68326 \">table 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Men are affected more often than women by a ratio of almost 2:1. Symptoms are usually mild and not disabling. Nearly all patients present with nonspecific respiratory complaints; these include the insidious onset of dyspnea and a new or changed cough. Chest radiographs are abnormal in 80 percent of patients and show diffuse fine reticular or reticulonodular opacities in a bibasilar distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68487%7EPULM%2F82553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68487 graphicRef82553 \">image 3A-B</a>).</p><p>In contrast to previous reports, the largest series of RB-ILD patients suggests that RB-ILD is not a benign disease and that symptoms and physiology improve in only a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The changes are patchy at low magnification and have a bronchiolocentric distribution. Respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and peribronchiolar alveolar spaces contain clusters of dusty brown macrophages. The lightly pigmented cells have abundant cytoplasm that contains finely granular golden brown particles. The cytoplasmic particles are periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive and also stain with Prussian blue. Positive staining with Prussian blue, an iron stain, correlates with observations of increased iron content in alveolar macrophages from cigarette smokers.</p><p>Intraluminal macrophages are accompanied by a patchy submucosal and peribronchiolar infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes. The interstitial histiocytes may contain dusty brown cytoplasmic pigment identical to that seen within the intraluminal macrophages, or they may contain coarse black anthracotic pigment. Peribronchiolar fibrosis is also seen and expands contiguous alveolar septa, which are lined by hyperplastic type 2 cells and cuboidal bronchiolar-type epithelium. The combination of alveolar septal thickening, epithelial hyperplasia, and pigmented intraluminal macrophages mimics the appearance of DIP.</p><p>The intraluminal macrophages in DIP usually contain dusty brown pigment identical to that seen in RB-ILD and show the same positive staining reactions with PAS and Prussian blue. The main feature that distinguishes DIP from RB-ILD is that DIP affects the lung in a more uniform and diffuse manner, lacking the bronchiolocentric distribution seen in RB-ILD, but there is considerable clinical, radiologic, and histologic overlap between these entities. It is likely that DIP and RB-ILD are highly related if not identical lesions, differing only in the severity and extent of the abnormality (ie, RB-ILD = <span class=\"nowrap\">mild/early</span> DIP). For that reason it has been suggested that all cases be grouped under the heading of RB-ILD, avoiding the historically entrenched but descriptively inaccurate term of &quot;desquamative&quot; interstitial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of RB-ILD includes a number of interstitial lung diseases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peribronchiolar fibrosis coupled with hyperplasia of peribronchiolar epithelium may mimic the appearance of UIP.

At low magnification, however, pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is a predominantly interstitial lesion characterized by the presence of centrally scarred stellate nodules containing a polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate. Diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma is predicated on recognition of characteristic Langerhans' cells within the inflammatory infiltrate in the appropriate histological context. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hemorrhage is also characterized by the presence of pigment-laden macrophages and can be confused with RB-ILD. Low magnification examination is helpful in distinguishing these conditions because the pigmented macrophages have a bronchiolocentric distribution in RB-ILD, as opposed to a more diffuse and random distribution in pulmonary hemorrhage. Other histological clues are often present in alveolar hemorrhage syndromes, including the presence of intraalveolar erythrocytes with associated fibrin, and areas of organization resembling organizing pneumonia. The pigment in RB-ILD, like the pigment in DIP and &quot;DIP-like&quot; reactions, is finely dispersed and indistinct, imparting a dusty appearance to the cells. In contrast, hemosiderin pigment in pulmonary hemorrhage forms large, coarse, refractile granules that often have a <span class=\"nowrap\">yellow/gold</span> hue. Both pigments stain positively with Prussian blue, but hemosiderin stains more brightly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Neither RB-ILD nor DIP should be viewed as free standing histopathologic entities, since areas resembling both are common as incidental findings in cigarette smokers. Given the dangers of sampling bias, RB-ILD and DIP should be diagnosed only when other forms of interstitial lung disease have been vigorously excluded, a process that requires correlation of biopsy findings with clinical and radiographic features. A review identified respiratory bronchiolitis in 109 of 156 consecutive surgical specimens; &quot;DIP-like&quot; areas were identified in 6. Only two (1.8 percent) patients were thought to have either RB-ILD (1) or DIP (1) after careful correlation with clinical, radiologic and pathologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23179520\"><span class=\"h1\">SMOKING-RELATED INTERSTITIAL ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subclinical interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) appear common in smokers and these findings do not meet criteria for usual interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary Langerhans histiocytosis. On high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), subclinical ILA are associated with parenchymal nodules with relatively low attenuation, ground-glass opacities, subpleural micronodules, and dependent areas of increased attenuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>].</p><p>These radiographic findings have not been closely examined histopathologically.

In contrast, acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) presents with the explosive onset of respiratory symptoms and is characterized by rapidly progressive respiratory failure associated with diffuse opacities on chest radiographs. This acute variant is analogous to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), differing only in that it is not preceded by a catastrophic event (ie, the condition is idiopathic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other terms have been proposed for this clinicopathological syndrome, including Hamman-Rich syndrome and accelerated interstitial pneumonia. Regardless of the terminology, the important point is that AIP should be distinguished from the group of chronic interstitial pneumonias because of marked differences in natural history. AIP has the same poor prognosis as ARDS, and the majority of patients die of respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The distinction depends not only on recognizing underlying UIP, but also on correlation with the clinical and radiographic findings. In a comparison of patients with AIP and patients suffering acute exacerbation of IPF reported only in abstract form, patients with accelerated IPF were older, more likely to have digital clubbing, and had radiographic features of UIP on HRCT scans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSPECIFIC INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is a pathologic description of a chronic interstitial pneumonia that lacks the histopathologic features typical of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), or acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60068 \">table 13</a>). These lesions are often characterized by a relatively uniform appearance at low magnification due to a cellular interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells associated with varying degrees of interstitial fibrosis. Examples of this condition have undoubtedly been included in studies of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as &quot;early&quot; or &quot;cellular&quot; UIP. In a retrospective review of patients suspected of having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 14 percent had nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), making it the second most common histological category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The most important clinical characteristics that distinguish NSIP from UIP are a subacute rather than insidious onset of symptoms, associated fever in about one-third of patients, lack of a strong male predominance, relative absence of clubbing in NSIP, and increased frequency of features suggestive of connective tissue disease.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the clinical manifestations, risk factors, prognosis, evaluation, and treatment of NSIP is provided separately.
