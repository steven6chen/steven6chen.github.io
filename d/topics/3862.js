Most patients with HFpEF also display normal left ventricular volumes and evidence of diastolic dysfunction (eg, abnormal pattern of LV filling and elevated filling pressures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. By contrast, HF with a reduced EF (HFrEF) is characterized by increased LV volumes and reduced EF. Previously, HFpEF was termed &quot;diastolic HF&quot; and HFrEF was described as &quot;systolic HF.&quot; </p><p>HFpEF should be distinguished from other causes of HF with an LVEF &gt;50 percent such as valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and high output HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54975 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of patients with HFpEF will be reviewed here.

A Mayo Clinic study examined all consecutive patients hospitalized with decompensated HF from 1987 through 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The proportion of patients with the diagnosis of HFpEF increased over time and was significantly higher among community patients than among referral patients (55 versus 45 percent). Over the next decade (2000 through 2010), the proportion of HF patients with HFpEF continued to increase while the incidence of HFpEF and HF with reduced EF declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additional data from the ARIC study show that HFpEF is by far the dominant form of HF among older adults in the United States, representing 65 to 77 percent of prevalent cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This study also showed that the majority of adults in the community have either risk factors for HF (Stage A, 52 percent) or structural remodeling (Stage B HF, 30 percent) and are thus at increased risk for developing symptomatic HF (Stage C 13 percent).</p><p>HFpEF is more common in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. In a review of over 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with the principal discharge diagnosis of HF, 35 percent had a normal EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among patients with normal EF, 79 percent were women, while among those with decreased EF, 49 percent were women. Data from randomized clinical trials in patients with HFpEF are consistent with these epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is much more common than HFpEF. Thus, it is important to recognize that the presence of diastolic dysfunction and an EF &gt;50 percent does not indicate HFpEF unless the clinical syndrome of HF is present. This is illustrated by a community-based survey that evaluated 2042 subjects &ge;45 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The overall prevalence of clinical HF in this study was 2.2 percent; of these, almost half had HFpEF. Among subjects without HF, 28.1 percent had some degree of diastolic dysfunction using Doppler echocardiographic criteria. The prevalence and severity of diastolic dysfunction increases with age and the development or worsening of diastolic dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of developing HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

In addition to the above contributors, these include lung disease and anemia. Although comorbidities are an important contributor to the outcome in HFpEF, HFpEF is more than a collection of associated conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Occult coronary heart disease is a potentially reversible cause of HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Symptoms and signs include dyspnea (including dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea), fatigue, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary rales, and lower extremity edema. Many patients present with symptoms of exertional chest pain, so the diagnosis of HFpEF should be entertained in such patients when significant epicardial coronary disease is not observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].

An electrocardiogram is routinely performed in patients with HF, although findings are often nonspecific. Evidence of myocardial ischemia or prior infarction may be detected. Atrial fibrillation is frequently seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>The similarity in clinical manifestations for HFpEF and HFrEF was illustrated in a report in which clinical data from 59 patients aged at least 60 years with symptoms of HF and a left ventricular EF (LVEF) &ge;50 percent were compared with data from 60 patients of the same age with HF and an LVEF &le;35 percent and from 28 age-matched healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

As detailed below, the diagnosis is generally made by history and physical examination, echocardiography, and sometimes cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/1,3,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,43</a>]. </p><p>Diagnostic criteria for HFpEF are included in the major society HF guideline documents and there is reasonable consensus about the minimum criteria necessary to make this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/1,57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,57-60</a>]. In practice, the combination of symptomatic HF and a normal LVEF is often used to identify HFpEF in epidemiologic studies, while further testing (usually Doppler echocardiography) is typically performed to diagnose HFpEF in the clinical setting. </p><p>The following diagnostic approach is suggested. The diagnosis of HFpEF is established in a patient with a nondilated left ventricle with LVEF &gt;50 percent with three or more of the bulleted criteria below, after exclusion of other causes (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). The diagnosis of HFpEF is very unlikely if none of the bulleted criteria are present. A diagnosis of HFpEF is uncertain in a patient with nondilated left ventricle with LVEF &gt;50 percent, one or two of the bulleted criteria, and absence of other causes; in such patients, a cardiac catheterization with exercise is suggested to invasively confirm elevation in cardiac filling pressures at rest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> during provocative maneuvers.

In patients with kidney disease who may have volume overload and natriuretic peptide elevation secondary to renal dysfunction, additional clinical evidence of HF should be evaluated to support the diagnosis of HFpEF.

It was previously referred to as diastolic HF. (See <a href=\"#H4750683\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is much more common than HFpEF and is prevalent in the population at greatest risk for HFpEF. Thus, it is important to be certain of the diagnosis of HF. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and demographics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4750683\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major contributors to HFpEF are systolic hypertension with and without left ventricular hypertrophy, aging, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, and coronary heart disease. Occult coronary heart disease is a common and potentially reversible cause of HFpEF. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFpEF and HF with reduced EF have similar symptoms and signs. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP may be elevated or normal in patients with HFpEF. (See <a href=\"#H1143535079\" class=\"local\">'Natriuretic peptide level'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HFpEF is made in patients with symptoms and signs of HF by confirming the presence of HF, identifying whether the LVEF is preserved, identifying supporting features (particularly evidence of diastolic dysfunction or clinical evidence of congestion), and exclusion of other causes of HF with LVEF &gt;50 percent. The diagnosis is generally made by history and physical examination and echocardiography (with the possible addition of tests such as plasma natriuretic peptide level or cardiopulmonary exercise testing). (See <a href=\"#H4750683\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the utility of noninvasive methods, cardiac catheterization is not routinely required for diagnosis and evaluation of HFpEF. However, for patients for whom the pretest probability of HFpEF remains intermediate after noninvasive evaluation, invasive hemodynamic assessment of cardiac filling pressures, with provocative stress maneuvers such as exercise, is useful as the clinical gold standard to make or exclude the diagnosis of HFpEF. (See <a href=\"#H617998763\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFpEF is one of several causes of the clinical syndrome of HF in patients with a normal LVEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54975 \">table 1</a>). Conditions such as valvular heart disease (especially mitral valve disease), pericardial disease, cardiac amyloid, hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, and high output HF can also produce HF with an LVEF &gt;50 percent but should be considered separately from HFpEF. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of patients with HFpEF includes determining the severity (and associated prognosis) of HF and identifying the cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54975 \">table 1</a>), as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H514319026\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2219617\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Drs.
