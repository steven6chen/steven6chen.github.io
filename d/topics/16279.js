The spine doesn't form normally when the baby develops in the mother's uterus (womb).</p><p>Spina bifida is a type of birth defect called a neural tube defect. There are different kinds of neural tube defects and different forms of spina bifida. This article discusses the most serious form of spina bifida, which is also called &quot;open spina bifida&quot; or &quot;myelomeningocele.&quot;</p><p>When babies have spina bifida, the bones of the spine don't form normally. As a result, these babies have an opening in their skin in the middle or lower part of the back. The spinal cord (the bundle of nerves that run down the back) and the covering around the spinal cord stick out of the opening.</p><p>Spina bifida leads to different problems. The exact problems will depend on your child's individual situation. But in general, spina bifida can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness of the legs, or being unable to move the legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of feeling in the legs or lower half of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the feet, knees, hips, legs, or spine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems controlling the bladder or bowel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with learning, attention, or memory</p><p/><p>Most children with spina bifida also have a condition called hydrocephalus, which is when there is too much spinal fluid in the brain. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. Hydrocephalus can make a baby's head get bigger over a short period of time, and can put pressure on the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766571\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes spina bifida?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors don't usually know what causes spina bifida. But they do know that spina bifida can happen when a pregnant woman doesn't get enough <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> during pregnancy. Folic acid (also called folate) is a vitamin needed for the baby's spine and other parts of the body to develop normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766586\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for spina bifida?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. In the fourth month of pregnancy, women can have a blood test that checks how likely it is that their baby has spina bifida. If this test shows it's likely their baby has spina bifida, the doctor will order a test called an ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to check how a baby is growing and how his or her organs are developing. It can show whether a baby has spina bifida. Some women have an ultrasound without having the blood test.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors also do a test called amniocentesis. During this test, a doctor uses a thin needle to remove a small amount of amniotic fluid (the fluid surrounding the baby in the mother's uterus) from a pregnant woman&rsquo;s belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53857 \">figure 1</a>). Tests on the fluid can show whether a baby has spina bifida.</p><p>After birth, a doctor or midwife can tell whether a baby has spina bifida by doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766618\"><span class=\"h1\">How is spina bifida treated during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some specialized medical centers offer fetal surgery. This involves fixing the defect before the baby is born. This surgery has risks for both the mother and baby.</p><p>Some women who find out their baby has spina bifida might choose to end their pregnancy. Women who choose to continue their pregnancy should make sure to deliver their baby in a hospital or center that has experience treating babies with spina bifida.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766633\"><span class=\"h1\">How is spina bifida treated after birth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soon after birth, your baby will need surgery to close the opening in his or her back. Until the surgery can be done, the doctor will keep this open area covered and protected. He or she will also give your baby antibiotics to prevent an infection.</p><p>Babies with spina bifida are checked for hydrocephalus. To check for hydrocephalus, the doctor will order an ultrasound of your baby's head. The doctor or nurse will also measure the size of your baby's head every few days.</p><p>Babies who have hydrocephalus are usually treated with a device called a shunt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83273\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83273 \">figure 2</a>). A shunt is a long tube that goes in the fluid-filled space in the brain. The tube is placed under the skin and empties into the belly or heart. It helps drain extra spinal fluid from the brain.</p><p>Other treatments will depend on the problems your child has from his or her spina bifida. Treatment for spina bifida is life-long. Many children with spina bifida:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a wheelchair or wear leg braces to help them walk</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a tube called a catheter to help them empty their bladder, if their bladder doesn't work normally &ndash; This helps prevent infections and kidney damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have surgery to fix problems with their spine or legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have testing to check whether they have learning problems &ndash; Some children with learning problems need a special learning plan for school.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766665\"><span class=\"h1\">Can spina bifida be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting enough <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> during pregnancy can prevent some cases of spina bifida. To help prevent spina bifida, a woman should start taking a daily multivitamin with folic acid or prenatal vitamin <strong>before </strong>she gets pregnant. That's because by the time a woman finds out she is pregnant, her baby's spine and nervous system have already started to develop.</p><p>Women who take medicines called anti-seizure medicines might need extra <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>. That's because anti-seizure medicines can lower the amount of folic acid in the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766680\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your child's individual situation. Children who are born with spina bifida are healthier and living longer today than they did only a few decades ago. </p><p>To help your child stay as healthy as possible, it's important to work closely with his or her team of doctors, nurses, and other professionals. Follow their instructions about visits, tests, and treatments. Let them know if you see any changes in your child's symptoms or health. These could be caused by problems from the spina bifida and need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262766695\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abortion-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Abortion (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy and pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abortion-pregnancy-termination-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abortion (pregnancy termination) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
