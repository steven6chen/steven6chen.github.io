Surgical and medical interventions have improved outcomes of this condition, which untreated is fatal. However, mortality remains high, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 65 percent even after surgical repair.</p><p>The management and outcome of hypoplastic left heart syndrome will be reviewed here. The anatomy, physiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of HLHS and management of patients following the Fontan procedure are discussed separately.

HLHS remains one of the most challenging congenital heart defects to manage because of its high mortality and morbidity. However, innovations and improvements in medical and surgical care have improved outcomes, and more families are choosing intervention over comfort care measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1912036134\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staged palliative surgery is the management choice for HLHS over cardiac transplantation and compassionate care by most pediatric cardiologists and surgeons in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Within the pediatric cardiology community, there remains a debate as to whether compassionate care should be offered as an option to parents in light of the improving outcome of the staged surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although some experts feel that compassionate care should not be offered as an option, others argue parents should be given the opportunity to consider compassionate care alone because surgical palliation still has unknown long-term morbidity, the burden (eg, pain and suffering) of multiple cardiac operations, and the still considerable mortality rate. Currently, the trend is to refer affected neonates to tertiary centers for surgical palliation versus comfort care measures or cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].</p><p>At the author's institution, the management choice is dependent on parent preference after ensuring that parents understand the different management options.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During prenatal counseling, discussion with the parents includes the natural history of HLHS and the prenatal management decisions including termination of the pregnancy, pursuit of additional prenatal testing, choice of delivery setting, and, where applicable, possibility of fetal intervention. The postnatal management choices are also discussed, including staged palliative surgery, cardiac transplantation, and compassionate care. Longitudinal follow-up after prenatal diagnosis of HLHS suggests that 40 percent of these pregnancies end in termination or demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal counseling includes discussion of staged surgical palliation, including a careful presentation of outcomes. Most parents choose staged surgical palliation, and compassionate care is rarely selected as an alternative for infants without other major malformations, extreme prematurity, or compromising genetic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In highly selected cases of critical aortic valve stenosis and preserved left ventricular volume in the second trimester, prenatal intervention to perform aortic valvuloplasty can prevent the progression to neonatal HLHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. This ultrasound-guided, transcatheter procedure poses significant risks to the fetus and some risk to the mother as well. These risks have been felt to be justifiable given the uniform lethality of the untreated disease and the significant mortality associated with postnatal management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250708383\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management is focused on providing sufficient mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and adequate systemic perfusion by maintaining a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) infusion, and if necessary, creating an adequate atrial septal defect (ASD) by balloon atrial septostomy (BAS).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous intravenous prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>; 0.01 to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute) is used to maintain a PDA once the diagnosis of HLHS is made or suspected.

However, because of the scarcity of infant donors and the improving short-term success of the staged palliative procedures, the staged repair is the preferred surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Surgical palliation of HLHS consists of three staged procedures typically performed at the following ages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First stage (eg, Norwood procedure) is performed in neonates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second stage (bidirectional Glenn procedure) is typically performed at 3 to 6 months of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third stage (Fontan procedure) is typically performed at 18 to 30 months of age</p><p/><p>These interventions are referred to as palliative procedures because they do not restore the patient to a normal biventricular circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1474255318\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fundamental objectives of initial surgical management (eg, Norwood procedure) are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide unobstructed blood flow from the right ventricle (RV) to the systemic circulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish a controlled source of pulmonary blood flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure an unobstructed pathway between the pulmonary venous return and the systemic RV</p><p/><p>Stage I procedures include the Norwood procedure, the Sano procedure, and the hybrid approach (combines interventional cardiac catheterization techniques with surgery) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81022 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4000523369\"><span class=\"h4\">Norwood procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic Norwood stage I operation consists of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81022 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creation of a neoaorta by dividing the main pulmonary artery, closing the defect in the distal vessel, and using the proximal main pulmonary artery and homograft material to reconstruct the aortic arch, which incorporates the native ascending aorta</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of a source of pulmonary blood flow by placing a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt, typically using a 3.5 mm Gore-Tex tube, between the innominate artery and the proximal right pulmonary artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of the atrial septum</p><p/><p>The Norwood procedure results in a functionally univentricular circulation maintained by the RV with a goal of achieving a favorable distribution of blood flow to the pulmonary and systemic circulation, thereby providing adequate oxygen delivery to the systemic organs and tissues without excessive pressure or volume load on the RV, and avoiding excessive systemic cyanosis.</p><p>Surgical mortality associated with the Norwood stage I is sufficiently high that this operation ranks in the highest risk category of the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS) scoring system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. With increasing experience with this procedure, however, select tertiary centers have reported improved early survival rates that approach 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Patient-related variables identified as risk factors for mortality include low gestational age, weight &lt;2.5 kg, and concomitant noncardiac diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Anatomic variants such as restriction of the atrial septum, mitral stenosis with aortic atresia, and small size of the ascending aorta also appear to increase the risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Finally, functional factors that may reflect the preoperative clinical status of the patient, such as tricuspid regurgitation and RV dysfunction, have been shown to be associated with poorer outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247304320\"><span class=\"h4\">Sano procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the undesirable consequences of the classic Norwood procedure is that blood flow through the BT shunt into the pulmonary circulation results in diastolic diversion of flow from the systemic circulation including, most importantly, the coronary circulation. Given the difficulty in managing the balance of pulmonary and systemic circulations in the early postoperative Norwood stage I patient, alternative stage I-type palliations have been explored. Of these, the Sano procedure has become widely adopted after the initial report of its successful application in a series of 27 patients, which included only two operative deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The Sano procedure modifies the Norwood procedure by creating a right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit (typically a 5 to 6 mm expanded poly-tetrafluoroethylene tube) as a source of pulmonary blood flow instead of the BT shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Reports from several centers have shown better survival rates in patients with Sano procedures compared with historical controls who underwent Norwood procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. One disadvantage to the Sano procedure is the need for an RV incision, with the attendant risk of negative effects on long-term function of the systemic RV.</p><p>A randomized clinical trial (Single Ventricle Reconstruction [SVR] trial) of 555 subjects cared for at 15 North American centers conducted by the Pediatric Heart Network compared the outcomes of stage I repair using either the BT shunt or the RV-PA conduit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. At three-year follow-up, there was no difference in transplantation-free survival between patients who received the RV-PA conduit compared with those with a BT shunt (67 versus 61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The RV-PA conduit group had a slightly worse RV ejection fraction (42 versus 45 percent) and underwent more catheter interventions over time. Analyses of cardiac anatomy using echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients enrolled in the SVR trial demonstrated that after completion of stage II palliation, patients who initially underwent the Sano procedure had larger RV volumes and reduced strain patterns compared with those who underwent BT shunt, suggesting that long-term ventricular function may be better preserved in those receiving BT shunt initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>In a smaller German case series of 109 patients undergoing Norwood procedure, there was no difference in mortality rates for patients undergoing a BT shunt compared with those treated with an RV-PA conduit, with a 78 percent survival rate for both groups eight months post-procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, similar to the SVR trial, those in the RV-PA shunt group were more likely to undergo shunt interventions than those in the BT group.</p><p>In a prospective observational study of 338 patients undergoing the Norwood procedure at 21 North American institutions, propensity-score matching was used to pair patients who had a BT shunt placed (n = 169) with those who had an RV-PA conduit placed (n = 169) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Overall six-year survival was better after Norwood procedure with an RV-PA conduit compared with BT shunt (70 versus 55 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83433144\"><span class=\"h4\">Hybrid procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sustainable balance of systemic and pulmonary circulations in the post-Norwood patient is particularly difficult to achieve early after surgery, following a prolonged period of cardiopulmonary bypass (typically between 1.5 and 3 hours) and exposure to circulatory arrest. A &quot;hybrid&quot; approach using a combination of surgical and transcatheter approaches accomplishes the goals of stage I palliative repair without neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest, thus avoiding the circulatory stressors imposed by the post-bypass inflammatory state, myocardial reperfusion effects, and recovery from extensive dissection through a median sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The hybrid procedure entails the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic outflow is first secured by using catheter techniques to place an intravascular stent in the ductus arteriosus, thus allowing the RV to continue to support the systemic circulation without surgically anastomosing the main pulmonary artery to the aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary blood flow is then controlled by surgically placing external constricting bands on the branch pulmonary arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The atrial septum is finally treated by catheter techniques with BAS or placement of a stent in the interatrial septum.</p><p/><p>In one observational report of 40 selected patients, the survival rate to hospital discharge was 90 percent with an average length of stay that was approximately one-half of that of traditional surgical approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The optimal use of the hybrid procedure has not been defined, and there is considerable variability among centers in patient selection, procedural details, and subsequent management. The hybrid procedure is performed in the minority of cases, and patients selected for this procedure frequently have underlying risk factors. A report from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database included data on 1728 patients with HLHS managed at 100 centers in North America in 2010 through 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The hybrid procedure was the initial palliation in 13 percent; 52 percent had at least one preoperative risk factor (including prematurity, low birth weight, chromosomal abnormalities, and organ dysfunctions such as shock, necrotizing enterocolitis, and renal dysfunction) compared with 37 percent of patients who underwent the Norwood procedure.</p><p>There are limited data comparing outcomes with the hybrid and Norwood procedures. In a retrospective study from a single center of 119 neonates with functionally single ventricle physiology who underwent stage I repair using standard Norwood, Sano, or hybrid approach, 75 who completed stage II after either Norwood or hybrid were reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There was little difference between these two groups in mortality or rate of transplantation after the second stage. Patients who initially underwent hybrid palliation had higher reintervention rates for pulmonary artery obstruction following stage II. With continued follow-up of this cohort through Fontan completion, there was no difference among the three surgical palliative strategies in mortality, and interstage ventricular function or atrioventricular valve regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These results suggest that initial palliation procedure should be based on the surgeon's experience and preference, and institutional familiarity with the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3140753595\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-stage I management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following stage I palliation, infants typically are discharged from the hospital three to four weeks postoperatively with oxygen saturation levels in the range of 75 to 80 percent. These survivors remain at risk of for interstage mortality following discharge from the hospital and prior to further surgical intervention. Reported interstage mortality rates range from 4 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/14,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31-33</a>]. Causes of deaths include arrhythmias, residual anatomic lesions (aortic arch obstruction, restriction at the level of the atrial septum), shunt stenosis or thrombosis, imbalance of pulmonary and systemic blood flow, volume overload of the single ventricle, and diastolic run-off with coronary ischemia.</p><p>Strategies aimed at reducing interstage mortality and morbidity between stages I and II include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing appropriate caregiver preparation during the stage I hospitalization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing caregivers with a red flag action plan</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimizing feeding and weight gain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing collaboration between the family, primary care provider, cardiologist, and other team members</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardizing assessments and action plans at clinic visits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performing home monitoring of oxygen saturation and weight gain</p><p/><p>Patients who are discharged home after stage I palliation typically are managed by an intensive home monitoring program that includes daily measurements of weight and oxygen saturation. Home care providers are given parameters that should prompt notification of the medical team for further evaluation and changes in management. This practice is based upon data from a single-center study that showed reduced mortality following initiation of a home surveillance program (interstage mortality fell from 15.8 percent [9 of 57] before initiation of the program to 0 percent [0 of 24] after) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A subsequent study using data from the multicenter National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPC-QIC), found that home oxygen and weight monitoring were not associated with reduced interstage mortality or unplanned readmissions compared with no monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the study was limited in that very few patients in the cohort received no home monitoring (7 percent [36 of 494] had no home oxygen monitoring and 12 percent [57 of 472] had no home weight monitoring). Whether or not intensive home monitoring improves outcomes, it is important to recognize that this is just one factor that may contribute to interstage outcome. Other activities related to caregiver engagement and care coordination are also likely to have important effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3905079211\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage II: Cavopulmonary shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second stage of surgical palliation for HLHS is the superior cavopulmonary shunt, also known as the bidirectional Glenn operation. This stage is typically performed when the patient reaches three to six months of age as he or she begins to outgrow his or her original shunt, and becomes progressively more cyanotic. At stage II, the original shunt is removed and the superior vena cava is anastomosed end-to-side to the (typically right) pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58235 \">figure 3</a>). Thus, systemic venous return from the superior vena cava enters the pulmonary arteries directly.</p><p>The optimal timing for undertaking stage II palliation is uncertain. This was the subject of a study using data from the SVR trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Of 399 patients who survived to stage II, 349 (87 percent) survived to a three-year follow-up, and transplant-free survival was 68 percent. Transplant-free survival was highest among patients who underwent stage II at an interval of three to six months following stage I. Optimal timing of the stage II palliation did not differ by shunt type.</p><p>Patients whose stage I was performed in a &quot;hybrid&quot; fashion require a more extensive stage II operation. In these patients, the ductal stent is removed and the surgical aortopulmonary reconstruction is completed. The distal main pulmonary artery is repaired, and the pulmonary arterial bands are removed.</p><p>Estimated surgical mortality following a traditional bidirectional Glenn procedure is low (between 1 and 2 percent), as the repair resolves the issue of balancing pulmonary and systemic flow through a shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Data from the NPC-QIC showed postoperative complications were common and included reoperation, cardiac arrest, new neurologic deficit including seizures, and <span class=\"nowrap\">feeding/gastrointestinal</span> difficulties that resulted in interventions (ie, fundoplication, and gastric-tube or feeding tube placement). In a multivariate analysis, risk factors for postoperative complications included failure to thrive, female gender, and the presence of aortic atresia and mitral stenosis.</p><p>The post-Glenn circulation is characterized by a passive source of pulmonary blood flow, a volume-unloaded ventricle, and persistent cyanosis due to the obligate flow of inferior vena caval return to the RV, which supplies the systemic arterial output. Infants are typically hospitalized for one week postoperatively and have oxygen levels in the low 80s at discharge. Following stage II, there is a low mortality rate and most children are initially fine with this level of systemic oxygenation. As children become more active with crawling, walking, and subsequently running, the degree of cyanosis becomes more severe, especially during periods of exercise and exertion. At this point, stage III repair should be considered. In addition, a small subset of patients will have ventricular dysfunction, which is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3059265159\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage III: Fontan procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The third stage, also referred to as the Fontan procedure, creates a venous pathway (total cavopulmonary connection) that directs the inferior vena caval flow into the pulmonary arteries resulting in the entire systemic venous return flowing passively into the pulmonary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74164 \">figure 4</a>). This creates a system with a single ventricle pumping blood into separate, in-series systemic and pulmonary circulations, thereby relieving cyanosis.</p><p>This procedure has a low mortality rate (3 percent) similar to stage II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although this total cavopulmonary connection is sometimes presented as the final stage of palliation for HLHS, follow-up after the Fontan procedure has demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients may require additional intervention due to cyanosis, elevated central venous pressures, persistent anatomic obstructions, arrhythmia, valve dysfunction, or ventricular dysfunction. Failure of the Fontan circulation may present as rare complications such as protein-losing enteropathy, which occurs in 6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Plastic bronchitis, similarly, is rare, but may require takedown of the Fontan or heart transplant to relieve symptoms.</p><p>Patients with HLHS may have long-term complications following Fontan completion, as it remains unknown how well the morphologic RV, which is responsible for sustaining both systemic and pulmonary flow, will perform into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. It is expected that the function of these ventricles will decline over time based on observations of RV function in the systemic circulations of other cardiac disorders, such as following atrial switch operations for D-transposition of the great arteries. In a retrospective series of patients with HLHS who completed Fontan procedure, patients who underwent a BT shunt or RV-PA conduit as stage I repair had significant ventricular dysfunction (17 and 31 percent, respectively) and atrioventricular valve regurgitation (40 and 16 percent, respectively) at a mean follow-up of 58 months following the Fontan procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2984801781\"><span class=\"h3\">Transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of congenital heart disease, when compared to patients with cardiomyopathy, experience greater morbidity and mortality when undergoing heart transplantation, possibly related to immune, clinical, and anatomical risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].
