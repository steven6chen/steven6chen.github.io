While there are differences in terminology and grading for these tumors arising at different sites, all commonly used classification systems reflect a basic separation between more indolent well-differentiated tumors (which in the digestive system have been traditionally referred to as carcinoid tumors [now termed gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)] or pancreatic islet cell tumors [pancreatic NETs]) and far more aggressive poorly differentiated types that behave clinically more like small cell carcinoma of the lung (termed neuroendocrine carcinomas).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, well-differentiated GEP-NETs generally have a much better prognosis. However, these tumors are not a homogeneous group, but instead display a spectrum of aggressiveness. Even in the presence of liver metastases, some patients may survive for many years. </p><p>Within the subgroup of well-differentiated NETs, morphology alone cannot predict tumor behavior. Proliferative rate, as assessed by mitotic count <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Ki67 labeling index, is of prognostic significance, independent of tumor stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The WHO classification separates well-differentiated GEP-NETs into low-grade (G1) and intermediate grade (G2) categories based upon proliferative rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All poorly differentiated NETs are high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine carcinomas according to this classification scheme. However, there is a small subset of tumors that displays high proliferative rate but well-differentiated morphology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H799311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Classification and terminology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H1612598\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'High-grade well-differentiated tumors and the 2017 WHO updated classification'</a>.)</p><p>GEP-NETs can also be defined by their functional, or hormone-secreting, status. Functioning NETs are characterized by the presence of clinical symptoms due to excess hormone secretion by the tumor. Functioning (hormone-secreting) pancreatic NETs are classified according to the predominant hormone they secrete and the resulting clinical syndrome (eg, insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, somatostatinoma). Functioning gastrointestinal NETs (ie, those associated with the carcinoid syndrome) are not classified differently than nonfunctioning tumors. Although functionality may impact prognosis (eg, insulinomas are generally indolent tumors), the biologic behavior of most functioning NETs is defined by the grade and stage of the tumor, just as it is in non-functioning tumors.

Some untreated patients with indolent tumors remain symptom-free for years, while others have symptomatic disease, either from tumor bulk or peptide hormone hypersecretion. Patients with functioning pancreatic NETs typically have symptoms caused by the specific type of hormone being produced by the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagonoma and the glucagonoma syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatostatinoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatostatinoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vipoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with metastatic gastrointestinal NETs, the secretion of serotonin and other vasoactive substances causes carcinoid syndrome, which is manifested by episodic flushing, wheezing, diarrhea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The carcinoid syndrome is most commonly seen with midgut carcinoid tumors (small intestine, appendix, proximal large bowel), almost exclusively in the setting of metastatic (usually liver) disease. It is rare with foregut (gastric, bronchial) and hindgut (distal colon, rectum, genitourinary) carcinoids. In addition, foregut NETs can be associated with an atypical variant of carcinoid syndrome. Patients with extraintestinal (eg, ovarian and bronchial) carcinoids can develop carcinoid syndrome in the absence of liver metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56015 \">table 2</a>).

A major factor impacting overall survival is primary tumor site. In an analysis of cases in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of NETs diagnosed between 2000 and 2012, the median survival for patients with distant metastases from grade 1 to 2 pancreatic NETs was 50 months. For patients with distant metastases from grade 1 to 2 small intestinal NETs, median survival was 103 months; in contrast, it was only 14 months for patients with colonic primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Another major prognostic factor is histologic grade, which is assigned based upon the mitotic rate or Ki-67 labeling index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, in the SEER database analysis, patients with a grade 1 or 2 appendiceal NET, or a grade 1 rectal NET had a median survival &gt;30 years. In contrast, patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma had poor overall survival irrespective of primary tumor site, ranging from 30 to 33 months for small intestine and appendix, respectively, to 8 months for cecum and colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Triphasic helical CT of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended to image metastatic carcinoid and pancreatic NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These tumors are highly vascular and may appear isodense with the liver during certain contrast phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52935\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52935 \">image 1</a>). They generally enhance most intensely with intravenous contrast during the early arterial phases of imaging, with washout during the delayed portal venous phase.

As a result of this greater sensitivity for liver metastases, some clinicians prefer MRI over CT. Consensus-based guidelines from the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) state that MRI should be considered superior to CT for the detection and follow-up of liver metastases from NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatostatin receptor-based imaging techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 90 percent of GEP-NETs, including non-functioning islet cell tumors (with the exception of insulinomas) and carcinoids, have high concentrations of somatostatin receptors and can be imaged using a radiolabeled form of the somatostatin analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (111-In pentetreotide).
