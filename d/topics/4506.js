Noninvasive ventilatory assistance is usually first needed at night but with progressive muscle dysfunction, patients become dependent on continuous full ventilator setting noninvasive ventilatory support (CNVS) and require the use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) to expulse airway secretions. Indeed, virtually all patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) caused by myopathic or lower motor neuron lesions can be managed noninvasively indefinitely whereas patients with central nervous system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper motor neuron lesions, such as those with bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), develop stridor and spastic upper airway collapse that can render MIE ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and necessitate tracheotomy for continued survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The use of CNVS will be reviewed here.

In addition, intubated patients and those dependent on up to continuous tracheostomy mechanical ventilation (CTMV) can be extubated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] or decannulated to CNVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic alveolar hypoventilation is the primary indication for ongoing nocturnal ventilatory assistance. Typical symptoms include fatigue, exertional dyspnea, reduced appetite, inattention, and impaired concentration and memory. Initially, hypoventilation occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and is manifest by oxyhemoglobin desaturation and hypercapnia. Hypoventilation subsequently extends throughout sleep and eventually into daytime hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

While the effect of limiting the application of NVS to nocturnal-only does not result in markedly prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], clinicians who understand and use up to continuous NVS (CNVS) report decades of prolonged survival for patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) and chest wall diseases. When the need for ventilatory support extends into daytime hours and is ultimately needed continuously, the properly equipped and informed patient can use it indefinitely as an alternative to tracheostomy ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114108\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114108 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The respiratory muscles can be aided by manually or mechanically applying forces to the body or delivering intermittent pressure to the airway.

Active ventilator circuits on portable ventilators that can be volume preset so that users can retain several consecutively delivered volumes for lung volume recruitment are preferred. As a result, volume and pressure preset <span class=\"nowrap\">assist/control</span> mode NVS without expiratory positive airway pressure is used. Intermittent mouthpiece NVS has been used in conjunction with nocturnal nasal NVS for up to 29 years of continuous noninvasive ventilatory support (CNVS) for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57248 \">picture 2</a>), 63 years for post-polio patients, 23 years for patients with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (spinal muscular atrophy type 1), and 38 years for high level spinal cord tetraplegia, as well as for other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p>In one center, 108 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy required CNVS including daytime mouthpiece NVS and nocturnal <span class=\"nowrap\">nasal/oronasal</span> NVS for a mean of nine years and up to 29 years.

The sac is cyclically inflated by air delivered from a portable positive pressure ventilator. Sac inflation compresses the abdomen, and the resulting movement of the abdominal contents elevates the diaphragm, forcing expiration to a volume less than functional residual capacity. With sac deflation, the diaphragm returns to its resting position and air enters the patient's upper airway. IAPV is only effective when the patient is in the sitting position. The patient can add to IAPV-provided volumes with spontaneous tidal volumes or by glossopharyngeal breathing.

There are both manual and mechanical methods to increase cough flows. &#160;</p><p>An effective cough involves a deep inspiration or assisted insufflation, followed by the creation of sufficient thoracoabdominal pressure to generate an explosive decompression and high expiratory flows. Although noninvasive inspiratory aids can provide deep insufflations by air stacking, expiratory muscle aids are required to optimize cough peak flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>For patients with vital capacities less than 1.5 liters, air stacking or a deep insufflation should precede cough. A manual resuscitator (eg, Ambu bag) or portable ventilator can be used to deliver volumes of air consecutively for air stacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Volumes are delivered to maximum lung inflation, that is, until the glottis can hold no additional air. Volume-cycled ventilators permit stacking of breaths to larger lung volumes to increase peak cough flows and are, therefore, preferred for assisted ventilation over pressure-cycling ventilators which do not permit breath stacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Manually assisted cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients with neuromuscular weakness are unable to generate adequate cough flow rates, air stacking to deep lung volumes is followed by applying forceful manual thrusts to the abdomen directed posterior and cephalad. This manually assisted coughing (also known as &quot;quad coughing&quot;) may be ineffective in the presence of severe scoliosis or severe impairment of bulbar-innervated muscles.</p><p>It should be used cautiously following meals due to the risk of aspiration. Abdominal thrusts should also not be used following abdominal trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective method for generating effective cough flows for clearing airway debris is the use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE). This can be used in combination with manually assisted coughing. When used via the upper airways MIE is used at positive and negative pressures of 50 to 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to insufflate then exsufflate the lungs. Following insufflation, the exsufflation to -50 cm H<sub>2</sub>O occurs in 0.02 seconds to generate about 10 L per second of expiratory flow. An abdominal thrust applied during the exsufflation phase may further increase these mechanically assisted cough flows (MAC). The goal is to fully inflate then fully empty the lungs in four to six seconds to clear airway debris while avoiding both hypo- and hyperventilation.</p><p>Although there is insufficient evidence to support routine use of MIE for well patients, mechanical insufflation can be used for lung volume recruitment whenever glottis strength is inadequate to hold consecutively delivered air volumes. MIE can also be employed whenever cough assistance is needed to clear excess airway mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When mucus plugs cause oxyhemoglobin desaturation, clearance of the secretions by MIE improves vital capacity and oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). In one study, a 55 percent increase in vital capacity (VC) was noted following MIE in congested patients with neuromuscular conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another study, MIE improved VC by 15 to 50 percent and normalized pulse SpO<sub>2</sub> in patients with neuromuscular disease who were in acute respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. When MIE is applied through translaryngeal or tracheostomy tubes it must be used at 60 to 70 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure because of the pressure drop off across the narrow gauge tubes. Its use via invasive tubes can eliminate the need for deep airway suctioning over which it is greatly preferred by patients and can return ambient air oxyhemoglobin saturation to normal in preparation for successful extubation or decannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. No serious complications have been reported to result from the use of MIE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Glossopharyngeal breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both inspiratory and, indirectly, expiratory muscle activity can be assisted by glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

If the patient develops respiratory distress when the fenestrated tube is capped, the problem may be that the airway around and through the fenestrated tube is not adequate. In this case, the tracheostomy tube is replaced with a smaller diameter tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any oro- or nasogastric tube that may be present is removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If nasal NVS is used, various nasal interfaces should be tried to optimize seal and comfort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63293\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63293 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52499 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/16,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25,26</a>]. Note that when used with an active ventilator circuit, one with an exhalation value, the exhalation ports of these interfaces must be covered or capped.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NVS may be required continuously (CNVS) but must be used without supplemental oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once criteria are met, the tracheostomy tube is removed. A temporary tracheostomy button can be placed in the tracheostomy opening to permit the patient to practice NVS without letting the ostomy close and without the partial airway obstruction that would be caused by practicing NVS with the continued presence of a tracheostomy tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular clearance of airway secretions by manually and mechanically assisted coughing via a mouthpiece or oronasal mask continues after decannulation of the trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a tracheostomy button is used, once an adequate nocturnal SpO<sub>2</sub> is documented during NVS in ambient air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the button is removed and the tracheostomy site allowed to close. An airtight dressing is applied over the site until it closes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Extubation to CNVS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient receiving mechanical ventilation via translaryngeal tube is unable to be weaned from ventilatory support, endotracheal tube removal and transition to full-time noninvasive aids, especially when delivered via a simple mouth piece, permit extubation without resort to tracheotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Upon extubation the patient uses mouthpiece NVS and takes fewer and fewer mouthpiece ventilations as tolerated. Patients usually wean back to their pre-intubation NVS regimen, often to nocturnal-only NVS provided that their VC exceeds 250 mL. Patients with lower VCs usually continue to require ongoing CNVS. No weaning schedule is imposed on the patient, and the anxiety inherent in the &quot;standard&quot; weaning approaches is avoided. Patients know that they can take assisted breaths anytime they feel the need, and can use feedback from pulse oximetry to guide ventilator use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/16,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, 155 of 157 intubated patients who refused tracheostomy and who failed spontaneous breathing trials both before and after extubation were extubated to full ventilator setting CNVS and mechanically assisted cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ninety-three had failed extubations and were transferred to a center specifically for extubation to CNVS. All &quot;unweanable&quot; patients with assisted cough peak flows over 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> were successfully extubated to CNVS on the first attempt whereas about 80 percent of extubation attempts were successful in patients with assisted cough peak flows of 0 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Deflation of the cuff</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cuff deflation is used to allow patients to talk while mechanically ventilated through a tracheostomy tube, to practice NVS, and to prevent complications from cuff pressure on the trachea. When deflating a cuff, the ventilator insufflation volume should be increased, often to 1500 mL or more, to compensate for air leakage through the upper airway. In general, the delivered volumes are increased until they generate the same airway pressures that were generated by the smaller delivered volumes before cuff deflation. The patient is encouraged to learn to control and use the insufflation &quot;leak&quot; of air across the vocal cords for effective speech. The leak also carries airway debris up to the mouth.</p><p>If the leak is inadequate for speech, a cuffless tube can be used or the tracheostomy tube downsized. Cuff removal, however, prevents optimal MIE for elimination of airway secretions. In contrast, a wider gauge tube should be placed if there is too much leakage for effective alveolar ventilation, as indicated by decreases in SpO<sub>2</sub>. In general, patients who can speak with deflated cuffs are strong candidates to have their tracheostomy tubes removed in favor of NVS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TRACHEOSTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No extent of inspiratory or expiratory muscle failure or ventilator dependence is in itself an indication for tracheostomy. The only indication for tracheostomy for patients with neuromuscular weakness is to prevent the aspiration of airway secretions that cause a drop in the SpO<sub>2</sub> to a level that cannot be maintained above 94 percent by noninvasive ventilatory support (NVS) and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE). Generally speaking, this only occurs for patients with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and severe bulbar impairment with stridor. As these patients approach the need for continuous NVS (CNVS), it is important to review with the patient what their goals and preferences are for ongoing medical care and ventilatory support. It is helpful to know what aspects of their underlying disease or associated medical interventions might lead them to want to limit therapy. These conversations may take place over several meetings and may include family members and significant others (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a>). It must be understood, however, that with over 1500 patients using NVS and over 800 dependent on CNVS we have never seen a patient refuse noninvasive management or prefer invasive (tracheostomy) management over noninvasive management.</p><p>CNVS dependent patients who require intubation for acute respiratory failure can usually be extubated back to CNVS once their lung disease has cleared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Avoidance of tracheostomy eliminates the risk of glottic and subglottic stenosis and other serious and potentially fatal complications of tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Long-term tracheostomy tube cuff inflation is also associated with the following problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased risk of trachiectasis and tracheal perforation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of effective verbalization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired elevation of the larynx and esophageal dysfunction during swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/13,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">PITFALLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;NIV&quot; for noninvasive ventilation has come to be synonymous with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and low spans of bi-level PAP. While the former is useless as a respiratory muscle aid, bi-level PAP assists lung ventilation as a function of the drive pressure (span) being used. In order to avoid endotracheal intubation, patients with severe hypoventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> very poor pulmonary compliance often need to use full ventilator setting volume or pressure preset ventilatory support (CNVS) which can be provided by delivering bi-level at spans over 18 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or by intermittent positive pressure ventilation without expiratory PAP or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Since the expiratory PAP is counterproductive for administering ventilatory assistance, intermittent positive pressure ventilation without expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) or PEEP, whether volume or preset, is preferred for these patients. Full-setting CNVS normalizes alveolar ventilation, more fully rests inspiratory muscles, optimizes lung volume recruitment, and augments cough flows.</p><p>Frequently, patients who are able to walk (ie, myotonic dystrophy or kyphoscoliosis) do not use noninvasive ventilatory support (NVS) sufficiently during daytime hours or even for sleep to normalize alveolar ventilation. These patients often have repeated respiratory complications until they spend most of their time in wheelchairs from which they can more conveniently use mouthpiece NVS and CNVS.</p><p>The clinician is often tempted to prescribe oxygen therapy. However, if arterial blood gases can be normalized by NVS and manually assisted coughing, then oxygen therapy is not needed and can be hazardous. When oxygen supplementation is used along with NVS, it decreases the efficiency of nocturnal NVS, increases the risk of pulmonary complications, and exacerbates hypercapnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In general, supplemental oxygen should not be used at home for patients except for patients with advanced ALS and bulbar impairment who need, but refuse, tracheotomy for secretion management and ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the same general interventions and cautions for patients with primary lung disease are also applicable to patients with neuromuscular disease. Patients are cautioned to avoid extremes of temperature, humidity, fatigue, crowded areas, or exposure to respiratory tract pathogens, sedatives, supplemental oxygen, and opiates. Patients should be advised to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. They should also be instructed about using respiratory muscle aids in the event of an upper respiratory tract infection or the need for surgical intervention. Diaphragm pacing is ineffective and possibly harmful for patients with all neuromuscular diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heavy meals should be avoided and obesity prevented or managed. General weight charts are not applicable to these patients. However, a specific weight chart has been developed for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Musculotendinous releases and physical and occupational therapy are useful to maintain orthopedic status and function. In addition, preventing back deformity can permit the use of the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator and prevent the untoward effects of back deformity on cardiopulmonary and physical functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence that exercise improves pulmonary function or prognosis in patients with neuromuscular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Activities of daily living can be greatly facilitated by use of a wheelchair, adaptive equipment, and energy conservation. There are a multitude of orthoses including robotic manipulators and other assistance devices for helping the patient with dressing, grooming, personal hygiene, transfers, wheelchair mobility, and possibly ambulation. Environmental control systems can permit the severely disabled individual to have access to the telephone and all electrical appliances. Robot arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], including the JACO, specifically assist with feeding and other upper limb activities of daily living from motorized wheelchairs and are operated using motorized wheelchair controls so anyone who can operate a motorized wheelchair can operate the robot arm. Commercial robot arms are programmable, lightweight, and easy to mount on the wheelchair and manipulate.</p><p>For many patients, an efficient bowel and bladder management program greatly facilitates the activities of daily living. Constipation, associated with increased gastrointestinal transit time, is common. High fluid intake should be encouraged.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most useful single technique for facilitating a bowel movement is using a lift, so that the patient's hips are flexed and the buttocks are in a dependent position over a commode.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When alveolar hypoventilation extends into the daytime hours, daytime use of noninvasive respiratory muscle aids can avert invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient selection criteria that define which patients are candidates for noninvasive ventilatory assistance is discussed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most useful daytime inspiratory aid is mouthpiece noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NVS). Mouthpiece NVS delivers positive pressure via a 15 mL angled mouthpiece that is kept adjacent to the mouth for easy access to assisted breaths. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have neck rotation or lip strength that is inadequate for grabbing a mouthpiece, NVS or the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator (IAPV) can be used during daytime hours. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to generate sufficient expiratory flow for effective coughing is the most important factor permitting the long-term use of noninvasive ventilation. When neuromuscular disease causes an ineffective cough, insufflation to increase lung recoil combined with exsufflation and abdominal thrusts can make cough flows more effective as can the use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cough assistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) is needed to assure adequacy of cough and ventilation, especially during upper respiratory infections. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Practical aspects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disease who undergo tracheostomy for mechanical ventilation during a respiratory tract infection, are candidates for NVS and removal of the tracheostomy tube, if the criteria in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64672\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64672 \">table 2</a>) are fulfilled. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tracheostomy to noninvasive ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only indication for tracheostomy for patients with neuromuscular weakness is to prevent the aspiration of airway secretions that cause a drop in the SpO<sub>2</sub> to a level that cannot be maintained above 94 percent by NVS and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) specifically because MIE becomes ineffective to clear airway secretions due to decrease of upper airway patency from hypertonicity (stridor).
