Adequate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients during pregnancy promotes these processes, while undernutrition and overnutrition can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, monitor, and, when appropriate, make changes to improve maternal nutrition both before and during pregnancy.</p><p>The effects of inadequate or excessive intake of certain nutrients can be observed in the short-term, but possibly also in the long-term. Both fetal undernutrition and overnutrition, including development in an obesogenic environment, can lead to permanent changes of fetal metabolic pathways and thereby increase the risk of childhood and adult diseases related to these pathways. The developmental model for the origins of disease (ie, Barker Hypothesis) hypothesizes that the fetal environment causes epigenetic modifications that impact gene expression and thereby influence development of disease in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Seminal studies of the health status of adult offspring of a cohort of women who were pregnant during the Dutch famine in World War II support this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Many questions remain unanswered due to the many challenges of performing high-quality research in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These challenges include the often unknown critical windows when nutrition may impact development, the many physiologic changes that occur over the course of normal pregnancy, the large individual differences in maternal adaptation to pregnancy, ethical and practical issues of experimenting with human pregnancy, challenges with determining effects of specific nutrients in the context of a whole diet, and the lack of a good animal model that can be directly extrapolated to humans.</p><p>This topic will discuss basic nutritional concerns related to normal pregnancy, primarily for women living in developed countries. Nutritional therapy of diabetes in pregnant women, in-depth information on specific topics related to maternal nutrition, and basic nutritional issues in healthy nonpregnant adults are reviewed elsewhere.

Nutritional assessment and counseling should continue across pregnancy and during lactation. Where available, these activities are best performed using a team approach, which may include the obstetric provider, health professionals trained in prenatal nutrition counseling and education, and a registered dietitian with perinatal nutritional expertise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical and surgical</strong> &ndash; The medical history can help uncover behaviors and medical conditions that pose nutrition-related health risks for the woman and her fetus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107824 \">table 1</a>). For example, use of cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drugs poses direct health risks and also affects intake of an adequate and balanced diet, while stimulants may increase energy requirements. Patients sometimes forget to disclose that they had bariatric surgery, especially if it was in the distant past. Sequelae of bariatric surgery (eg, micronutrient deficiencies, dumping syndrome) can affect pregnancy management and outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility and pregnancy after bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstetric</strong> &ndash; The past obstetric history can impact future pregnancies.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Previously affected pregnancy or history of NTD in either parent'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dietary</strong> &ndash; Asking the patient to complete a self-administered questionnaire is helpful for reviewing her typical diet and identifying obvious deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53845\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef53845 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is important to follow-up with specific questions about responses that suggest a possible nutritional issue. Examples of potential problems include skipping meals; limiting food; being on a special diet; consuming sweetened beverages; low frequency of consuming calcium foods, vegetables, or fruits; and high intake of foods with added <span class=\"nowrap\">sugars/fats</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A brief screening questionnaire may be more user-friendly for health professionals in busy practices who are not specifically trained in nutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107808 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This questionnaire has been adapted to assess healthy eating in pregnant women and provides simple tips to improve diet quality. Although this version of the questionnaire has not been validated, a more general version has been validated for assessing diet-related chronic disease risk and has been used successfully in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who routinely eat three meals daily that include several servings of a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and a few sources of protein (eg, meat,&nbsp;poultry, seafood, beans, peas, eggs, processed&nbsp;soy&nbsp;products, nuts, seeds) are likely to meet the Daily Recommended Intakes for most nutrients. However, even nutrient-dense food choices and diets, such as those in the United States Department of Agriculture food patterns, may not meet nutrient goals for iron, vitamin D, and choline during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination centers on measurements of height and weight to calculate the body mass index (BMI) and assess whether the woman is at a healthy weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63600%7EENDO%2F74762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63600 graphicRef74762 \">table 3A-B</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). The woman should be asked what she weighed at her last menstrual period (prepregnancy weight) and this weight should be used for baseline calculations. A prepregnancy BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is normal for Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black individuals; however, for Asians, the upper limit of normal is BMI &lt;23 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Supplements often specify the type of vitamin D they contain. D3 is more readily converted to active forms of vitamin D and is more effective at increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D; thus, it is often preferred over D2. Most prescription prenatal vitamins contain cholecalciferol (D3), but some contain ergocalciferol (D2) and some contain a mixture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The value of routine vitamin D supplementation above the RDA in pregnancy is an active and controversial area of investigation, but there is no clear evidence of a reduction in adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, preeclampsia, stillbirth) or adverse offspring outcomes (eg, neonatal death, asthma, low bone mineral content). In a 2016 Cochrane review including data from seven small trials, pregnant women who received daily vitamin D supplementation had higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than those receiving placebo, but the response was heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Two of the seven studies found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia, low birth weight, and preterm birth; however, when vitamin D supplementation was combined with calcium supplementation, risk of preterm birth increased.

Providers who monitor gestational weight gain have key opportunities to provide information and tools to help women. In a 2014 systematic review of 25 studies in developed countries, women reported that they received inadequate nutrition information from healthcare professionals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Importantly, the same review found that women who received nutrition information from their healthcare professionals were more likely to comply with advice when it was specific and explanations were provided for the recommendations. Furthermore, women were more likely to take prenatal supplements if it was verbally recommended by their provider and they received ongoing counseling at subsequent visits. Thus, healthcare professionals have the potential to impact the nutritional status of pregnant women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H397785545\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling about healthy eating during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are pregnant should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables as well as whole grains, low-fat dairy, and a variety of proteins. The exact amount of foods from each food group (ranges provided blow) needed by a woman depends on her prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), activity level, age, and trimester. It is important for pregnant women to choose foods that are nutrient-dense (foods that contain high levels of important nutrients compared with the amount of calories, such as fruits and vegetables, <span class=\"nowrap\">nuts/nut</span> butters, yogurt) to meet the higher nutrient requirements in pregnancy without exceeding caloric needs. Women should also avoid foods with empty calories (foods that are high in added sugars and solid fats, such as soda, desserts, fried foods, whole-fat dairy, and high-fat meats) because they provide little nutritional value beyond calories.</p><p>Use of a nutrition screening tool can help health professionals identify pregnant women who may be at risk for lower quality diets. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p>In the first trimester of pregnancy, women typically do not need to increase their caloric intake. In the second and third trimesters, most women will need to increase their caloric consumption to promote appropriate weight gain. However, the old adage &quot;eating for two&quot; neither accurately nor appropriately depicts the increased needs of pregnant women. On average, women need only approximately 340 and 450 additional <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> in the second and third trimesters, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Most pregnant women in the latter two trimesters will require between 2200 and 2900 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although calorie needs can vary widely, and this should be assessed individually.

These diets vary considerably, as do omnivorous diets. The nutritional adequacy of a vegetarian diet must be judged individually, not on the basis of what it is called, but on the type, amount, and variety of nutrients that are consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>Vegetarian diets that are well-balanced are similar to well-balanced omnivore diets in that they meet most nutrient goals except for iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, and choline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/13,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,94</a>]. Additional potential nutrients of concern, particularly for vegans, are calcium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>, and essential n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexanoic acid [DHA]).

According to the strictest definition, a vegan vegetarian diet consists primarily of cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts; animal foods, including milk, dairy products, and eggs generally are excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. Several less restrictive vegetarian diets may include animal flesh, eggs, or milk and dairy products. Vegetarian diets frequently are grouped as follows (ordered from less restricted to more restricted):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semi-vegetarian &ndash; People who consume meat, fish or chicken in their diet on occasion.

Vegetables classified botanically as fruits (avocado, tomatoes) are commonly included in fruitarian diets; all other vegetables, grains, beans and animal products are excluded.</p><p/><p>Limited research in populations outside of the United States showed that the macronutrient intake of pregnant vegetarians was similar to that of pregnant non-vegetarians except pregnant vegetarians consumed statistically lower amounts of protein and higher amounts of carbohydrate than pregnant non-vegetarians; however, none of the studies reported protein deficiency in pregnant vegetarians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Protein quality in well-balanced vegetarian diets need not be a concern. Although individual plant sources of protein tend to be incomplete in their provision of all essential amino acids, eating a variety of types of plant protein sources (grains, legumes, nuts) over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Protein consumption in the United States tends to be significantly higher than in other parts of the world. In some Asian cultures, animal protein sources may be consumed only once or twice a week. Although these individuals would not label themselves as vegetarian, in American research studies they would be categorized as semi-vegetarian.</p><p>Phytoestrogen consumption tends to be higher among vegetarians than among omnivores. Concerns have been raised regarding phytoestrogen intake and reproductive development. Studies in animal models have reported conflicting effects of prenatal exposure to phytoestrogens (primarily genistein) with both beneficial and adverse effects depending on timing of exposure, dose, and outcomes examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Most of the research in humans, however, has investigated the effects of postnatal exposure of phytoestrogens through soy-based formulas on later reproductive health. More research in humans is needed that examines the effects of high-level exposure to phytoestrogens prenatally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8247565\"><span class=\"h3\">Food avoidance to prevent atopic disease in offspring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both avoidance and ingestion of specific antigens, such as peanuts, milk, and eggs, during pregnancy have been hypothesized to reduce the frequency of atopic disease in offspring, but the bulk of evidence does not support either approach.

Elimination of gluten-rich foods during pregnancy could result in inadequate intakes of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and iron; however, substitution of other whole grain foods should prevent any nutritional deficiency and these diets are generally considered safe.</p><p>Women with celiac disease benefit from a gluten-free diet. In a systematic review of case-control and cohort studies, women with untreated celiac disease were at increased risk of reproductive failure compared with women in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

Average use of artificial sweeteners is usually below this limit. For example, the ADI for aspartame is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day;</span> Diet Coke contains 131 mg aspartame per 355 mL can and one packet of Equal contains 33 mg of aspartame.

One study reported an increased risk of bladder cancer in offspring of pregnant rats that consumed very high doses of saccharin; however, the only other study of this issue did not show an increased risk. Since there are alternatives to using saccharin, avoiding it in pregnancy is prudent.</p><p>A task force of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Nutrition concluded that aspartame is safe for both the pregnant mother and developing baby. In addition, the FDA and the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association concluded that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding can safely use aspartame [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Although methanol is a breakdown product of aspartame, methanol is also produced as a breakdown product of many fruits; the levels produced from either of these sources are very low and considered safe in pregnancy.</p><p>Some observational studies suggest that chronic consumption of artificial sweeteners may increase the risk of obesity and metabolic diseases in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]; however, results have been conflicting and no intervention trials have been conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-in-pregnancy/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].

The effect was primarily seen in male infants and was not explained by maternal body mass index, diet quality, total energy intake, other obesity risk factors, or breastfeeding duration, and there were no comparable associations for sugar-sweetened beverages.&nbsp;Further study is warranted, ideally a randomized trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3402923865\"><span class=\"h3\">Sugar-sweetened beverages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women should be advised to avoid or limit sugar-sweetened beverages for the health of both the mother and her child.</p><p>More than occasional intake of sugar-sweetened beverages is generally discouraged in all populations because these drinks tend to be high in calories and low in nutritive value.

DHA is necessary for normal development of the brain and retina. The body's ability to produce sufficient DHA for optimal health and development is probably inadequate; therefore, consumption of preformed n-3 LCPUFA, such as in fish, is recommended.

Well-nourished women may not need multiple-micronutrient supplements, but in the absence of careful evaluation by a nutritionist, it is prudent to recommend them. At a minimum, the daily multiple-micronutrient supplement should contain key <span class=\"nowrap\">vitamins/minerals</span> that are often not met by diet alone, such as (see <a href=\"#H717784077\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrients'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Iron &ndash; 27 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Folate &ndash; at least 0.4 mg (0.6 mg in the second and third trimesters)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcium &ndash; at least 250 mg (elemental calcium 1000 mg per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Iodine &ndash; 150 mcg (preferably in the form of potassium iodide)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vitamin D &ndash; 200 to 600 international units (exact amount is controversial)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preconceptionally and during the first trimester, women should take a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplement of 0.4 to 0.8 mg per day. Higher doses (4 mg per day) are recommended for women known to be at increased risk for offspring with neural tube defects (eg, history of a previously affected infant, maternal use of some anticonvulsant medications). (See <a href=\"#H717782123\" class=\"local\">'Folic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive intake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> (greater than 10,000 international units per day) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> iodine can have harmful fetal effects. (See <a href=\"#H29003695\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects from excessive supplementation and dietary intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women should be counseled to eat a healthy diet during pregnancy. This includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and a variety of proteins. Nutrient-dense foods should be encouraged, and empty calories should be minimized or avoided. These eating patterns will help women meet nutrient needs without exceeding calorie needs. &quot;Eating for two&quot; during pregnancy is a misnomer, as women require no additional calories during the first trimester and only a moderate increase in calories (additional 340 to 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day)</span> in the second and third trimesters. Exact needs vary among women based on age, prepregnancy weight, height, and activity level. Tools are available to help clinicians counsel women and for women to monitor their own nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H397785545\" class=\"local\">'Counseling about healthy eating during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-imposed dietary restraints can be problematic if essential nutrients are left out of the diet or weight gain is inadequate. However, certain foods should be limited or avoided during pregnancy because of potentially toxic effects. These include consumption of some types of fish, high caffeine intake, unwashed <span class=\"nowrap\">fruits/vegetables,</span> unpasteurized dairy products, herbal products, liver-based foods, and undercooked meats. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Counseling women about nutrition in pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be educated about the risk for and prevention of foodborne infections. (See <a href=\"#H128748361\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of foodborne infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women should limit seafood consumption to 12 oz of cooked seafood (about three 4 oz servings) per week, and completely avoid some types of seafood to minimize fetal exposure to mercury and other water-borne contaminants. Specific recommendations are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111607 \">table 9</a>).
