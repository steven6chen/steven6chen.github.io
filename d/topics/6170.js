It also noted that a majority of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were not detected in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Despite these limitations, surveys of worldwide drug resistance indicate that drug-resistant TB is a large and increasing problem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83859\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83859 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83860\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83860 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In 2017, the WHO estimated that there were roughly 601,000 cases of incident MDR-TB worldwide (CI 350,000 to 610,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; of these, only about 156,000 were detected, notified, and received treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. MDR-TB occurs worldwide; China, India, Russia, and the countries of the former Soviet Union are estimated to carry the highest number of MDR-TB cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/7,8,10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10-18</a>]. Of patients who received treatment, overall outcomes were poor; about 52 percent of patients were considered cured. As improved diagnostic testing becomes available, MDR-TB will likely be recognized as the major threat to global tuberculosis control over the next several decades</p><p>Many MDR cases are reported in individuals who have not received prior treatment, although a history of prior treatment (especially if incomplete or unsupervised) is probably the greatest single risk factor for the presence of MDR-TB in a given patient. The presence of initial drug resistance substantially reduces treatment outcomes, since in general most TB treatment approaches rely on standardized rather than tailored treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In one study including data from 103 countries where standardized regimens are used, failure and relapse rates were significantly higher in regions where the initial multidrug-resistance prevalence was &ge;3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In these areas, retreatment was required in more than 20 percent of cases. High rates of MDR-TB among patients requiring retreatment have also been described; in one survey from the Philippines, MDR-TB was observed 76 percent of retreatment cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A 2008 survey noted that, among new TB cases in 72 countries, primary resistance to at least one drug ranged from 0 percent (Iceland) to 56 percent (Azerbaijan) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among previously treated TB cases in 66 countries, resistance to at least one drug ranged from 0 percent (in three European countries) to 86 percent (Uzbekistan). The locales with the highest rates of MDR-TB were Tashkent, Uzbekistan (60 percent), and Baku, Azerbaijan (56 percent). Rates of MDR-TB are increasing in Peru, the Republic of Korea, and parts of the former Soviet Union (Orel and Tomsk). Only six countries in Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Rwanda, Senegal, and the United Republic of Tanzania) provided survey data; rates of MDR-TB ranged from 0.7 percent in Madagascar to 3.9 percent in Rwanda.</p><p>Some resistance data for other countries in Africa have been reported. In Botswana, the rate of drug resistance is increasing, despite implementation of 100 percent coverage of directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) strategy in 1986. In a 2002 survey of drug resistance among isolates from 1182 patients with newly diagnosed TB, rates of monoresistance and MDR-TB were 10.4 and 0.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among 106 patients previously treated for TB, the respective rates were 22.8 and 10.4 percent. In Uganda, the burden of drug resistance in previously treated patients with TB is also sizeable. Among 410 patients enrolled between 2003 and 2006, the prevalence of MDR-TB was 12.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A survey of resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> and quinolones in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe found varying rates of resistance across these regions; resistance was quite high in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The outcome of DOTS with a standard four-drug regimen was evaluated by the WHO retrospectively in six geographically distinct countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The prevalence of drug-resistant TB in the United State decreased between 1991 and 2006 (3.5 to 1.1 percent) and remained stable between 2005 and 2006 (1.2 percent), even as drug-resistant disease increased worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. About 20 percent of drug-resistant TB cases in the United States can be linked to domestic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Adherence to hospital infection control measures, the widespread use of an initial four-drug chemotherapy regimen, and directly observed therapy are critical for controlling the incidence rates of drug-resistant TB in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/29,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31-33</a>].</p><p>Single-drug resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> (the most common type of drug resistance in the United States) occurred in approximately 9 percent of cases with positive cultures in 2013, a slight increase from 7.7 percent of cases in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Most of these are previously untreated cases. The overall rate has remained essentially stable since 1995 but is variable by region; rates of isoniazid resistance ranged from 0 percent in some states to 34 percent (15 of 44 culture positive) in Wisconsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Multidrug resistance has decreased overall between 1993 and 2015 (484 MDR cases in 1993 [2.4 percent] to 89 cases in 2015 [1.2 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. MDR-TB disproportionately affects foreign-born individuals; this group accounted for 85 percent of cases of MDR-TB in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. MDR-TB cases accounted for 0.4 percent of cases occurring in individuals born in the United States and 1.3 percent of individuals born outside the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>An exception to the general decrease in the prevalence of MDR-TB in the United States has been in Massachusetts, where there was a rise in MDR cases in 2013; 7 of 149 case isolates (4.7 percent) that had undergone drug susceptibility testing were MDR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. All patients were foreign born.</p><p>Migration of individuals with TB can alter the prevalence and resistance patterns. Among 10,000 Hmong refugees resettled from Thailand into the United States from June 2004 through January 2005, 37 were found to have active TB, including 4 with MDR-TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among the 6000 refugees still awaiting emigration from Thailand, TB was identified in 6 percent of individuals; of these, MDR-TB was observed in 6 percent of cases, half of which were smear negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. As a result, enhanced screening for all immigrants and refugees entering the United States was implemented by the Centers for Disease Control, beginning with high-priority countries as determined by TB prevalence and immigration patterns.</p><p>At the peak of the HIV epidemic in the United States, HIV infection was associated with MDR-TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Subsequently, a 2007 review of published studies and surveillance data noted that MDR-TB does not appear to cause infection or disease in HIV-infected individuals more readily than drug-susceptible strains, although HIV infection and MDR-TB may converge in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is discussed in detail separately.

Such resistance occurs by spontaneous mutation within the organism&rsquo;s genome as they replicate. Selection for these resistant organisms will occur if only one drug is used in treatment, since approximately 1 in 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> organisms exhibits intrinsic resistance to any given drug. The chance that an organism in a population is resistant to two drugs is roughly 1 in 10<sup>14</sup>, making resistance much less likely to emerge with combination therapy.

MDR cases in the United States are uncommon; development of MDR-TB in the United States reflects poor physician prescribing practices, poorly supervised treatment programs, and poor infection control programs in hospitals and prisons.</p><p>The global burden of MDR-TB is large. The global HIV epidemic has fueled spread of MDR-TB by creating a large reservoir of immunosuppressed persons who are more likely to develop active, communicable disease following infection. In general, the acquisition of drug resistance is thought to come at a cost of overall fitness; MDR strains are not thought to be more virulent or transmissible. However, one molecular epidemiology study from China reported that MDR strains were more transmissible than drug-susceptible strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The risk of infection with drug-resistant strains may be amplified in regions where there is reduced cross-immunity between originating strain groups. However, epidemiologic studies and TB vaccine trials indicate that cross-protective immunity to TB can be conferred by infection within the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex (eg, by <em>M. bovis</em>, <em>M. microti</em>) as well as by infection within the entire genus (eg, by nontuberculous mycobacteria), suggesting that antigens common to all organisms within the genus may play a dominant role in immune protection against human TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nosocomial transmission and HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several nosocomial outbreaks of MDR-TB have been reported, primarily from hospitals and prisons in New York and New Jersey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].
