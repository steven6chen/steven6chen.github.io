Osteoarthritis (OA) associated with BCP crystals is the most common form of arthritis associated with these crystals, and Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS) is a characteristic syndrome in which BCP crystals play a prominent role. The predominant mineral type in BCP-associated musculoskeletal pathology is carbonated hydroxyapatite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-arthritis-including-milwaukee-shoulder-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of BCP-associated arthritis will be presented here.

These include partially carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate (whitlockite). The terms &quot;calcium phosphate&quot; and &quot;hydroxyapatite&quot; are often used synonymously with the more accurate term &quot;basic calcium phosphate.&quot; BCP crystals are similar in composition to both the normal mineral found in bones and teeth and the pathologic mineral found in atherosclerotic plaques and calcinosis cutis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3082558393\"><span class=\"h2\">BCP-associated arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraarticular BCP crystals have been recognized since the 1970s, initially in the synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and subsequently in other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-arthritis-including-milwaukee-shoulder-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. A subset of patients with a unique clinical presentation of noninflammatory, shoulder-predominant, OA-like arthritis associated with BCP crystals has been termed Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS), although OA is the clinical syndrome that remains most closely linked with intraarticular BCP crystals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-arthritis-including-milwaukee-shoulder-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>OA with BCP crystals and MSS likely represent points on the same spectrum of disease pathogenesis rather than different syndromes. In addition to these conditions, there are case reports of BCP-associated arthritis in patients with autoimmune inflammatory processes and in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p><p>Other common BCP-associated musculoskeletal syndromes are BCP-associated calcific periarthritis and calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder, which are described in detail elsewhere.

BCP mineral formation often occurs at sites of local tissue damage associated with injury or inflammation. Once formed, BCP crystals can produce symptoms and mediate tissue damage by several mechanisms, including the induction of a vigorous inflammatory response, biomechanical disruption, and by direct interactions with connective tissue cells, producing destructive cytokines and prostaglandins in the absence of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-arthritis-including-milwaukee-shoulder-syndrome/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>Severe radiographic damage and the presence of articular calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals are risk factors for BCP crystals in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). A history of shoulder trauma or heavy use, along with increased age, are associated with Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS).

Approximately one-third of these patients described some trauma to the affected shoulder, while others had occupations involving heavy use of the shoulders or a history of crutch walking <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheelchair use. Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease has some clinical overlap with MSS, but whether these patients are clinically different from those with BCP crystals alone is not known.</p><p>The absence of widely available clinical tests to accurately detect articular BCP crystals has slowed progress in understanding their roles in OA and other settings in which they occur, and relatively little is known about the factors that specifically initiate symptomatic arthritis associated with the crystals.

These patients have subacute or chronic pain in one of more large joints, which is worse with activity, increases as the day progresses, and is not associated with prolonged (&gt;30 minutes) morning stiffness. The presence of intraarticular BCP crystals may be suspected when there is an unusually rapid pace of progression or very aggressive joint and soft tissue destruction.

The diagnosis is further supported by synovial fluid aspirates showing cell counts of &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and no MSU or CPP crystals. Radiographs can provide additional validation by demonstrating large effusions, massive rotator cuff damage, and extensive cartilage loss and bony changes.</p><p/><p>These diagnoses can be further supported by the identification of BCP crystals with alizarin red S staining of synovial fluid, if sufficient expertise in such staining and appropriate reagents are available (see <a href=\"#H2626888769\" class=\"local\">'Alizarin red S'</a> below). This would be most helpful in patients with unusually aggressive or rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (OA), particularly in the shoulder. Ideally, analytic techniques to identify the chemical composition of crystals, such as spectroscopy or x-ray diffraction, could be employed to confirm the diagnosis, but these techniques are generally not available in routine clinical practice.

Other measures may also be effective to identify BCP crystals. Some clinical laboratories are willing to analyze particulates from synovial fluid with equipment used to identify kidney stone composition. In addition, methods to detect BCP crystals based upon radioactive bisphosphate-binding or calcium-binding fluorescent dyes, with or without flow cytometry, have been described but have not been validated for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-calcium-phosphate-bcp-crystal-arthritis-including-milwaukee-shoulder-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2113239943\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) with basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals and Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS) includes posttraumatic or postinflammatory OA, calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, and gout, as well as other less common syndromes causing joint pain and dysfunction, often without a prominent inflammatory component.

Differences in the acuity of presentation and the degree of inflammation may help differentiate between these syndromes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MSS usually presents with symptoms and signs that evolve over months or years, while acute CPP crystal arthritis and gout more often present with rapid onset of symptoms. Synovial fluid analysis in acute gout and acute CPP crystal arthritis demonstrates inflammatory cell counts, while cell counts in joints from patients with MSS are in the noninflammatory range. More chronic presentations of CPPD involving the shoulder may be more difficult to differentiate from MSS, and a careful search for synovial fluid CPP crystals would be needed to distinguish between these two syndromes.

Once formed, BCP crystals can produce symptoms and mediate tissue damage by induction of an inflammatory response, biomechanical disruption, and by inducing the local production of destructive cytokines and prostaglandins in the absence of inflammation.

BCP crystal arthritis can also occur in a subset of patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, in patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, and in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
