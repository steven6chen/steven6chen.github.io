Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, chronic airway inflammation, mediated by a variety of immune cells and mediators, results in the development of clinically recognizable asthma.

The recognition that chronic inflammatory changes begin at the onset of asthma symptoms has resulted in increasing use of anti-inflammatory therapy. In fact, the mainstays of treatment for all forms of persistent asthma are the inhaled glucocorticoids (also called inhaled corticosteroids). Research into the chronic inflammation of asthma is ongoing. The results hold promise in identifying new therapeutic targets for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-epidemiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Multiple cytokines, including leukotrienes, have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with asthma. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are also linked to progression of lung disease.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increased frequency of asthma, including improved hygiene and increased indoor air pollution. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of epidemiologic factors are associated with an increased risk of developing asthma, including gender, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> socioeconomic status, and locale. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiologic risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of asthma are due to airflow obstruction resulting from the cumulative effects of smooth muscle constriction around airways, airway wall edema, intraluminal mucus accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration of the submucosa, and basement membrane thickening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74177\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74177 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physiologic consequences of asthma are a reduction in airway luminal diameter. The three defining components of asthmatic airflow obstruction are airway inflammation, reversible bronchoconstriction, and increased airways hyperresponsiveness to a variety of stimuli.
