In the vast majority of cases, it is caused by thyroid disease (primary hypothyroidism). Much less often it is caused by decreased secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland or by decreased secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67769\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67769 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The cause of hypothyroidism should be identified in every patient for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism may be transient and require no or only short-term therapy, as in patients with painless thyroiditis or postpartum thyroiditis.

The diagnostic approach to and treatment of hypothyroidism are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with hypothyroidism caused by disease of the thyroid gland, decreased secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) leads to a reduction in the serum concentrations of the two hormones, which results in a compensatory increase in TSH secretion. Thus, the combination of a low serum T4 and a high serum TSH concentration both confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and indicates that it is due to primary thyroid disease.</p><p>We recognize two forms of primary hypothyroidism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical hypothyroidism &ndash; Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a high serum TSH concentration in the presence of normal serum free T4 and T3 concentrations. This combination of findings reflects the great sensitivity of TSH secretion to very small reductions in thyroid secretion. These patients have few, if any, symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overt hypothyroidism &ndash; Overt hypothyroidism is defined as a high serum TSH concentration in the presence of a low serum free T4 concentration. Most of these patients have symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>All of the thyroid disorders considered below can cause either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas of the world is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, which is caused by cell- and antibody-mediated destruction of thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The disorder has two forms: goitrous and atrophic. They differ in the extent of lymphocytic infiltration, fibrosis, and thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland but not in their pathophysiology.</p><p>Both cellular and humoral factors may contribute to the thyroid injury and hypothyroidism in chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Cytotoxic T cells may directly destroy thyroid cells. In addition, more than 90 percent of patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have high serum concentrations of autoantibodies to thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase (thyroid microsomal antigen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], or the thyroid <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/I</span> transporter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76522\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76522 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These antibodies have little, if any, functional activity. Many patients also have antibodies that block the action of TSH on the TSH receptor or that are cytotoxic to thyroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum antithyroid antibodies need <strong>not</strong> be measured routinely in patients with overt primary hypothyroidism, because almost all have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. However, a test for antithyroid peroxidase antibodies may be useful to predict the likelihood of progression to permanent overt hypothyroidism in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or those with painless (silent) thyroiditis or postpartum thyroiditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In community surveys, high serum antithyroid peroxidase antibody concentrations are found in approximately 5 percent of adults and approximately 15 percent of older women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76522\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76522 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism is similar and that of overt hypothyroidism varies from 0.1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one population-based study, the overall incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis was 46.4 per 1000 subjects during a 20-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Hypothyroidism is much (five to eight times) more common in women than men. The majority of those who are hypothyroid have a goiter, but not all who have a goiter and circulating antithyroid antibodies have hypothyroidism.</p><p>In the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 13,344 people without known thyroid disease had measurements of serum TSH, T4, thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism was found in 4.6 percent (0.3 percent overt and 4.3 percent subclinical).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism was found in 1.3 percent (0.5 percent overt and 0.7 percent subclinical).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum thyroglobulin antibody concentrations were high in 10 percent and serum thyroid peroxidase antibody concentrations were high in 11 percent. The latter were associated with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, while the former were not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean serum TSH concentrations were significantly lower in blacks (1.7 percent) than in whites or Mexican Americans.</p><p/><p>Thus, a significant proportion of the United States population has laboratory evidence of thyroid disease, suggesting that routine screening would be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual course of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function. Among patients with this disorder who have mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism, exhibited as slight increases in TSH and the presence of thyroid antibodies, overt hypothyroidism occurs at a rate of approximately 5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is usually, but not always, permanent. Repeat biopsies reveal little histologic change, nor do serum antithyroid antibody concentrations change in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a few patients have remissions and no longer need T4 therapy, indicating that the hypothyroidism is not always caused by destruction of the thyroid gland. One study, as an example, evaluated 15 Japanese patients with TSH-receptor blocking antibodies in whom the antibodies later disappeared; six remained euthyroid for several years after T4 therapy was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Whether disappearance of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies can be used to predict remission of hypothyroidism is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Susceptibility and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is more common in women, especially older women. Whether the increase in risk in the latter group is due to estrogen deficiency or age is not known. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is also the most common cause of hypothyroidism in children, being reported as early as one and two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with several polymorphisms in the genes for human leukocyte antigen (HLA), T-cell antigen receptors, and other immunomodulatory molecules, suggesting a role for genetic susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, the relative risk is approximately two for most of the associations, which also vary considerably among different racial and ethnic groups. Turner syndrome and Down syndrome are both associated with a higher than expected rate of autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whatever the factors mediating genetic susceptibility, patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis are more likely to have a personal or family history of other autoimmune diseases, such as adrenal insufficiency and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is one of the components of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome 2.

It is most often characterized by a subacute onset of confusion, with altered level of consciousness, seizures, and myoclonus. In contrast to the cognitive dysfunction associated with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, the manifestations are not due to a direct effect of an altered thyroid state on the central nervous system. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The time course after subtotal thyroidectomy in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism is more variable. It occurs within the first year after surgery in the majority of patients; among those who are euthyroid at one year, approximately 0.5 to 1 percent become hypothyroid each year thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The late onset is presumably due to superimposed chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The high-dose regimens preferred in most centers (to reduce the need for retreatment) result in hypothyroidism in the majority of patients within the first year after therapy; the remainder become hypothyroid at a rate of 0.5 to 2 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/26,27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,29</a>]. A significant minority of patients with toxic or nontoxic multinodular goiter or autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas also become hypothyroid after radioiodine therapy.

Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism (and goiter) worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. When defined as an iodine intake less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> it affects approximately two billion people, many of whom live in mountainous areas. Iodine deficiency is rare in North America because iodized salt is ubiquitous and there are many other sources of iodine in the diet; it persists in parts of Europe because iodized salt is less frequently consumed in some countries. In certain regions (Africa, South America), the effect of iodine deficiency is magnified by consumption of foodstuffs such as cassava roots that contain cyanoglucosides; these substances are metabolized to thiocyanate, which has antithyroid properties and magnifies the effects of iodine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Iodine excess also can cause hypothyroidism by inhibiting iodide organification and T4 and T3 synthesis (the Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Normal subjects quickly &quot;escape&quot; from this effect of iodine. However, patients with abnormal thyroid glands do not, and they can become hypothyroid if given iodine for more than a few days. Patients at risk for iodine-induced hypothyroidism include those with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and those who have had a partial thyroidectomy or a history of radioiodine therapy, painless, postpartum, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. The excess iodine can be derived from health tonics, cough medicines, kelp tablets and other dietary supplements, iodine-containing substances (eg, Betadine) applied to the skin or vagina, drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, and radiographic contrast agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60901 \">table 3</a>).

The hypothyroidism is usually more severe in patients with subacute thyroiditis, while occasional patients with painless thyroiditis will present during the hypothyroid phase of the illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transient hypothyroidism can last from a few weeks to as long as six months in these disorders. Patients with minimal symptoms may not require therapy. Those with symptomatic hypothyroidism should be treated with T4, which can be given for several months, then discontinued.

Less than 1 percent of patients with hypothyroidism have one of these forms of central hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with central hypothyroidism have low or normal serum TSH concentrations (but inappropriately low in the presence of low serum T4 and T3 concentrations). However, a few patients with TSH deficiency have slightly high serum TSH values because they secrete TSH that is less glycosylated and therefore has less biological activity than normal TSH (but is normally immunoreactive).</p><p>Secondary hypothyroidism can be caused by any of the causes of hypopituitarism, most often a pituitary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>). Most patients with pituitary microadenomas are euthyroid, whereas 10 to 25 of those with macroadenomas are hypothyroid, either initially or after surgical or radiation therapy. (A few patients who are initially hypothyroid become euthyroid after resection of a pituitary macroadenoma.)</p><p>Other causes of secondary hypothyroidism include postpartum pituitary necrosis (Sheehan syndrome), trauma, hypophysitis, nonpituitary tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, infiltrative diseases, and inactivating mutations in the gene for either TSH or the TSH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance to thyrotropin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>).

It can also be caused by mutations in the gene for the TRH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Like TSH deficiency, TRH deficiency can be isolated or occur in combination with other hormonal deficiencies. Hypothalamic damage results from tumors, trauma, radiation therapy, or infiltrative diseases.</p><p>TSH deficiency and TRH deficiency cannot be distinguished by biochemical tests. Any patient with findings suggestive of central hypothyroidism should undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamus and pituitary. The results allow inferences to be made as to which hormone is deficient, but the distinction is of no practical importance with respect to the patient's hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE TO THYROID HORMONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder, usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It is caused by mutations in the gene for the beta form of the T3 nuclear receptor. The abnormal receptors have a decreased affinity for T3, the physiologically active hormone within cells; they can also inhibit the action of the normal receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This disorder is included here because a few patients with the syndrome have had findings indicating the presence of hypothyroidism in infancy, such as short stature, deafness, and mental retardation. However, most patients with this disorder are euthyroid (some have a suggestion of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia). There may be an association between this disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disabilities and hearing loss are significant problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>These patients are often discovered by accident as a result of a thyroid test; the characteristic findings are high serum T4 and T3 concentrations, with a normal or high serum TSH concentration. These biochemical findings indicate that the pituitary thyrotroph cells are relatively resistant to T4 and T3 (as are other tissues) and also that high serum T4 and T3 concentrations can overcome the resistance.</p><p>Treatment is usually unnecessary, but T4 or T3 may be given if symptoms of hypothyroidism occur.</p><p>Several other causes of impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone have been described.
