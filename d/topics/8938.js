The following discussion refers to pregnant women who have been subjected to<strong> more than minor trauma.</strong> Optimal care of these patients requires good communication among a multidisciplinary group of clinicians. </p><p>The obstetrical service should be consulted simultaneously with other specialties to help with the evaluation and to determine whether emergency cesarean delivery is indicated. A simple, quick, and crude method for estimating gestational age is to determine the location of the uterine fundus: If below the umbilicus, the pregnancy is likely less than 20 weeks of gestation; if at or above the umbilicus, the pregnancy is likely greater than 20 weeks. This is important because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of cesarean delivery for maternal resuscitation is only warranted if the uterus is above the umbilicus because a uterus this large can compress the vena cava and impede maternal resuscitation (see <a href=\"#H2762394636\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation'</a> below). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cesarean delivery for fetal indications is only warranted if the uterus is above the umbilicus because 22 to 23 weeks is the lower limit of neonatal viability, thus cesarean delivery before 23 weeks would not benefit the neonate. (See <a href=\"#H934020810\" class=\"local\">'Determining gestation age'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periviable-birth-limit-of-viability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periviable birth (Limit of viability)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Any diagnostic test or treatment required to save the mother's life or treat her critical status should be undertaken, even if such intervention is potentially disadvantageous to the fetus. In most cases, short- and long-term morbidity in surviving fetuses are related to the direct and indirect consequences of maternal trauma (eg, hypotension, hypoxemia, abruptio placentae, preterm birth), so maternal treatment can significantly impact the fetus. In some cases, direct fetal injury occurs and may be more serious than maternal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women-with-major-trauma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The initial goal is to assess the maternal airway, breathing, and circulation and establish maternal cardiopulmonary stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women-with-major-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary arrest in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway, breathing, and ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen supplementation should be used liberally, as anoxia develops more quickly in pregnant women. Maternal oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) should be maintained at &gt;95 percent during pregnancy, which is in excess of the oxygen delivery needs of the mother. If SaO2 falls below 95 percent, an arterial blood gas is obtained to measure PaO<sub>2</sub>: Maternal PaO<sub>2</sub> greater than 70 mmHg is desirable to maintain a favorable oxygen diffusion gradient from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta. </p><p>If adequate maternal oxygenation has not been achieved, preoxygenation and early intubation are recommended. Assume a difficult airway as airway edema is more common in pregnant women and can contribute to difficult intubation. Difficulty securing the airway and decreased lower esophageal tone are the primary factors that increase the risk of aspiration. We suggest applying cricoid pressure to prevent aspiration of gastric contents until the airway has been protected with a cuffed endotracheal tube. The value of cricoid pressure has been questioned in nonpregnant individuals because of some evidence that it may impair gas exchange and ventilation; however, no randomized trials that have assessed the efficacy of cricoid pressure in pregnant women. Modifying or releasing cricoid pressure should be considered if there are any problems with ventilation or intubation.</p><p>If intubation is performed, a nasogastric or orogastric tube should be placed for gastric decompression and mitigation of continued aspiration risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929747\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Breathing and ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>If a chest tube is placed, the clinician should keep in mind that the diaphragm is elevated in pregnancy. Some experts suggest placing the thoracostomy tube one to two intercostal spaces above the usual landmark of the fifth intercostal space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women-with-major-trauma/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2587948630\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spine immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal precautions are indicated for all patients who may have a spinal cord injury.

This is best accomplished by placing the woman on her left side, but if this is not possible then putting a wedge or rolled towel under her right hip (or the spinal board) or adjusting her platform to achieve a 30&deg; left lateral tilt is also useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565071024\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We place one or two large bore (eg, 14 or 16 gauge) intravenous lines in women who may have been seriously injured. Fluid replacement should be aggressive as substantial changes in vital signs may not occur until 15 to 20 percent of total blood volume has been lost because of the physiologic hypervolemia of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women-with-major-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Volume replacement is preferable to vasopressors for blood pressure support since vasopressors can reduce uterine blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women-with-major-trauma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Fibrinogen levels &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> are suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can be a complication of placental abruption.

The principle of cesarean delivery if maternal resuscitative efforts have not been successful after four minutes (the &quot;five-minute rule&quot;) has been adopted by the American Heart Association.

The normal fetal heart rate is 110 to 160 beats per minute. It is important to compare the maternal and fetal heart rates to make sure that the fetal heart rate, not the maternal heart rate, is being determined. </p><p>If the gestational age is less than 22 to 23 weeks, documentation of the fetal heart rate alone is adequate. After 23 weeks, and especially if emergency delivery and neonatal resuscitation would be considered, continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring for assessment of both heart rate and pattern is preferable, if feasible.

Bedside ultrasound is an integral component of trauma management used primarily to detect free intraperitoneal blood after blunt trauma. The trauma ultrasound examination focuses on dependent intraperitoneal sites where blood is most likely to accumulate: the hepatorenal space (Morison's pouch), the splenorenal recess, and the inferior portion of the peritoneal cavity (including pouch of Douglas). These studies, when combined with evaluation of the pericardium, are referred to as the FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma).

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy-related changes in physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">test/procedure</span> or treatment required to save the mother's life or treat her critical status should be undertaken, even if potentially disadvantageous to the fetus. Morbidity and mortality in offspring are usually related to the direct and indirect consequences of maternal trauma (eg, hypotension, hypoxemia, placental abruption, preterm birth), but direct fetal injury sometimes occurs. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation and management of major trauma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H51130451\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1915589172\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of the pregnant trauma patient should focus on establishing maternal cardiopulmonary stability. Maternal oxygen saturation (SaO2) should be maintained at &ge;95 percent. Early intubation after preoxygenation is recommended if adequate maternal oxygenation has not been achieved; assume a difficult airway and high risk for gastric aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Airway, breathing, and ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displacing the uterus approximately 30 degrees to the left, off of the vena cava, is critical to maximize effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation when the uterus is at or above the umbilicus. In some instances, emptying the uterus by performing a cesarean delivery is required to save the mother's life. (See <a href=\"#H4189770665\" class=\"local\">'Uterine displacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of the fetal heart rate is the minimum initial fetal assessment to determine whether the fetus is alive, and if alive, whether it is compromised (normal fetal heart rate is 110 to 160 beats per minute). It is important to compare the maternal and fetal heart rates to make sure that the fetal heart rate, not the maternal heart rate, is being monitored. (See <a href=\"#H2395308025\" class=\"local\">'Fetal heart rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In singleton pregnancies, the uterus is a pelvic organ for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The top of the uterine fundus is palpable above the symphysis pubis at about 13 weeks, half-way to the umbilicus by about 16 weeks, at the level of the umbilicus by about 20 weeks of gestation, half-way between the umbilicus and costal margin at about 24 to 28 weeks, and at the costal margin at &gt;34 to 36 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H934020810\" class=\"local\">'Determining gestation age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once catastrophic trauma has been excluded, the clinician should determine whether the patient has any obstetric complications (eg, abruption, uterine rupture, fetomaternal bleeding, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes). The majority of women who develop adverse obstetrical outcomes have symptoms such as contractions, vaginal bleeding, or abdominal pain upon initial presentation. (See <a href=\"#H1289704303\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy evaluation and management after initial maternal stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital vaginal examination should be avoided in pregnancies over 20 weeks until placenta previa has been excluded by ultrasound examination because disturbing the placenta can provoke massive hemorrhage. Vaginal examination should include assessment for bleeding, rupture of membranes, and labor. (See <a href=\"#H2618175461\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound examination of the fetus is indicated if the clinician believes the fetus may have been injured. It is also useful for determining placental position, gestational age, and possibly whether rupture of membranes or abruption has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H2717850104\" class=\"local\">'Role of ultrasound examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pregnancies that have reached the stage of fetal viability (approximately 23 to 24 weeks of gestation), we suggest continuous rather than intermittent fetal and uterine monitoring, when feasible. We monitor patients for at least four hours, and up to 24 hours, after even mild abdominal trauma to look for signs of preterm labor and abruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106538\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106538 \">algorithm 1</a>).
