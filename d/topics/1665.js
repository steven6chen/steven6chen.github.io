It is transmitted primarily by tick vectors. Transmission rarely occurs through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or congenitally. <em>Babesia</em> protozoa infect mammals and cause lysis of host red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p><em>Babesia microti</em> is the primary agent of human babesiosis in the United States, particularly in the Northeast and upper Midwest where it is endemic. Nearly all cases in Europe have been attributed to <em>Babesia divergens</em>,<em> </em>but the infection is sporadic. <em>Babesia venatorum</em> is endemic in northeastern China.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of babesiosis will be reviewed here. The treatment, prevention, microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of babesiosis are discussed separately.

Clinical manifestations may be absent or range from mild to severe.</p><p>The incubation period of <em>B. microti</em> infection following a tick bite typically is one to four weeks; the incubation period after transfusion of contaminated blood products usually is one to nine weeks but has been reported up to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations of babesiosis may develop in individuals with subclinical infection who undergo splenectomy for a medical condition other than babesiosis or who develop an immunosuppressive condition such as malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3224541652\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discrepancy between seroprevalence and the prevalence of clinical disease suggests that asymptomatic infection is common.

Liver enzymes are sometimes elevated, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Total and indirect bilirubin may be elevated.

Infection with <em>B. divergens</em> should be suspected when residents of areas where <em>B. divergens</em> has previously been reported or travelers from these areas present with symptoms consistent with babesiosis, particularly in the setting of asplenia. Nearly all symptomatic cases attributed to <em>B. divergens</em> have occurred in asplenic individuals; at least two asymptomatic cases in immunocompetent people have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of <em>B. divergens</em> infection usually appear abruptly following an incubation period of one to three weeks. The presenting symptoms are persistent high fever (&gt;41&deg;C), shaking chills, intense sweats, headache, myalgia, and lumbar and abdominal pain. Dark urine and jaundice indicate severe intravascular hemolysis. On physical examination, mild hepatomegaly may be noted. Characteristic abnormal laboratory findings are low hemoglobin levels (4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and high parasitemia, which can be as high as 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

All reported patients were asplenic men aged &gt;50 years. Findings on admission included fever (&gt;38&ordm;C) and thrombocytopenia. In two cases, total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated. Hemoglobinuria was noted in a third patient. Peak parasitemia ranged from 20 to 41 percent.

Clinical manifestations are similar to those of <em>B. microti</em> infection, including fever, weakness, malaise, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and dark urine. Laboratory findings may include low hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated liver enzymes.</p><p>Five symptomatic patients with tick-borne <em>B. duncani</em> infection have been documented.

The second case was moderately severe and led to hospital admission because of fever (39&deg;C), headache, jaundice, and dark urine. The third patient presented with weakness, shortness of breath, and lethargy. The fourth case was admitted to the hospital with recurrent fevers, hemolysis, and acute renal failure. In all four cases, remarkable laboratory findings included elevated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase. Parasitemia ranged from 1 to 30 percent. In one case, massive hemolysis required blood transfusion. In all four cases, symptoms resolved with antibiotic therapy, and parasitemia eventually cleared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>Cases of<em> B. venatorum</em> have been reported from mainland China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Two-thirds of individuals were symptomatic.

PCR is more sensitive than microscopy and therefore is useful when parasitemia is very low. PCR also can distinguish between <em>Babesia</em> species.

In the setting of very low parasitemia (particularly at the onset of symptoms), the diagnosis of babesiosis may require examination of multiple smears over several days.

Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are similar to those seen with mild to moderate babesiosis but more pronounced. Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and coma.
