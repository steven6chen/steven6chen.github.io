The pathogenesis of UTIs in women begins with colonization of the vaginal introitus by uropathogens from the fecal flora, followed by ascension via the urethra into the bladder and, in the case of pyelonephritis, to the kidneys via the ureters. </p><p>This topic will review the approach to women with typical symptoms of cystitis when there is no concern that the infection has extended beyond the bladder. We consider this to be uncomplicated cystitis, regardless of other patient characteristics. We consider a UTI to be complicated when there is concern for pyelonephritis or that the infection has otherwise extended beyond the bladder, such as when there is flank pain, fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other signs of systemic illness, including sepsis. </p><p>Our approach to complicated UTI is discussed elsewhere.

Such infections lack signs or symptoms that suggest an infection extending beyond the bladder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated UTI</strong> &ndash; We use the term acute complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) to refer to an acute UTI with any of the following features, which suggest the infection extends beyond the bladder:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever (&gt;99.<span class=\"nowrap\">9&deg;F/37</span>.7&deg;C) &ndash; This temperature threshold is not well defined and should be individualized, taking into account baseline temperature, other potential contributors to an elevated temperature, and the risk of poor outcomes should empiric antimicrobial therapy be inappropriate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills or rigors).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flank pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Costovertebral angle tenderness. </p><p/><p>By this definition, pyelonephritis is a complicated UTI, regardless of patient characteristics. Risk factors for infection with drug-resistant organisms do not, on their own, indicate a complicated UTI. </p><p>The distinction between uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI is important because the treatment approach differs. Complicated UTI is a more serious infection than uncomplicated cystitis. Therefore, expected efficacy of an antimicrobial agent is of greater importance than concern about ecological adverse effects (selection of drug-resistant organisms and the development of colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms), which are a higher priority in the setting of uncomplicated cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, certain agents used for acute uncomplicated cystitis should not be used for complicated UTI because they do not achieve adequate levels in tissue, which may be important for cure.</p><p>Classically, uncomplicated versus complicated cystitis and pyelonephritis have been defined by patient features, such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, renal failure, urologic abnormalities, or immunocompromising conditions. However, our clinical approach to managing UTI is based more on the apparent extent of infection, which informs the risk of severe infection as well as the risk of drug resistance, rather than the classic &quot;complicating&quot; patient features, which do not consistently predict either of these factors. Thus, we favor distinguishing between uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI as defined above. </p><p>The approach to UTI is specific for certain populations, such as pregnant women and renal transplant recipients. These are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2695791268\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystitis among women is extremely common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Given their anatomy, including a shorter distance from the anus to the urethral opening to the bladder, women are at higher risk for UTIs than men. </p><p>Among otherwise healthy women, risk factors for cystitis include recent sexual intercourse and a history of UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Use of spermicide-coated condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides alone are also associated with cystitis risk. Other risk factors include structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, including an indwelling catheter, diabetes mellitus, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899949156\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3697403935\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbial spectrum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Escherichia coli</em> is the most frequent microbial cause of cystitis (75 to 95 percent of cases), with occasional infections caused by other species of Enterobacteriaceae (such as <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>) and other bacteria, such as <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other gram-negative and gram-positive species are infrequently isolated in acute uncomplicated cystitis. Therefore, empiric antimicrobial selection for acute uncomplicated cystitis should be informed by local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of <em>E. coli</em>, in particular. </p><p>The microbial spectrum of cystitis in patients with recent antimicrobial or other health care exposures may be broader and also includes other gram-negative bacilli (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em>), enterococci, staphylococci, and fungi. Thus, culture and susceptibility testing are essential for management in patients who have such risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>). However, even in the absence of specific risk factors, resistance in <em>E. coli</em> can be a major issue. (See <a href=\"#H899949163\" class=\"local\">'Resistance trends in E. coli'</a> below.)</p><p>Among otherwise healthy nonpregnant women, the isolation of organisms such as lactobacilli, enterococci, Group B streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci other than <em>S. saprophyticus</em> from voided midstream urine most commonly represents contamination of the urine specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to consider these organisms the likely causative agent in symptomatic women when found in voided midstream urine at high counts and with pure growth (ie, without growth of other bacteria). That such organisms are rarely the cause of acute uncomplicated cystitis is supported by a study of 202 premenopausal, nonpregnant women with acute cystitis who collected a midstream, clean-catch urine, and subsequently underwent urethral catheterization to collect a bladder urine specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There was high concordance between growth on voided and catheterized specimens for <em>E. coli</em> (even at counts as low as 10 colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">[CFU]/mL),</span> <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, and <em>S. saprophyticus</em>. In contrast, enterococci and Group B streptococci were isolated from 20 and 25 voided specimens, respectively, but only from two corresponding catheterized specimens each. In the majority of specimens with these organisms, growth was &lt;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL,</span> and <em>E. coli</em> was also isolated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899949163\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance trends in E. coli</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expected susceptibility patterns of <em>E. coli</em> should inform the empiric antimicrobial selection for cystitis, and increasing rates of resistance have been reported globally. Risk factors for UTI with resistant organisms include recent broad-spectrum antimicrobial use, health care exposures, and travel to parts of the world where multidrug-resistant organisms are prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>). Ongoing monitoring of resistance is necessary for optimization of empiric therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2761251353\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial selection'</a> below.)</p><p>The in vitro susceptibility of <em>E. coli</em> varies considerably by geographic region. In four large studies, overall resistance rates were higher in medical centers in the United States than in Canada, and higher in Portugal and Spain than in other European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. In general, resistance rates &gt;20 percent were reported in all regions for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> and in many regions for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> (with or without sulfamethoxazole). </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrofurantoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a>, and pivmecillinam (the last is not available in the United States) have demonstrated good in vitro activity in all countries investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>] and are thus appropriate first-line agents for acute uncomplicated cystitis when there are no clear risk factors for resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Resistance rates for first and second generation oral cephalosporins and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are regionally variable but generally &lt;10 percent. </p><p>Fluoroquinolone resistance rates had been &lt;10 percent in most parts of North America and Europe, but there has been a clear trend of increasing resistance over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. In a study of <em>E. coli</em> urinary isolates from outpatients in the United States, resistance rates to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> increased from 3 to 17 percent between 2000 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. More specifically, in a population-based study of over 5000 <em>E. coli</em> urinary isolates collected in Minnesota between 2005 and 2009, the incidence of urinary isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) increased among older adult patients and those with community-associated isolates, but not among health care-associated cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One caveat in interpreting these data is that passive laboratory-based surveillance methods tend to overestimate true resistance rates since they are skewed by urine cultures obtained from patients who may have failed initial therapy or who have specific risk factors for resistance, such as recent travel or antimicrobial use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p>TMP-SMX is the agent for which there are the most data to guide clinical use; identified risk factors for resistance in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis include use of TMP-SMX in the preceding three to six months and travel, particularly international travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. In addition, clinical, in vitro, and mathematical modeling studies have suggested that a 20 percent resistance prevalence should be the threshold at which TMP-SMX should not be used for empiric treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>For other antimicrobial agents, there are insufficient data to determine the resistance levels at which the likelihood of failure outweighs the potential benefits; the decision depends on individual practitioner discretion. In addition, it is important for clinicians to understand that local resistance rates reported in hospital antibiograms are often skewed by cultures of samples obtained from hospitalized patients or those with complicated infection and may not accurately predict susceptibilities in women with acute uncomplicated community-acquired cystitis, in whom resistance rates tend to be lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, resistant infections are increasing in number, including those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. An increase in ESBL-producing isolates has been described among patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. In particular, a specific strain of <em>E. coli</em>, sequence type 131 (ST131), has emerged globally as a major cause of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing <em>E. coli</em> UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899949170\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic clinical manifestations of cystitis consist of dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and suprapubic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Hematuria is also often observed.</p><p>Although these are the most common presenting features, symptoms of cystitis can be subtle and more difficult to tease out, particularly in older women. Older women can have a number of nonspecific urinary symptoms (such as chronic dysuria or urinary incontinence) that mimic symptoms of cystitis, even when there is no evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI). A systematic review of studies evaluating the diagnosis of UTI among community-dwelling adults older than 65 years suggested that symptoms such as chronic urinary nocturia, incontinence, and general sense of lack of well-being were common and nonspecific for UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In contrast, acute dysuria (less than one week duration), new or worsening urinary urgency, new incontinence, frequency, gross hematuria, and suprapubic pain or tenderness were more discriminating symptoms. Fever was also a discriminating feature, although we consider patients with cystitis symptoms and fever to have a complicated UTI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults#H12414267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, among debilitated patients, many generalized signs or symptoms, such as falls, change in functional status, and change in mental status, are frequently attributed to UTI, although growing evidence indicates that these are not reliable predictors of bacteriuria or cystitis. In one cohort study of nursing home residents, among clinical features that prompted evaluation for UTI (including change in gait or falls, change in functional status, fever or chills), only acute dysuria, change in the character of urine (gross hematuria, change in color or odor), and change in mental status were associated with the presence of both pyuria and bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, other studies that controlled for comorbidities have found no association between bacteriuria in nursing home patients and nonspecific mental status changes (such as increased restlessness, confusion, or aggression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among those with bacteriuria, there also appears to be no association between these nonspecific mental status changes and urinary markers of inflammation (ie, interleukin-6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Furthermore, treatment of bacteriuria in patients with acute delirium or nonspecific symptoms is not associated with improvement in mental or functional status (but is associated with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Although cloudy or smelly urine may be associated with bacteriuria (as demonstrated in nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]), and, anecdotally, these changes in urine character are sometimes associated with subsequent onset of symptomatic UTI, there is no evidence of any benefit to treating as a UTI prior to onset of usual cystitis symptoms. Color and odor of urine are influenced by ingestion of certain foods, dehydration, and other noninfectious factors. Thus, increased fluid intake and careful observation are reasonable approaches to patients who complain of changes in odor or color of urine.</p><p>Fever, chills, rigors, and other signs of systemic illness are not compatible with a diagnosis of acute uncomplicated cystitis and raise the possibility of pyelonephritis or other complication of UTI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899949177\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1530531830\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical suspicion and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute uncomplicated cystitis should be suspected in women who have acute symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suprapubic pain, particularly in the absence of vaginal symptoms (eg, vaginal pruritus or discharge). The probability of cystitis is greater than 50 percent in women with any of these symptoms and greater than 90 percent in women who have dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Women should be asked about <span class=\"nowrap\">fevers/chills</span> and flank pain. Physical examination is often not necessary for the diagnosis, but if performed, should include assessment for fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and abdominal tenderness. A pelvic examination is indicated if factors suggesting vaginitis or urethritis are present. If fever (&gt;99.<span class=\"nowrap\">9&deg;F/37</span>.7&deg;C), other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills or rigors), flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness are present, the patient should be evaluated and managed as potentially having complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), which is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For most women with suspected acute uncomplicated cystitis, particularly those with classic symptoms, no additional testing is warranted to make the diagnosis. </p><p>However, in women who have clinical features that are suggestive, but not clearly diagnostic of cystitis (such as atypical urinary symptoms), urinalysis is a useful diagnostic tool, as the absence of pyuria on urinalysis suggests a diagnosis other than cystitis. Apart from the classic features listed above, features that should prompt urine testing include new or worsening urinary urgency, new incontinence, gross hematuria. Chronic urinary nocturia, chronic incontinence, general malaise, and cloudy or malodorous urine are nonspecific findings that should not routinely prompt urine testing to evaluate for cystitis. We do not routinely test urine in elderly or debilitated patients with nonspecific changes in mental or functional status in the absence of focal urinary tract symptoms, and instead hydrate, carefully observe, and assess other potential contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. If fever is also present, evaluation for infection, including complicated UTI, is warranted.

It is often not indicated in women with typical symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis (in whom the diagnosis can reliably be made on symptoms alone), but it can be helpful in cases in which the clinical presentation is not typical. Pyuria is present in almost all women with acute cystitis; its absence strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most accurate method for assessing pyuria is to examine an unspun, voided midstream urine specimen under the microscope with a hemocytometer; an abnormal result is &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">leukocytes/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The presence of hematuria is helpful since it is common in the setting of UTI but not in urethritis or vaginitis. However, hematuria is not a predictor for complicated infection and does not warrant extended therapy. White blood cell casts in the urine, although rare, are indicative of upper tract infection rather than simple cystitis.

(See <a href=\"#H207461713\" class=\"local\">'First-line antimicrobial options'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4088013911\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial sparing strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that acute uncomplicated cystitis is associated with increasing antimicrobial resistance and has a low risk of progression to invasive disease, antimicrobial-sparing management strategies are of increasing interest (eg, anti-inflammatory drugs or delayed treatment), but warrant further study before they can be routinely employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/77,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,80,81</a>]. </p><p>In one trial of 241 women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, those randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (400 mg three times daily for three days) had a higher mean symptom burden compared with those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> as a single 3 g dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Fewer women in the ibuprofen group received any antimicrobials compared with the fosfomycin group (35 versus 100 percent), but they were more likely to require additional therapy with antimicrobials in follow-up and had a higher rate of serious adverse events, including five cases of pyelonephritis (2 percent) compared with one case (0.4 percent) in the fosfomycin group. Similar findings were observed in a trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

In fact, dysuria is usually diminished within a few hours after the start of antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In the interim, for some patients with severe dysuria, a urinary analgesic such as over-the-counter oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a> three times daily as needed may be useful to relieve discomfort. A two-day course is usually sufficient to allow time for symptomatic response to antimicrobial therapy and minimize inflammation. Phenazopyridine should not be used chronically since it may mask clinical symptoms requiring clinical evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4146053135\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with urologic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, patients with underlying functional or anatomic urinary tract abnormalities (such as an indwelling catheter, urethral stent, neurogenic bladder, nephrolithiasis) have systemic symptoms (such as fever or autonomic dysreflexia) in the setting of UTI and are thus managed as having a complicated UTI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults#H12414288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>For those who truly have acute uncomplicated cystitis, additional treatment measures in addition to antimicrobial therapy may be warranted. These include more frequent intermittent catheterization, changing out an indwelling catheter prior to obtaining a urine culture (particularly if it has been in place for longer than one or two weeks), or <span class=\"nowrap\">urologic/urogynecologic</span> consultation. </p><p>Furthermore, the antimicrobial durations listed above (see <a href=\"#H207461713\" class=\"local\">'First-line antimicrobial options'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1112172929\" class=\"local\">'Alternative antimicrobial options'</a> above) have not been well studied in patients with urologic dysfunction, and a longer duration of therapy (eg, one to two weeks, depending on the agent chosen) is reasonable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899949241\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up urine cultures are not needed in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis whose symptoms resolve on antimicrobials. </p><p>Patients who have persistent symptoms after 48 to 72 hours of empiric antimicrobial therapy or have recurrent symptoms within a few weeks of treatment should have additional evaluation for other potential conditions that may be causing those symptoms and for factors that might be compromising clinical response. This includes urine culture and empiric treatment with another antimicrobial agent. Subsequent treatment should be tailored to the susceptibility profile of the causative organism isolated.

Such infections lack features that suggest infection extends beyond the bladder, such as fever (&gt;99.<span class=\"nowrap\">9&deg;F/37</span>.7&deg;C), other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills and rigors), flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness. (See <a href=\"#H3308263302\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Escherichia coli</em> is the most frequent microbial cause of cystitis, with occasional infections caused by other species of Enterobacteriaceae, such as <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and other bacteria, such as <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus. </em>The microbial spectrum of cystitis in patients with recent antimicrobial or other health care exposures may be broader and also include other gram-negative bacilli (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em>), enterococci, staphylococci, and fungi. Increasing rates of resistance in uropathogens have been reported globally. Risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI) with resistant organisms include recent broad-spectrum antimicrobial use, health care exposures, and travel to parts of the world where multidrug-resistant organisms are prevalent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>).

Symptoms of cystitis can be subtle and more difficult to tease out, particularly in older or debilitated women, who can have a number of nonspecific urinary symptoms (such as chronic dysuria or urinary incontinence) that could mimic symptoms of cystitis even when there is no evidence of UTI. (See <a href=\"#H899949170\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with classic symptoms of cystitis, no additional testing is warranted to make the diagnosis. For women who have atypical urinary symptoms, the diagnosis is supported by the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria on urinalysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture. Chronic urinary nocturia, chronic incontinence, general malaise, and cloudy or malodorous urine are nonspecific findings that should not routinely prompt urine testing to evaluate for cystitis. (See <a href=\"#H1530531830\" class=\"local\">'Clinical suspicion and evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H385532615\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selection of an antimicrobial regimen for acute uncomplicated cystitis depends on the risk of infection with a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F115993\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115993 \">algorithm 1</a>).

If all these are appropriate options based on patient circumstances, local resistance rates, and prior urinary isolates, we suggest nitrofurantoin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
