The medicines your doctor or nurse prescribes to treat high blood pressure can help reduce the risk of these problems and even help you live longer.</p><p>It's very important that you take your blood pressure medicines every day as directed. High blood pressure doesn't usually cause symptoms, so people sometimes don't take it seriously. Plus, blood pressure medicines can cause side effects and be expensive, so it's easy to understand why people don't like to take them. But if you are tempted to skip your medicines, remember, they can save your life!</p><p>If your medicines cause unpleasant side effects, or if you can't afford your medicines, talk to your doctor or nurse. There are often ways to deal with these problems. The first step is to let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37202012\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are lots of different medicines to treat high blood pressure. But some of the medicines have other health benefits besides lowering blood pressure.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will decide which medicine is best for you depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How high your blood pressure is</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your other health problems, if you have any</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well you do on the medicines you try</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse might need to change your medicine or its dose a couple of times to find the medicine and dose that work best and cause the fewest side effects. Plus, you might need to take more than 1 medicine to get your blood pressure under control. Whatever your doctor or nurse prescribes, it's important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59726 \">table 1</a>). But always let your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems with the medicines. That way he or she can make changes so that you are as comfortable as possible and also get the most benefit. Never stop or make changes to the way you take your medicines without talking to your doctor or nurse first.</p><p>Below is a list of the most common types of medicine given to people with high blood pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;diuretics&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors&quot; (&quot;ACE inhibitors&quot;) or &quot;angiotensin receptor blockers&quot; (&quot;ARBs&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;calcium channel blockers&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;beta blockers&quot;</p><p/><p>This article has only some basic information on these medicines. For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37202019\"><span class=\"h1\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretics are sometimes called &quot;water pills,&quot; because they make you urinate more than usual. Some examples of diuretics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">chlorthalidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">indapamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> (also known as HCTZ), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">furosemide</a> (brand name: Lasix).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37202026\"><span class=\"h1\">ACE inhibitors and ARBs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACE inhibitors and ARBs are often grouped together, because they work in similar ways. These medicines can help prevent kidney disease. Doctors often prescribe them for people with diabetes, because people with diabetes have a higher-than-average risk of kidney disease.</p><p>Some examples of ACE inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">enalapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">captopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lisinopril</a>. Some examples of ARBs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">candesartan</a> (brand name: Atacand) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">valsartan</a> (brand name: Diovan).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37202033\"><span class=\"h1\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some examples of calcium channel blockers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">amlodipine</a> (brand name: Norvasc), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">felodipine</a> (brand name: Plendil), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diltiazem</a> (brand name: Cardizem). These medicines also help prevent chest pain caused by heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37202040\"><span class=\"h1\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Besides lowering blood pressure, beta blockers help reduce the amount of work the heart has to do. Studies show that people who take a beta blocker after a heart attack are less likely to have another heart attack or die than people who don't take a beta blocker. Studies also show that people with heart failure who take beta blockers live longer than people with heart failure who don't.</p><p>When people first start taking beta-blockers, they sometimes feel tired. That is just while the body gets used to the medicine. But once the body gets used to beta blockers, the medicines can really help. If your doctor prescribes a beta blocker, give it a little time to start working.</p><p>Some examples of beta blockers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">atenolol</a> (brand name: Tenormin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">metoprolol</a> (brand names: Lopressor, Toprol-XL), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">propranolol</a> (brand name: Inderal LA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37202153\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-an-ischemic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after an ischemic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
