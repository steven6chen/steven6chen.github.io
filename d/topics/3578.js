It is generally considered to be irreversible in its advanced stages, at which point the only option may be liver transplantation. In earlier stages, specific treatments aimed at the underlying cause of liver disease may improve or even reverse cirrhosis. </p><p>Patients with cirrhosis are susceptible to a variety of complications, and their life expectancy can be markedly reduced. Cirrhosis accounted for approximately 49,500 deaths and was the eighth leading cause of death in the United States in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, there were an estimated 19,500 deaths due to liver cancer, which often occurs in the setting of cirrhosis. Similarly, a study that used data from the National Death Index from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Rochester Epidemiology Project estimated that liver disease was responsible for 66,007 deaths in 2008, of which 18,175 were due to hepatobiliary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the complications, general management, and prognosis of cirrhosis. An overview of the causes and diagnosis of cirrhosis is presented separately.

It is typically treated with endoscopic variceal band ligation. Other treatments include endoscopic sclerotherapy and placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the management of variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Variceal hemorrhage is associated with high mortality rates. In the past, the mortality rate of a single variceal hemorrhage was 30 percent, and only one-third of patients survived for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Although survival has improved with modern techniques for controlling variceal hemorrhage, mortality rates remain high (15 to 20 percent 30-day mortality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65798842\"><span class=\"h3\">Portal hypertensive gastropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portal hypertensive gastropathy (congestive gastropathy), while extremely common in patients with portal hypertension, is an uncommon cause of significant bleeding in these patients. When portal hypertensive gastropathy is the sole cause of bleeding, there is diffuse mucosal oozing with no other lesions, such as varices, to account for the GI bleeding and anemia. The mucosa is friable, and bleeding presumably occurs when the ectatic vessels rupture. The severity of gastropathy is related to the level of portal pressure, the level of hepatic vascular resistance, and the degree of reduction in hepatic blood flow (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertensive-gastropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertensive gastropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65798854\"><span class=\"h3\">Ascites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. It is the most common complication of cirrhosis. The first step leading to fluid retention and ultimately ascites in patients with cirrhosis is the development of portal hypertension. Patients without portal hypertension do not develop ascites or edema. Those with ascites have several circulatory, vascular, functional, and biochemical abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of fluid retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ascites is typically treated with a combination of diuretics and sodium restriction, though some patients require repeated therapeutic paracenteses or TIPS placement. Among patients with refractory ascites or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the use of nonselective beta blockers may be associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This may occur because failure to maintain an adequate mean arterial blood pressure is strongly correlated with survival in patients with advanced cirrhosis.

SBP is almost always seen in the setting of end-stage liver disease. Clinical manifestations of SBP include fever, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, and altered mental status. Some patients are asymptomatic and present with only mild laboratory abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The index of suspicion for SBP must be high with a low threshold for diagnostic paracentesis. The diagnosis is established by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span>. Without early antibiotic treatment, mortality is high.

Rather than being a new disease, hepatorenal syndrome usually represents the end-stage of a sequence of reductions in renal perfusion induced by increasingly severe hepatic injury. Arterial vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation, which is triggered by portal hypertension, appears to play a central role in the hemodynamic changes and the decline in renal function in hepatorenal syndrome. The initial reductions in glomerular filtration rate are often masked clinically since associated decreases in muscle mass and hepatic urea production minimize elevations in the plasma creatinine concentration and blood urea nitrogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Hepatorenal syndrome is characterized by a generally benign urine sediment, a very low rate of sodium excretion, and a progressive rise in the plasma creatinine concentration. There is some confusion regarding the presence or absence of oliguria. The percentage of patients with oliguria depends upon the cut-off for defining oliguria. If the cutoff is 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day,</span> only 44 percent of patients are oliguric. If 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> is used, approximately two-thirds are oliguric. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is one of exclusion, being made when other causes of renal dysfunction have been excluded. In particular, volume depletion (as with overly rapid diuresis) can mimic all of the findings of hepatorenal syndrome. The prognosis is poor unless hepatic function improves or a liver transplantation is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65798866\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatic hydrothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic hydrothorax is defined as the presence of a pleural effusion in a patient with cirrhosis and no evidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. It results from the movement of ascitic fluid into the pleural space through defects in the diaphragm, and it is usually right-sided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-hydrothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic hydrothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment for hepatic hydrothorax includes diuretics and sodium restriction. Patients who do not respond to conservative therapy may require repeated therapeutic thoracenteses or TIPS. The most important aspect of management is evaluation for liver transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80148\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80148 \">algorithm 1</a>). Chest tubes should <strong>not</strong> be placed in patients with hepatic hydrothorax. Placement of chest tubes in this setting can result in massive protein and electrolyte depletion, infection, renal failure, and bleeding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65798872\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatopulmonary syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined by the following triad (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatopulmonary-syndrome-in-adults-prevalence-causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatopulmonary syndrome in adults: Prevalence, causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased alveolar-arterial gradient while breathing room air</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence for intrapulmonary vascular abnormalities, referred to as intrapulmonary vascular dilatations</p><p/><p>Estimates of the prevalence of HPS among patients with chronic liver disease range from 4 to 47 percent, depending on the diagnostic criteria and methods used. Even in those without HPS, mild hypoxemia is common and is presumably caused by ascites, with resulting diaphragmatic elevation and <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch. There are no effective medical therapies for HPS. Liver transplantation offers the most promise for successful treatment.

Neither the prevalence nor the severity of portopulmonary hypertension appears to correlate with the degree of portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portopulmonary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portopulmonary hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with portopulmonary hypertension may present with fatigue, dyspnea, peripheral edema, chest pain, and syncope. The diagnosis may be suggested by echocardiography and confirmed by right heart catheterization. Patients with moderate to severe portopulmonary hypertension are difficult to treat with medical therapy, and the perioperative mortality with liver transplantation is high. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65799163\"><span class=\"h3\">Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 50 percent of patients with advanced cirrhosis have features of cardiac dysfunction. The term &quot;cirrhotic cardiomyopathy&quot; has been used to describe such patients, who are characterized as having normal to increased cardiac output and contractility at rest, but a blunted response to pharmacologic, physiologic, or pathologic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients may also have electrophysiologic abnormalities. It is thought to be related to both portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Cardiomyopathy can occur from any cause of cirrhosis, although patients with alcoholism or hemochromatosis may have additional contributing causes to cardiac dysfunction.

Patients with most forms of chronic hepatitis are not at an increased risk until cirrhosis develops. Exceptions to this rule are patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, who can develop HCC in the absence of cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certain causes of cirrhosis appear to have a relatively increased risk for HCC. Patients with cirrhosis from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and hemochromatosis are at the highest risk, while those with cirrhosis from autoimmune hepatitis and Wilson disease appear to have a lower risk.

Decompensation in a patient with previously compensated cirrhosis should raise the clinical suspicion that HCC has developed. Other common signs and symptoms of HCC are usually related to mass effect from the tumor and include pain, early satiety, obstructive jaundice, and a palpable mass. HCCs can rupture, causing hemoperitoneum. Paraneoplastic manifestations include erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia, and diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of HCC may be suggested by marked elevations of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or by characteristic radiographic findings. Elevated AFP is not specific for HCC since it can also be seen in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis, gonadal tumors, and pregnancy. However, rising serum AFP levels in a patient with cirrhosis should raise clinical suspicion for HCC. However, a significant proportion of patients with HCC have normal AFP levels, especially when the tumor is small. As a result, a normal AFP does not preclude a diagnosis.

The pathogenesis of hyponatremia is directly related to the hemodynamic changes and secondary neurohumoral adaptations that occur in the setting of cirrhosis, resulting in an impaired ability to excrete ingested water. The severity of the hyponatremia is related to the severity of the cirrhosis. The management of hyponatremia is discussed elsewhere.

Because the liver makes coagulation factors as well as anticoagulant proteins, liver disease can lead to a hypocoagulable state or a hypercoagulable state. The relative balance or imbalance of these factors is not reflected in conventional indices of coagulation, such as the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or INR.

While plasma is commonly given to patients with chronic liver disease and an elevated INR, plasma infusion may have adverse effects on portal vein pressures and collateral vessel flow.

In a study of 143 patients who were admitted to the hospital with decompensated cirrhosis, relative adrenal insufficiency was detected in 37 patients (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. At the time of presentation, compared with patients who did not have relative adrenal insufficiency, patients with relative adrenal insufficiency had lower mean arterial pressures (76 versus 83 mmHg) and serum sodium levels (131 versus 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and had higher blood urea nitrogen levels (32 versus 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. During three months of follow-up, patients with relative adrenal insufficiency were more likely to develop infection (41 versus 21 percent), severe sepsis (27 versus 9 percent), type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (16 versus 3 percent), and death (22 versus 7 percent).

Two commonly used models are the Child-Pugh classification and MELD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52738331\"><span class=\"h3\">Child-Pugh classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Child-Pugh classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 5</a>) has been used to assess the risk of non-shunt operations in patients with cirrhosis (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is a modification of the Child-Turcotte classification, which incorporated five variables that were designed to stratify the risk of portacaval shunt surgery in patients with cirrhosis. The variables included the serum albumin and bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy, and nutritional status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56436 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The Child-Pugh classification replaces nutritional status with prothrombin time. The score ranges from 5 to 15. Patients with a score of 5 or 6 have Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (well-compensated cirrhosis), those with a score of 7 to 9 have Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis (significant functional compromise), and those with a score of 10 to 15 have Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis (decompensated cirrhosis). </p><p>In a review of 92 patients with cirrhosis who underwent abdominal surgery, the mortality rate was 10 percent for patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, 30 percent for patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis, and 82 percent for patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Other studies have validated the utility of the Child-Pugh classification for the assessment of surgical risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Child-Pugh class is also associated with the likelihood of developing of complications of cirrhosis. As an example, patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis are much more likely to develop variceal hemorrhage than those with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52738337\"><span class=\"h3\">MELD score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another model to predict prognosis in patients with cirrhosis is the MELD score.

The MELD score has been adopted for use in prioritizing patients awaiting liver transplantation and has an expanding role in predicting outcomes in patients with liver disease in the non-transplantation setting. In January 2016, Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Policy 9.1 (MELD Score) was updated to include serum sodium as a factor in the calculation of the MELD score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/allocation-calculators/meld-calculator/&amp;token=iRMJIIdlcCMEXBWgyUXhEj85JXUmTLBxW0uB0IuIJz7WR7PrHBxXi2mI3BwjTJvu4iYyowpPMNpkTBUTjvT81BphmAxTsPpJApITG494Mzc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1263\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The MELDNa score</a> can be calculated online.
