The condition used to be called &quot;premature ovarian failure&quot; and &quot;premature menopause,&quot; but these terms are misleading, because women with POI do not always stop menstruating (having periods), and their ovaries do not always completely shut down [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. That's important to keep in mind, because the diagnosis of POI does not always mean that pregnancy is impossible. What's more, the condition does not imply that a woman is aging prematurely. It simply means that her ovaries are not working as well.</p><p>In women with POI, the ovaries:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop releasing eggs, or release them only intermittently, and</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop producing the hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, or produce them only intermittently</p><p/><p>Given these effects, POI makes pregnancy unlikely. Learning of this can be emotionally devastating to some women, especially if they have not had children or want more children. If that is true for you, take some time to heal emotionally and to learn about your options, including adoption, donor oocytes, surrogacy, and remaining childless.</p><p>Take time to honor your feelings of grief and loss. Being diagnosed with POI can be a life-changing experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is natural to feel down, but be mindful of depression. You may even want to seek out counseling or to participate in a professionally monitored support group for women with POI. If you have a partner, remember that he or she may also be affected by your diagnosis, so it might be useful to find help in processing related emotions for the two of you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the vast majority of cases, health care providers do not know why primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) occurs. Some cases of the condition can be explained by genetic abnormalities, exposure to toxins, or autoimmune disorders, but most cases are &quot;idiopathic,&quot; meaning they have no known cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Even so, it is important for women to be tested for the known causes of POI. Some of the known causes may be associated with other effects on your health or the health of your family members.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic causes of POI may be due to abnormal chromosomes or abnormal individual genes. Chromosomes are structures that house thousands of genes. Chromosomal abnormalities that lead to POI include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turner syndrome &ndash; The sex of a person is determined by their complement of X and Y chromosomes. Women normally have two X chromosomes, while men have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In Turner syndrome, women have only one X chromosome; the other one is missing. The lack of a second X chromosome (Turner syndrome) is the most common chromosomal defect in humans. It causes abnormalities throughout the reproductive system and can cause POI. Missing just a portion of one X chromosome (a critical portion) can also cause POI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fragile X syndrome &ndash; Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of intellectual disability (mental retardation) worldwide. People who have fragile X have a defective gene on the X chromosome. Those who have the defective gene do not always have intellectual disability, but the genetic abnormality can worsen with each successive generation; hence, a woman whose POI is caused by a change in the fragile X gene is at risk of having an intellectually disabled baby, if she is able to conceive and give birth. For this reason, women who are carriers for the abnormality in the fragile X gene are advised to undergo genetic counseling before trying to get pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other chromosomal and genetic causes &ndash; Several other chromosomal and genetic abnormalities can lead to POI. For example, some women have Y chromosome material, even though the Y chromosome should exist only in men. Although this condition is rare, women who have Y chromosome material need to have their ovaries removed because the abnormality can cause ovarian tumors. Other genetic abnormalities that can cause POI include those that impair normal hormonal function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of toxin-induced ovarian insufficiency are chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy, both of which are used to treat cancer (chemotherapy drugs are also often used to treat diseases like severe rheumatoid arthritis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The job of the immune system is to identify and destroy foreign or abnormal cells that can cause infection, cancer, or other problems. Unfortunately, the immune system sometimes misdirects its efforts and begins attacking the body's normal, healthy cells. In some cases of POI, the immune system mistakenly attacks hormone-producing (endocrine) organs, including not only the ovaries but also the adrenal glands, the thyroid glands, and other structures.</p><p>Women whose ovarian insufficiency is caused by an autoimmune disorder should have their adrenal and thyroid function evaluated. If the adrenal glands are affected, it can cause a very serious and potentially life-threatening condition called primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) undergo a normal puberty and have regular periods before developing ovarian insufficiency. The most common symptom that prompts them to seek medical care is missed or infrequent periods.</p><p>Some women first notice that their periods are infrequent or absent when they stop taking birth control pills, but that does not mean that the pills caused POI. While taking the pill may mask the condition, it cannot cause it.</p><p>Other POI symptoms include hot flashes or vaginal dryness, because women eventually produce little or no estrogen. As the condition progresses, some women may also develop vaginal dryness and thinning of the vaginal walls, which can make intercourse painful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Family planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POI often interferes with a woman's ability to get pregnant. Even so, between 5 and 10 percent of women with the condition are able to conceive and give birth normally. Others become pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF) using donor eggs. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Infertility treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are younger than 40 years and have not had a regular period for three months or longer, see a health care provider for a full evaluation.</p><p>Even if you do not want to get pregnant, the condition can have broad-reaching implications for your overall health. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) who do not take hormone replacement (estrogen) are at increased risk for osteoporosis and heart disease, so it's important that the condition be detected early and managed appropriately.</p><p>To determine the cause of your irregular, absent, or unusually light periods, your health care provider should ask whether:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have symptoms besides light, irregular, or absent periods. Some women with POI have hot flashes or vaginal dryness, and these symptoms hold clues about how the ovaries are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had surgery on your ovaries, or received chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as these all damage ovarian tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You or any of your family members have any autoimmune diseases, such as polyglandular failure, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, vitiligo, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, lupus, hypoparathyroidism, recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis. A personal or family history of these conditions can point to autoimmune ovarian insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-autoimmune-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of autoimmune primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have any symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as decreased appetite, weight loss, vague abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue, salt craving, or darkening of the skin. These symptoms are important, because roughly 3 percent of women with POI develop adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any of your family members have POI. Approximately 10 percent of cases of ovarian insufficiency run in families.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a family history of fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability (mental retardation), or developmental delay. A family history of these conditions suggests that fragile X syndrome could be involved in your diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have any hearing loss, because some genetic causes of POI can cause deafness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Important tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to asking you detailed questions about your personal and family history and performing a physical examination, your health care provider should order a blood test to measure various hormone levels.</p><p>To be diagnosed with POI, you must have elevated levels of a hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). High levels of FSH indicate that your brain is trying to stimulate the ovaries but the ovaries are not responding. That's important because the ovaries sometimes fail not because they are dysfunctional, but because the brain or the body's master gland, the pituitary, has stopped properly regulating ovarian function.</p><p>If blood tests confirm that you have POI, your health care provider should then look for a potential cause. Tests used to determine the cause of the disorder include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Karyotyping, which determines whether any chromosomal abnormalities exist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for antibodies against the adrenal gland, which determines if you have a specific type of ovarian autoimmunity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for the <em>FMR1</em> premutation, a genetic test to determine if you have a specific form of POI</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444454\"><span class=\"h2\">Taking care of you</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is more than infertility and affects a woman's physical and emotional well-being. Management of the condition must address both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Before deciding about your plans for a family, it is first important to be healthy yourself. There are multiple choices available to you if you decide you want to become a parent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the main goals of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treatment is replacing the estrogen that the ovaries have stopped producing. That's important because estrogen is vital to certain normal processes. The bones, for example, need estrogen stimulation to stay strong and resistant to fracture. Without estrogen, women with POI are at risk of developing the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.</p><p>There is also evidence that a lack of estrogen before the age of 45 years can increase the risk of heart disease. What's more, without estrogen, women often develop symptoms of menopause, namely hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, and vaginal dryness. Estrogen therapy aims to prevent or alleviate all of these consequences of estrogen deficiency. However, most women cannot take estrogen alone; they must combine it with a progestin (a form of progesterone) to prevent a condition that could lead to cancer of the uterus.</p><p>Most experts currently recommend that women with POI should take estrogen until age 50 to 51 years, the average age of menopause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main form of estrogen that the ovaries normally produce is called estradiol. Some experts believe that giving women this type of estrogen best mimics the &quot;natural condition,&quot; but other forms of estrogen are available and are also effective.</p><p>Women who opt for estradiol can get it in pill form, in a patch that is worn on the skin, or in a ring that is inserted into the vagina. The estradiol patch and vaginal ring may offer advantages over the pill form, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They deliver the same hormone that the ovaries make</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estrogen does not have to go through the liver to get into the bloodstream</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estrogen gets into the body in a slow, steady stream, rather than all at once</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estrogen can be measured easily in the bloodstream</p><p/><p>Despite the advantages the patch and ring may have, other forms of estrogen replacement are also effective, and women should choose the form that best suits them. Some women do not like wearing the patch or using the ring; others develop skin irritation when they wear the patch. For them, hormones in pill form may be a better choice. In addition, oral estrogen is often less expensive than the estradiol patch or ring. Regardless of the form of estrogen they choose, most women must also take some form of progestin (a type of progesterone). With progestins, women also have choices. They come in patch or pill form, and there are synthetic and &quot;natural&quot; versions.</p><p>Women who wish to avoid pregnancy can take birth control pills. Low-dose hormone therapy does not prevent pregnancy. Women with POI commonly experience unpredictable and intermittent ovarian function, and it is estimated that there is an approximate 4 percent chance of ovulating each month.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women taking estrogen and progestin may worry about the risks of hormone replacement therapy. After all, recent studies have linked the use of these hormones with an elevated risk of heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer, among other things. The fact is, those studies looked at the effects of estrogen and progestin in women who were in their 60s and 70s and who had undergone menopause naturally.</p><p>The results of those studies do not apply to younger women with POI. On the contrary, studies in women with the condition suggest that they are more likely to have cardiovascular problems if they don't take hormones than if they do. Plus, forgoing hormones can lead to osteoporosis.</p><p>Most experts agree, in general, that young women with POI should use hormone therapy at least until they turn 50 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infertility treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, between 5 and 10 percent of women with POI are able to conceive and give birth normally without any special treatment. Treatment with estrogen, fertility drugs, or other hormones, has not been shown to improve fertility.</p><p>One treatment that is successful is in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor eggs. In one report of 61 women with POI undergoing 90 treatment cycles, the cumulative chance of pregnancy after three cycles was approximately 90 percent. Success rates for this procedure depend primarily on the age of the egg donor. Embryo donation, in which frozen embryos are donated to the couple, is also often successful and, in general, less expensive.</p><p>If you are interested in becoming pregnant, work with your health care provider to identify the cause of your condition before you start trying to conceive. Some underlying causes of POI can adversely affect a pregnancy or a fetus, if a pregnancy is successful. For some women, adoption is a good option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI, also called premature ovarian failure) can be emotionally trying.
