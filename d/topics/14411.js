Patients with an alcohol intake of 30 or more grams per day (one standard drink contains 14 grams of alcohol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56818 \">figure 1</a>)) are at increased risk of cirrhosis, although the majority of patients will not develop cirrhosis despite heavy alcohol intake (point prevalence of 1 percent for those who drink 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and 6 percent for those who drink 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>There are few specific therapies available for patients with alcoholic liver disease. There is, however, one extremely important intervention, abstinence, since continued alcohol ingestion is the single most important risk factor for progression of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Abstinence is also critical for those patients with cirrhosis to decrease the risk of complications. In addition, patients must be abstinent in order to be listed for liver transplantation. Referral to an alcohol rehabilitation program is usually necessary in combination with family support and counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial treatment of alcohol use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and general management of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis.

Not all patients who drink heavily develop alcoholic liver disease. However, once alcoholic liver disease develops, continued alcohol use typically leads to persistent and often progressive liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Factors associated with an increased risk of progression to cirrhosis include ongoing alcohol use, daily drinking rather than periodic binge drinking, cigarette smoking, obesity, female sex, and superimposed liver disease (eg, hepatitis B or C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. On the other hand, drinking with meals appears to decrease the risk of progression. Factors associated with increased mortality include ongoing alcohol use, increasing age, higher Child-Pugh score, presence of complications of cirrhosis (encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding), smoking, and coinfection with hepatitis B or C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>Histologic findings are also associated with patient outcomes. Hepatic inflammation (hepatitis) in patients with alcoholic liver disease increases the risk of progressing to cirrhosis and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The presence of inflammatory cells (particularly neutrophils) on a liver biopsy is associated with a worse prognosis, independent of other histologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. In one series, liver biopsies were examined in 217 consecutive patients with alcoholic liver disease (140 with cirrhosis) who were observed for five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with cirrhosis who had hepatitis (defined by the degree of inflammation and necrosis, as well as the presence of Mallory bodies) had significantly higher mortality rates than those without hepatitis (27 versus 7 percent at one year and 47 versus 31 percent at five years). Several additional histologic features have been described that are associated with a worse prognosis, including the presence of perivenular fibrosis and a mixed pattern of macrovesicular and microvesicular fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Among patients with alcoholic hepatitis, the Maddrey Discriminant Function Score and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score can be used to predict outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In patients who have not yet progressed to cirrhosis, abstinence may allow for reversal of the hepatic changes induced by alcohol. In patients with cirrhosis, alcohol abstinence decreases the risk of hepatic decompensation and improves survival. Patients should be referred for treatment for alcohol abuse or dependence to increase the likelihood of successful abstinence.

This was examined in a study that included 26 patients with alcoholic liver disease who had focal fatty lesions seen on computed tomographic (CT) scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. After abstaining from alcohol, all patients had changes in or resolution of the foci of fatty infiltration by six weeks (two patients had complete resolution within one week). In a second study, two patients who had steatosis demonstrated on liver biopsy in the setting of alcohol use were free of steatosis on biopsy one month after alcohol cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Among patients with fatty liver who continue to drink, patients who drink less alcohol have a better prognosis than those who drink more.

Of the 51 patients who consumed &ge;400 grams of alcohol per week, nine (18 percent) developed cirrhosis, and seven (14 percent) developed lesser degrees of fibrosis. However, a major limitation of the study is that the 49 patients who did not have histologic follow-up were assumed to be free from cirrhosis or fibrosis.</p><p>Abstinence can also be beneficial in patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis. Improvement in fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/19,20,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,35</a>], a reduction in or normalization of the portal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and resolution (or reduction) of ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] have accompanied alcohol abstinence in some patients.

Not all patients who drink heavily develop alcoholic liver disease. However, once alcoholic liver disease develops, continued alcohol use typically leads to persistent and often progressive liver disease. It is estimated that 8 to 20 percent of patients with alcoholic fatty liver will progress to develop alcoholic cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Natural history and prognostic factors'</a> above.) We recommend that patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis abstain from alcohol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In patients who have not yet progressed to cirrhosis, abstinence may allow for reversal of the hepatic changes induced by alcohol. In patients with cirrhosis, alcohol abstinence decreases the risk of hepatic decompensation and improves survival. Treatment for alcohol use disorders is essential to reduce the likelihood of continued abuse and liver damage. (See <a href=\"#H253571802\" class=\"local\">'Abstinence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholism is associated with nutritional deficiencies including protein calorie malnutrition and deficiencies of vitamins and trace minerals, so patients with alcoholic liver disease should undergo a nutritional assessment. Nutritional therapy is indicated for patients with alcoholic fatty liver who have evidence of malnutrition or vitamin or mineral deficiencies. We also suggest general nutritional therapy for all patients with cirrhosis, rather than a standard diet (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). General support in this setting consists of eating multiple times per day, including breakfast and a nighttime snack. The diet should consist of higher amounts of protein (1.2 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> and total calories (35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg)</span> than are recommended in a standard healthy diet. While nutritional therapy has not been shown to improve mortality in most randomized trials of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, it does appear to improve nitrogen balance and albumin levels, decrease hospitalization rates, and decrease the frequency of complications of cirrhosis (encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have decompensated liver disease despite alcohol abstinence should be referred to a liver transplantation center for evaluation. Some studies indicate that it may be possible to successfully perform liver transplantation without a period of abstinence in highly selected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications continue to be studied for the treatment of alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic cirrhosis. Some have shown promise, but additional high-quality trials are needed. (See <a href=\"#H62577331\" class=\"local\">'Experimental therapies'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bellentani S, Saccoccio G, Costa G, et al.
