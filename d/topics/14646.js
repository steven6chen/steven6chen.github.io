This form of PH (henceforth described as PH due to left heart disease [PH-LHD]) can occur in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), or HF caused by left-sided valvular disease. Recognition of PH-LHD is important because it is clearly associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]; however, therapeutic strategies beyond treatment of the underlying LHD have not been well-established. </p><p>The prevalence, pathogenesis, evaluation, prognosis, and treatment of PH-LHD are discussed here. Evaluation and management of patients with HF are discussed separately.

When all five groups are described collectively, the term PH is used. The term pulmonary arterial hypertension is used when referring to patients in group 1. Group 2 consists of patients with PH due to left heart disease (PH-LHD). A more detailed description of the classification of PH is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>PH has been defined as a resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &ge;25 mmHg on right heart catheterization. PH-LHD is defined hemodynamically as an mPAP &ge;25 mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) &ge;15 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>PH-LHD has been characterized by various descriptors in the medical literature with subsequent adoption of more standardized definitions. Older terms have included pulmonary venous hypertension, out-of-proportion PH, mixed PH, and passive versus reactive PH. This confusing terminology stems from the complex nature of PH-LHD, which encompasses both patients with elevated mPAP from passive transmission of increased left-sided filling pressures to the pulmonary circulation, as well as patients with superimposed pulmonary vascular disease. The recommended nomenclature to describe these two subgroups, respectively, are isolated post-capillary PH and combined post- and precapillary PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], as described below. (See <a href=\"#H2130573899\" class=\"local\">'Right heart catheterization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1467852874\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of PH due to left heart failure (PH-LHD) is not well defined, in part because of variations in study design, PH definitions, and diagnostic modalities employed. Most echo-based series suggest that 70 percent of PH is caused by LHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. PH-LHD occurs in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), or HF caused by left-sided valvular (mitral or aortic) disease.</p><p>Estimated prevalence rates for combined post- and precapillary PH (Cpc-PH) have been as high as 47 percent in patients with HFrEF with an acute decompensation and 69 percent in the HFpEF population in an outpatient registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, in a study that retrospectively examined 1063 patients with HF and prospectively followed an additional 391 patients, Cpc-PH identified by a diastolic pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (DPG) &ge;7 mmHg was present in only 12 percent of patients with HFrEF or HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although some have questioned the sensitivity of DPG for identification of Cpc-PH.</p><p>While estimates of PH in valvular heart disease also vary significantly, the Cpc-PH phenotype may similarly describe only a minority of patients. In one study of 317 patients with severe mitral stenosis undergoing percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty, 73 percent had a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &ge;25 mmHg, but only 19 percent had a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) &gt;15 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a single-center study of older adult patients with severe aortic stenosis, all of whom underwent right heart catheterization (RHC), 78 percent had PH, but only 12 percent had a DPG &ge;7 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The importance of mitral regurgitation as a cause of PH was shown in a study of 41 patients with isolated severe mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. PH was identified in 76 percent of patients, of which 17 percent had a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) &gt;70 mmHg on RHC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2011484501\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary hemodynamic insult that leads to isolated post-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) is an elevation in left atrial or ventricular filling pressures. Thus, for the majority of patients with PH due to left heart disease (PH-LHD), the elevation in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) can be considered a manifestation of heart failure (HF), with a normal pulmonary vascular response, though early remodeling of pulmonary arterioles and veins can still be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Increased left heart filling pressures can also reduce pulmonary arterial compliance promoting &quot;stiff&quot; pulmonary vasculature. This can lead to enhanced pulmonary wave reflections during systole and an elevated pulsatile load on the right ventricle (RV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Functional mitral regurgitation and loss of left atrial compliance are additional hemodynamic insults that can promote left atrial hypertension that transmits back to the pulmonary vasculature.</p><p>The subset of patients with PH-LHD with combined post- and precapillary PH (Cpc-PH) develops pulmonary arterial disease secondary to vasoconstriction and pathologic remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature. In patients with Cpc-PH, the elevation in mPAP is &quot;disproportionate&quot; to that generated by the transmission of increased left-sided filling pressures alone. There are scant histopathologic data in patients with PH-LHD (as compared with group 1 PH) and virtually none in patients with PH with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Histologically, these patients have vessels with evidence of medial hypertrophy, intimal fibrosis, and in-situ thrombosis, though plexiform lesions, a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are rarely seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Chronic contraction of the RV against an increased resistive afterload can ultimately lead to maladaptive hypertrophy, dilation, and subsequent contractile failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Cpc-PH patients may have a genetic predisposition to pulmonary arteriopathy in concert with LHD. In a study of 1456 patients with Ipc-PH, 312 patients with Cpc-PH, and 564 PAH patients, Cpc-PH and Ipc-PH patients had similar clinical characteristics and similar chronicity and severity of left ventricular dysfunction. However, 141 relevant genes were differentially expressed among PAH and Cpc-PH patients when compared with controls with Ipc-PH. These genes were expressed at higher levels in lung tissue and were enriched for biologic processes relevant to vascular remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H305128760\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2477403839\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PH due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) will typically present with symptoms and signs related to heart failure (HF). A detailed description of these features is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H431799179\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Initial panels'</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing isolated post-capillary PH, combined post- and precapillary PH (Cpc-PH), and LHD without PH is difficult based on history and physical examination alone. However, PH-LHD may progress along a clinical spectrum from a syndrome of isolated left HF with normal right ventricular (RV) function into a syndrome of right HF with jugular venous distension, ascites, peripheral edema, and echocardiographic findings that include a dilated and dysfunctional RV, interventricular septal flattening, and tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The following are symptoms and signs suggestive of right HF. Patients will often describe a history of dyspnea on minimal exertion. Anorexia and early satiety may result in unintentional weight loss (cardiac cachexia). Patients may experience substernal chest pressure as a result of RV subendocardial ischemia. Physical examination findings may include an accentuated pulmonic component (P2) of the second heart sound, a parasternal RV heave, a murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Exertional hypoxemia may be detected with bedside oximetry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2698564452\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial tests such as electrocardiography and chest radiography are not diagnostic of PH-LHD but may suggest RV dysfunction in some patients.</p><p>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly obtained in patients with HF to evaluate causes (eg, myocardial infarction) and detect associated abnormalities, such as arrhythmias. ECG findings in patients with PH-LHD are often nonspecific, but some patients may show findings suggestive of right HF such as RV hypertrophy, right bundle branch <span class=\"nowrap\">block,&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;a</span> rightward axis deviation. Presence of atrial fibrillation should also raise suspicion of right HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>A chest radiograph is commonly obtained in patients with PH-LHD to evaluate the cause of dyspnea. Patients with PH-LHD may have findings suggestive of HF such as cardiomegaly (cardiac-to-thoracic width ratio above 50 percent), cephalization of the pulmonary vessels, Kerley B-lines, and pleural effusions; some may have findings suggestive of RV enlargement. In patients with suspected PH-LHD, a chest radiograph may also be part of the initial evaluation to exclude concomitant lung disease.

In this situation, administration of 500 cc of saline within 5 to 10 minutes may unmask occult LHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2943941749\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative approach to saline infusion is provocative testing with exercise in the catheterization lab.

Thus, in patients with combined post- and precapillary PH, additional testing is recommended to exclude causes of PH other than LHD. (See <a href=\"#H3697104080\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> above.) </p><p>Three additional conditions that can be mistakenly identified as PH-LHD are PAH, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, and high-output HF. </p><p>PAH and PH from HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are frequently confused and can lead to the inappropriate use of specific PAH therapies for patients with left HF. Advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, coronary disease, and sleep-disordered breathing are all factors that are more commonly associated with HFpEF than PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Features on transthoracic echocardiography such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, and advanced diastolic dysfunction along with an absence of right ventricular (RV) dilation, RV dysfunction, or septal flattening also favor a diagnosis of HFpEF over PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When noninvasive evaluation is inconclusive, right heart catheterization with meticulous assessment of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) remains the clinical gold standard to clearly differentiate the two conditions. Exercise testing may also be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H2943941749\" class=\"local\">'Exercise testing'</a> above.)</p><p>Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare and unusual cause of PH. The pathologic hallmark of the disease is diffuse occlusion of the pulmonary veins by fibrous tissue. The triad of PH, <span class=\"nowrap\">pulmonary&nbsp;edema/effusions,&nbsp;and</span> normal PCWP, although not pathognomonic for the disease, is certainly suggestive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. By contrast, patients with PH-LHD have a PCWP &ge;15 mmHg. This condition is discussed in more detail separately.

In a study of 1384 HF patients, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) &gt;45 mmHg derived from transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was associated with increased five-year mortality, independent of the severity of diastolic and systolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, or cardiovascular comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In a study of 379 HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, all of whom underwent right heart catheterization, patients with PH and reduced RV systolic function had the worst prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, in a community-based study of 562 HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients, RV dysfunction was common and was independently associated with all-cause mortality.

Adequate decongestion with diuresis and other pharmacologic therapy is critical to reduce left-sided pressures and reduction of lung water may also improve pulmonary vascular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. As discussed separately, monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures with a wireless implantable hemodynamic system has been studied as a means of reducing HF-related hospitalizations.

For example, in a study of 559 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis undergoing percutaneous valvuloplasty, there was normalization of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) at six months regardless of baseline PH severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. LVAD therapy has also been shown to gradually improve mPAP in patients with HFrEF and a high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-patients-with-left-heart-failure/abstract/34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4226844167\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasodilator challenge as a guide for therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the role of a systemic vasodilator challenge has been most studied in heart transplant candidates as discussed below (see <a href=\"#H2717300151\" class=\"local\">'Management of heart transplant candidates'</a> below), we also utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> with or without inhaled nitric oxide during right heart catheterization in patients with severe mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation.

The mechanism for precapillary PH in these patients is more likely to be vasoconstriction or decreased compliance of the pulmonary vasculature and less likely to be pulmonary vascular remodeling or fibrosis. In patients with severe valvular regurgitation, this may identify a subset with a lower risk of residual PH or acute RV failure after valvular intervention or surgery. In patients with HFrEF or HFpEF, this can allow for better optimization of antihypertensives and afterload-reducing therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with persistent PH with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> alone (mPAP remains &gt;25 mmHg and TPG &gt;15 mmHg), but with an appropriate reduction in PCWP to &lt;15 mmHg, we will add inhaled nitric oxide at a dose of 20 to 40 ppm on top of continuous nitroprusside for 10 minutes and will then repeat another hemodynamic assessment. This may identify additional patients with a reversible precapillary component of PH. Also, a subsequent rise in PCWP with the addition of inhaled nitric oxide may predict an adverse response to the use of a pulmonary vasodilator. </p><p/><p>Notably, the presence of reversibility in Cpc-PH should not be confused with the reversibility that can classically be seen in a small subset of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There is no role for calcium channel blockers as a pulmonary vasodilator in Cpc-PH, and the association of reversibility with a better prognosis has not been clearly established outside of heart transplant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4223152361\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeted therapy for pulmonary hypertension</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793635921\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the available evidence, PH-targeted therapy (also known as advanced therapy for pulmonary hypertension) is not indicated for routine use in PH-LHD.

PH-LHD can occur in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), or HF caused by left-sided valvular disease.
