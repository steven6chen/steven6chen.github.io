Unhealthy alcohol use is an amount of alcohol consumed that places a person at risk for alcohol related events. Unhealthy alcohol consumption is a spectrum of alcohol consumption from risky alcohol consumption to alcohol use disorder. Patients with unhealthy alcohol use, with or without alcohol withdrawal syndrome, have an elevated risk of alcohol-associated medical and psychiatric problems, which if present can contribute to complications in the perioperative period. Alcohol consumption may interact with perioperative medications (eg, anesthetics, analgesics) and can contribute to compliance with postoperative treatment or postoperative recovery. </p><p>Patients anticipated to have surgery should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use. Those assessed with or suspected of having frequent heavy use could be encouraged to undergo medically supervised withdrawal prior to surgery and should be monitored closely for alcohol withdrawal syndrome during the perioperative surgical period. If surgery is needed urgently, or medically supervised withdrawal is refused by the patient, for patients suspected to have physical dependence on alcohol, they should be treated prophylactically with benzodiazepines (or other agents) to prevent alcohol withdrawal symptoms and its associated complications. The perioperative surgical period is an ideal time to identify and intervene on patients with unhealthy alcohol consumption. Patients with unhealthy drinking should always be educated about the consequences of their use and encouraged to participate in brief counseling or alcohol use disorder treatment, as appropriate.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, consequences, identification, and management of unhealthy alcohol use in patients who are undergoing surgical procedures. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder are described separately. The diagnosis and management of alcohol withdrawal are also described separately.

Patients with frequent and heavy alcohol use can, but not always, have physiologic dependence and have alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), which can contribute to morbidity directly and through increased complications of surgery or of treatment in the postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333688974\"><span class=\"h3\">Risky alcohol use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risky alcohol use refers to consumption of amounts of alcohol that places the patient at risk for health consequences. Acute and chronic conditions resulting from risky alcohol consumption include injuries, gastrointestinal bleeding, depression, sexually transmitted diseases, stroke, cancer, liver and heart disease, birth defects, perioperative complications, and alcohol use disorder. Many conditions that may occur or be exacerbated in patients who drink at risky levels may be further exacerbated by stress and treatment that naturally occur in patients in the perioperative period. For example, the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, dyspepsia, and ulcers in the perioperative period may be additive to these risks in patients who drink at risky alcohol amounts. </p><p>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in the United States has estimated consumption amounts of alcohol that increase health risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men under age 65 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More than 14 standard drinks per week on average </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More than 4 drinks on any day (or episode of drinking) in the last year</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women and all adults 65 years and older </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More than 7 drinks per week on average</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More than 3 drinks on any day (or episode of drinking) in the last year</p><p/><p>Amounts are based on a standard drink, which is defined as 12 grams of ethanol, 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of 80 proof spirits. The number and size of drinks used in these estimates vary internationally.</p><p>Specifying thresholds for risky alcohol use is an inexact science based on epidemiological evidence, and patients who drink just below these thresholds may have similar risks of those patients who drink just above these thresholds. While risky alcohol use is defined as a dichotomous &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; state, risks of a myriad of untoward health consequences are often delineated along a continuum of consumption amounts. </p><p>Patients with frequent heavy alcohol use are more likely to have a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, and are at increased perioperative risks from the medical consequences of alcohol use, as well as from physiologic dependence and potential withdrawal if alcohol is suddenly discontinued. Patients may have physical dependence on alcohol, with or without a formal diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3082707\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol use disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], alcohol use disorder (which replaced the DSM-IV disorders alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence) is characterized by a pattern of alcohol use associated with clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by multiple psychosocial, behavioral, or physiologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Physical dependence on alcohol is just one criterion for DSM-5 alcohol use disorder. Not all patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder have physiologic dependence on alcohol and may not require or need management of AWS. Patients with risky alcohol consumption may not have physical dependence on alcohol and not experience AWS. It is rare, however, for a patient not be physically dependent on alcohol without either consuming unhealthy alcohol amounts or having a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.

Acute physical stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased serum cortisol levels. Surgery is a known potent stimulus for HPA activation.

All preoperative patients should be assessed for quantity, frequency, and recency of alcohol use. This allows clinicians to anticipate operative and postoperative complications. </p><p>The primary function of screening in the preoperative period is to ensure that persons with unhealthy alcohol use are identified. If identified, practitioners should assess for risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorders and for potential physical alcohol dependence, which can cause alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Screening instruments and approaches to severity assessment are described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care#H2788947\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;, section on 'Screening tests'</a>.)</p><p>There exists several instruments to screen for unhealthy alcohol consumption that may be appropriate for use in the perioperative period. For example, we use the three-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) to screen for unhealthy alcohol use prior to surgery. A score of 5 or more in the year before surgery has been associated with increased postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An alternative is to screen with a single question: &quot;How many times in the past year have you had five or more drinks in a day (four for women)&quot;. A response of one or more indicates unhealthy use. Patients screening positive should be assessed for quantity, frequency, and recency of use. In addition, they should then be screened for alcohol use disorder, using standard instruments. </p><p>Patients with heavy drinking episodes (identifiable through the AUDIT-C or single screening question described above) are at risk of AWS. For such patients, they should be inquired about their last drink, the volume of recent consumption, and history of withdrawal symptoms. If they do have a history of withdrawal, they should be carefully questioned about their typical course of alcohol withdrawal including history of major consequences of withdrawal (eg, timing and duration of hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens).</p><p>Some patients may not disclose their alcohol consumption in the perioperative period (eg, due to fear of not having elective surgery), or may not be able to do so (eg, under sedation, unconscious). Inquiry to patterns of alcohol consumption should be made in a nonthreatening manner without fear of retribution or consequences to the patient. Surrogate interviews, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can provide information on alcohol consumption, signs and symptoms of unhealthy alcohol use, alcohol withdrawal, and resulting end-organ damage. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors that suggest possible physiologic alcohol dependence include presentation with alcohol intoxication or a detectable (and particularly a high) blood or breath alcohol level or a past history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Regardless, patients with significant alcohol consumption may have impairment of INR and liver enzymes causing potential perioperative bleeding problems or drug interactions. In particular, reduced hepatic metabolism that may complicate perioperative anesthetic and analgesic management. </p><p/><p>All patients with known or suspected unhealthy alcohol use, particularly those with recent and frequent heavy drinking, should be systematically assessed for <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of AWS using a validated instrument such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64835 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The psychiatric diagnoses in DSM-IV-TR, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, were replaced by one diagnosis, alcohol use disorder, in DSM-5. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, alcohol dependence is approximately comparable to the moderate to severe subtype of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse is comparable to a mild alcohol use disorder.

There is some evidence of benefits to this approach. A randomized trial of 42 patients with daily heavy drinking compared alcohol use disorder treatment (800 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disulfiram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disulfiram</a> twice weekly to achieve and maintain abstinence) with no treatment one month before surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Abstinence was associated with fewer postoperative complications. </p><p>Alcohol use disorder treatment begins can begin with medically supervised withdrawal or prophylaxis, if needed, and typically includes addiction counseling and mutual help group participation; it may include other psychosocial interventions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medication. Brief intervention is an option for patients without moderate to severe alcohol use disorder and as an initial approach for anyone with unhealthy alcohol use.

As an example, in a clinical trial, 3139 patients scheduled to undergo elective inpatient surgery were screened to identify 136 patients with unhealthy alcohol use; they were randomly assigned to receive a customized brief intervention or to a control condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. At six months' follow-up assessment both groups experienced a reduction in drinking; they did not differ in the amount consumed or in postoperative complications.

The patient&rsquo;s need for surgery can be a powerful motivator for modifying behaviors that may have contributed to health consequences. </p><p>Preoperative consultation with a healthcare provider with addiction expertise (eg, addiction psychiatrist, addiction medicine clinician) may be useful, depending on the treating physician&rsquo;s knowledge and experience treating alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). The consultant would interview the patient, identify the presence and extent of unhealthy alcohol use, determine risk of withdrawal, develop a plan with the patient to minimize alcohol-related surgical morbidity, and review treatment options. Frequent contact with the specialist and the patient in the perioperative period may enhance outcomes (eg, length of stay, use of benzodiazepines), but further research in this area is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3084061\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing/treating withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with recent history of known or suspected frequent heavy alcohol use require ongoing monitoring for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and treatment, if present, with a cross-tolerant medication. Patients with risky alcohol use but no recent frequent heavy use and those without physiological dependence do not need supervised withdrawal or prophylaxis prior to alcohol use disorder treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3085118\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p>We suggest benzodiazepines for the prevention or treatment of withdrawal rather than other medications. Benzodiazepines have been found to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms and incidence of delirium and seizures more effectively and safely than other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. We recommend that ethanol not be used to treat symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Study of ethanol for this purpose has been limited; it is difficult to titrate, has been associated with surgical and medical complications (eg, anemia and hepatic enzyme elevations) and end-organ effects, and is less efficacious compared with benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Beyond benzodiazepines, there exists other pharmacologic treatments of AWS, but at the time of this writing, they are the preferred agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;, section on 'Alternative and contraindicated agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085229\"><span class=\"h4\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with known or suspected frequent or heavy alcohol use need ongoing monitoring to detect the emergence of signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Use of a validated instrument such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar), a measure of withdrawal severity, is suggested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64835 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Identifying alcohol withdrawal accurately in patients during or following surgery can be challenging, and often assessment using validated instruments of AWS (eg, CIWA-Ar) are imprecise. As an example, patients may not be able to communicate, and other perioperative signs and symptoms (eg, tremulousness, <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/sweat)</span> may impart a falsely high reading on the CIWA-Ar instrument. Administration of CIWA-Ar in the postoperative period may be complicated by endotracheal intubation, decreased level of consciousness, or inability to communicate with the assessor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presentation of alcohol withdrawal can be similar to manifestations of the stress responses; difficulty differentiating between the two syndromes can delay time to recognition of withdrawal, increasing the morbidity of patients with physiologic dependence on alcohol. The preoperative evaluation for potential unhealthy alcohol use and potential for AWS may inform the differentiation. In patients with suspected (but uncertain) unhealthy alcohol use, the clinician can provide AWS prophylaxis and low-dose AWS pharmacotherapy while monitoring physical signs and their response to treatment until the patient is able to communicate. </p><p>Emerging AWS symptoms days after the surgery may tip the clinician to institute full AWS treatment. In all patients with AWS symptoms postoperatively who are unable or unwilling to be assessed for their preoperative alcohol consumption, preoperative unhealthy alcohol consumption and AWS should be considered. As an example, postoperative delirium is common and can present similarly regardless of whether due to alcohol withdrawal or other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59943 \">table 3</a>). The clinician must consider a differential diagnosis that includes cardiovascular, endocrine, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, oncologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, and medication-related causes. </p><p>Because patients with unhealthy alcohol use may be at risk for or have medical and mental health conditions associated with their use, these conditions could be exacerbated in the postoperative period. (See <a href=\"#H8113770\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol-related complications'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Medically supervised withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients experiencing AWS prior to surgery need to undergo medically supervised alcohol withdrawal. Treatment with a benzodiazepine is administered when withdrawal symptoms occur. Dosing is based on the severity of symptoms. Supervised alcohol withdrawal is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For severe AWS and delirium tremens, a preferred regimen is to give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 5 to 10 mg IV for moderate to severe symptoms, repeated every 5 to 10 minutes until symptoms are controlled. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> may also be used (2 to 4 mg IV, repeated every 15 to 20 minutes). Lorazepam, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> or oral diazepam should be used for milder cases. The choice of oral versus parenteral medication depends in large part on ability to take oral medication. The dosing of benzodiazepines in medically supervised alcohol withdrawal should be guided by using a validated assessment tool, such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64835 \">table 2</a>). This requires formally assessing patients at regular intervals.

In benzodiazepine prophylaxis, the medication is given to asymptomatic, at-risk patients to prevent withdrawal symptoms. This may also be beneficial for patients whose preoperative alcohol consumption is not known. In this case, a long-acting, low-dose benzodiazepine can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.).</p><p>We favor administering prophylaxis to any patient suspected of frequent heavy alcohol use. This is particularly important in such patients whose alcohol consumption is not known because of perioperative pain, sedation, or intubation. In these cases, it is important to ask family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> friends about the patient&rsquo;s consumption as well as to be attentive to AWS symptomatology that may develop.
