The increased risk of fracture has been reported with doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent as low as 2.5 to 7.5 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Glucocorticoids increase bone resorption and reduce bone formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67048\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67048 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The risk of bone loss is most pronounced in the first few months of use, followed by slower but steady loss of bone with continued use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most agents that increase bone loss, such as thyroxine or sustained elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH), accelerate not only bone resorption but also formation, albeit to a lesser extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because glucocorticoids accelerate resorption while inhibiting formation, their use is associated with early rapid bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. With chronic use, osteoclast-mediated bone resorption slows, and suppression of bone formation becomes the predominant skeletal effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increase in bone resorption</strong> &ndash; As in other target tissues, glucocorticoids exert their effects on gene expression via cytoplasmic glucocorticoid type 2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In adult bone, functional glucocorticoid receptors are found in <span class=\"nowrap\">preosteoblast/stromal</span> cells, osteoblasts (the cells that produce bone matrix), but not in osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Glucocorticoids stimulate osteoclast proliferation by suppressing synthesis of osteoprotegerin, an inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic cells of the macrophage lineage, and by stimulating production of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK), which is required for osteoclastogenesis. High glucocorticoid levels also stimulate RANK ligand (RANKL) synthesis by <span class=\"nowrap\">preosteoblast/stromal</span> cells, supporting osteoclast differentiation and net bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, glucocorticoids increase bone resorption by decreasing secretion of androgens and estrogens, mediated primarily by inhibition of gonadotropin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

The decline in bone formation is mediated by direct inhibition of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and by an increase in the apoptosis rates of mature osteoblasts and osteocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/2,3,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,22-24</a>].

In addition, glucocorticoids alter PTH secretory dynamics (reduce tonic secretion and increase the amount released as pulses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], antagonize the anabolic action of PTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>], and inhibit production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/3,24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,28</a>] and testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

In another cross-sectional study of 32 adults treated with glucocorticoids since childhood for 21-hydroxylase deficiency, bone density was significantly lower at the femoral neck than in the reference population, likely due to slight overtreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Studies have not found consistent results regarding the impact of inhaled glucocorticoids on risk of osteoporosis and of osteoporotic fracture. This could relate to the fact that patients randomized to inhaled glucocorticoids tend to need fewer courses of systematic glucocorticoids, so that a mild, direct, deleterious effect of high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids could be masked by the benefit of reducing the need for systemic glucocorticoids. Topical therapy (eg, inhaled glucocorticoids) is preferred over enteral or parenteral glucocorticoids whenever possible. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H670770520\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are the same as those of other causes of osteoporosis. Most often, there are no clinical manifestations until there is a fracture. Vertebral fractures are most common, and they are often asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H2397063\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient taking any dose of glucocorticoid with an anticipated duration of &ge;3 months requires an evaluation. The goal of the evaluation is to identify patients at high risk for fracture who would benefit from intervention. Assessment of fracture risk within six months of initiating glucocorticoids should include evaluation of clinical risk factors for fracture and, in selected patients, BMD (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) of the hip and spine. (See <a href=\"#H2397070\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We measure BMD (DXA) of the hip and spine in adults &ge;40 years of age taking any dose of glucocorticoid with anticipated duration of &ge;3 months. For adults &lt;40 years, we typically measure BMD if they are taking high doses (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &ge;20 mg daily or its equivalent for more than one month) or anticipate long duration (eg, as for some inflammatory diseases). We also measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to guide vitamin D supplementation. Additional laboratory evaluation depends upon the results of the BMD study. (See <a href=\"#H1209450818\" class=\"local\">'BMD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients <strong>without</strong> established osteoporosis (eg, the absence of prior fragility fracture or BMD T-score &le;-2.5), fracture risk can be quantitated using a fracture prediction tool, such as <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=FWNID0ZRoEvvwjKjY4KwHRcJtKEvPJpqM2LM0KvUOZmbLheqeTtnW9T2nrw6ABgh&amp;TOPIC_ID=2032\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX</a> (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool). (See <a href=\"#H1120793263\" class=\"local\">'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom the decision to administer pharmacologic therapy for fracture prevention is uncertain (eg, low bone mass [T-score between -1.0 and -2.5], no known prior fracture, but strong family history of osteoporosis), we obtain imaging of the spine. Imaging may be performed with conventional radiography or with vertebral fracture assessment (VFA), a component of the DXA instrument. The presence of a vertebral fracture is a strong predictor of future fractures of all types and is an indication for pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H348100959\" class=\"local\">'Vertebral imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are presented separately.
