As an example, a 2004 study that analyzed first renal transplants performed between 1995 and 2000 found that, despite a reduction in acute rejection rates, there was no improvement over the last 10 years in long-term allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite this, the rate of decline in kidney allograft function appears to have slowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], suggesting that improved results relating to long-term allograft survival are possible.</p><p>Allograft survival rates also vary among different ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This may be explained in part by the presence of a disproportionately higher number of risk factors among certain patient populations and differences in access to health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].</p><p>The following discussion will review the determinants of short-term and long-term graft survival. However, this distinction is to some degree arbitrary since most factors can affect both. As an example, any short-term event that predisposes to episodes of acute rejection will then lead to a greater likelihood of chronic graft loss. In addition, many of these factors influence each other, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatching, which may increase the risk of acute renal rejection and subsequent premature allograft failure. A discussion of patient survival after renal transplantation is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of graft loss has traditionally been divided into an early, high-risk period and a later period of constant low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A major improvement in renal allograft survival in the past 20 years has been the relative elimination of the early risk period.</p><p>A number of factors have been shown to influence short-term graft survival. These include delayed allograft function, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, type of donor kidney, donor illness, medical center factors, and other factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed allograft function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of delayed graft function has a major adverse impact upon both short- and long-term allograft survival. In one single-center study of 518 patients, multivariate analysis found that delayed graft function was the principal factor underlying kidney survival at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; by comparison, acute rejection, HLA matching, degree of sensitization, and retransplantation did not significantly affect short-term survival.</p><p>Issues surrounding delayed allograft function and long-term allograft survival are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tissue injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Human leukocyte antigen antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some data suggest that the presence of HLA antibodies is associated with an increased risk of early graft loss. Based upon data from nearly 5000 patients, the frequency of HLA antibodies was 21 percent among renal transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Over 2000 patients were followed prospectively, with 91 grafts failing and 34 deaths. The risk of allograft failure at one year was significantly higher among those with HLA antibodies (6.6 versus 3.3 percent), as well as among those who developed such antibodies de novo (8.6 versus 3 percent).</p><p>In addition, such antibodies place patients awaiting transplantation at a significant disadvantage as their waiting time for an allograft is markedly prolonged and they are at increased risk of both delayed graft function and rejection in the perioperative period. Some of these issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and ABO sensitization and desensitization in renal transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of HLA antibodies also has an adverse effect upon long-term allograft survival. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Human leukocyte antigen matching'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is generally acknowledged that not all kidneys for transplantation are created equal. Such organs have long been characterized by donor source, whether living or deceased. Living-donor transplants have a greater short-term survival rate than deceased-donor kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Allograft survival rates for living-donor transplants and deceased, non-expanded-criteria donors (ECDs) are 98 versus 96 percent at three months and 96 versus 92 percent at one year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A graft survival benefit with living transplants is also observed with second allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This difference reflects the optimal circumstances surrounding living, related donation compared with the potentially injurious effect of deceased-donor donation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tissue injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to 2014, deceased donors were categorized as standard-criteria donors (SCDs) or ECDs. ECD kidneys are from brain-dead donors that are further defined by an increase of 1.7 in relative risk of premature graft failure within the first year posttransplant. Such kidneys derive from donors &gt;60 years of age, as well as those with a history of hypertension or stroke as the cause of death. ECD kidneys are associated with decreased short-term allograft survival, particularly among those undergoing retransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>However, the utility of this rudimentary classification was limited by the presence of substantial overlap in outcomes and kidney quality since the ECD category is broad and nonuniform and includes kidneys that are likely to have different outcomes. As an example, the ECD category would include both a perfectly healthy 60 year old with a normal serum creatinine and a 55 year old with diabetes, hypertension, and a creatinine of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p>A central feature of the revised kidney allocation system, which was implemented in the United States in 2014, is the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI), which is a continuous, rather than a dichotomous, index of the quality of donor kidneys, from the highest quality, with the longest projected functional lifetime after transplant, to the lowest quality, with the shortest projected functional lifetime (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96282 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The more granular KDPI, based solely on donor characteristics, combines a variety of donor risk factors for graft failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F88376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88376 \">table 1</a>) into a single number. In one study that used the KDPI (or Kidney Donor Risk Index [KDRI]) to classify deceased-donor kidneys, the highest quintile (with highest risk for graft failure or lowest projected survival) had a calculated five-year survival of 63 percent compared with those in the lowest two risk quintiles, which had projected five-year survivals of 82 and 79 percent, respectively. The KDPI system overlapped with the <span class=\"nowrap\">ECD/SCD</span> system in that the percentage of ECD kidneys rose with increasing risk quintile. However, 32 percent of ECD kidneys studied had KDRI less than the 85<sup>th</sup> percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

This appears to be a consistent finding that has been observed over the last few decades, a period of increasingly effective immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Possible underlying reasons include center volume and differences in long-term patient management experience. Center-specific data are compulsorily reported to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) as public information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H567502790\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing donor age is associated with inferior survival of allografts from deceased donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In an analysis of 6490 deceased-donor kidney transplants identified from the UK transplant registry, compared with donor age &lt;40 years, donor age &gt;60 years was associated with increased risk of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR] 2.35, 95% CI 1.85-3.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deceased-donor allograft survival may also vary by the cause of donor death <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> history of specific comorbid illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/15,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29</a>]. As an example, kidneys transplanted from stroke victims had lower one-year allograft survival rates than seen overall with deceased-donor renal transplantation (79 versus 84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysis and preemptive transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early allograft survival may vary with the use of maintenance dialysis and perhaps the type of dialysis prior to transplantation. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM SURVIVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The identification of clinical risk factors for long-term allograft failure has been provided by several studies performed in the current immunosuppressive era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation (ALERT) trial, for example, 2000 patients were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvastatin</a> or placebo and followed for five to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In the placebo group, allograft loss was noted in 137 patients, which was principally caused by chronic allograft nephropathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic renal allograft nephropathy&quot;</a>). With multivariate analysis, independent baseline risk factors for enhanced risk of allograft loss included increased serum creatinine concentration (relative risk [RR] of 3.12 per every increase of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> proteinuria (RR of 1.6 per every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> and pulse pressure (RR of 1.12 per every increase of 10 mmHg).</p><p>An additional possible marker for enhanced risk of poor long-term survival is decreased renal function at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In one study, there was a progressive decline in allograft half-life for each incremental increase in the serum creatinine concentration at six months and at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The exact mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic allograft dysfunction leading to long-term graft loss are unknown. Both alloantigen-dependent and independent factors are thought to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Long-term graft survival is generally measured in terms of the half-life, which is defined as the time beyond the first year posttransplant at which 50 percent of grafts are no longer functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Alloantigen-dependent factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic rejection and allograft loss are more likely to develop in patients with a history of acute rejection, a greater degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatching, infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. These observations are consistent with an important role for immunologic or alloantigen-dependent injury in the subsequent development of chronic allograft dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic renal allograft nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Episodes of acute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of acute rejection episodes are more likely to have late allograft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. This was shown in a study of 63,045 primary renal recipients in which an acute rejection episode in 1996 to 1997 was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk for chronic allograft nephropathy compared with no rejection in a reference group from 1988 to 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Human leukocyte antigen matching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased degree of HLA antigen mismatching is associated with a greater risk of chronic graft loss, presumably due to ongoing specific immunologic injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When organ allocation is based upon HLA typing, one concern is the effect of cold ischemia time upon long-term survival. The beneficial effect of HLA matching appears to generally outweigh the detrimental effect of prolonging the cold ischemia time in transported kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The current registry data indicate that the five-year graft survival of six-antigen-matched cadaver kidneys is the same regardless of whether the kidneys undergo 3 or 36 hours of cold ischemia.</p><p>However, a deleterious effect of prolonged cold ischemia time becomes evident in recipients of mismatched grafts. A stepwise reduction of 1 to 2 percent in survival has been observed in association with incremental 12-hour increases in cold ischemia time. The adverse effect of cold ischemia can also be observed when allograft survival is compared between the recipients of a first deceased donor transplanted and the recipient of the second donor kidney transplanted (mean of 19.9 versus 25.6 hours cold ischemia time) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The 5- and 10-year survival was 72 and 55 percent for the first kidney transplanted, respectively, compared with 65 and 40 percent for the second kidney transplanted.</p><p>Insight into the relative contributions to allograft survival of HLA matching and cold ischemia time is also provided by examining the graft survival rates of living, unrelated kidneys. Graft survival rates of kidneys donated by a spouse are very similar to those of kidneys donated by family members with a one-haplotype mismatch (half-life of 12 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. If HLA mismatching were the only factor affecting graft survival, the living, unrelated grafts should have poorer long-term survival, possibly in the range of randomly matched cadaver grafts (which generally have approximately three HLA mismatches and an average half-life of 8.4 years).</p><p>Thus, both cold ischemia time and HLA matching exert important effects upon long-term graft survival. However, six-antigen matching completely overcomes the effect of ischemia, and lesser degrees of matching (even in the presence of ischemia) yield superior results than zero-antigen-matched kidneys. Changes in allograft immunogenicity induced by tissue injury prior to death in cadaveric transplants also may contribute to the lower long-term survival with cadaveric as opposed to living-donor kidneys. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tissue injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies against HLA class I (A, B, C) or class II (DR, DQ) are found in subjects who have been immunized to these glycoproteins by pregnancy, blood transfusion, or a prior HLA-mismatched allograft. Highly sensitized patients have a decreased statistical chance of being transplanted because of the high likelihood of a positive pretransplant crossmatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Increases in sensitization to lymphocyte antigens, as measured by the panel reactive antibody (PRA) status, incrementally augment the risk of graft loss. Five-year deceased-donor non-expanded criteria donor (ECD) allograft survival rates in the 2007 Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) annual report were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seventy-one percent for patients with a PRA of 0 to 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty-nine percent with a PRA of 10 to 79 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty-nine percent with a PRA of &gt;80 percent</p><p/><p>In a large retrospective analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry, the 10-year allograft survival rate was 44 percent among highly sensitized patients (PRA &ge;98 percent), compared with 52 percent among nonsensitized patients (PRA = 0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>It is increasingly appreciated that the presence of preformed HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) has an adverse effect upon allograft outcomes. Using very sensitive HLA-specific assays, allograft survival at eight years was evaluated among 43 patients with and 194 patients without preformed DSAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Allograft survival was 68 versus 77 percent for those with and without DSAs, respectively, while the incidence of antibody-mediated rejection was ninefold higher in those with preformed DSAs.</p><p>Complement-binding HLA DSAs, in particular, are associated with decreased graft survival. This was shown in a study of 1016 patients who received a kidney transplant at two centers between 2005 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. All patients were tested for circulating HLA DSAs using stored serum samples, which were obtained at the time of transplantation and at the time of allograft biopsy (which was performed either at one year after transplantation or during an episode of acute rejection during the first year after transplantation). Serum samples of patients who were found to have HLA DSAs were further tested for the presence of C1q-binding HLA DSAs using a single-antigen flow bead assay. Overall, patients with HLA DSAs had worse five-year graft survival compared with those who did not have such antibodies (83 versus 94 percent, respectively). Patients with C1q-binding DSA HLA antibodies (n = 77) had worse graft survival compared with patients with non-C1q-binding DSA HLA antibodies (n = 239) and compared with patients without DSA HLA antibodies (n = 770; 54 versus 93 and 94 percent, respectively). After adjusting for multiple clinical, functional, histologic, and other immunologic factors, the presence of C1q-binding DSA HLA was associated with a greater than fourfold increased risk of graft loss (hazard ratio [HR] 4.78, 95% CI 2.69-8.49). C1q-binding antibodies were also associated with an increased rate of antibody-mediated rejection and increased C4d deposition in the allograft. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection#H2347586386\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;, section on 'Detection of donor-specific antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>However, the C1q-binding assay is not widely used and has not been validated in other institutions. Furthermore, it is likely that there are some noncomplement-binding DSAs that are clinically relevant in graft failure and will not be detected by this assay.</p><p>Limited data suggest that sensitization may, in some cases, represent non-HLA immunity, with increased levels associated with decreased survival. As an example, a retrospective study of over 4000 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants evaluated the long-term survival in association with PRA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Given that these transplants were between HLA-identical siblings, the presence of PRA was thought to represent antibodies against HLA antigens not found in the transplanted kidney. However, 10-year survival was highest among those with no PRA (72 percent) versus those with either 1 to 50 percent PRA (63 percent) or &gt;50 percent PRA (56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This suggests that non-HLA transplantation immunity, as detected by PRA, may have a role in long-term allograft survival.</p><p>The importance of non-HLA immunity was further supported by a two-year prospective study of 2231 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

This correlation likely reflects the presence of ischemia-reperfusion lesions, ongoing <span class=\"nowrap\">immunologic/nonimmunologic</span> allograft injuries, and other pathogenic processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14813848\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIMIZING OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation factors affect graft survival after transplantation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretransplantation &ndash; The goal of the transplant team is to engraft as many recipients as possible while minimizing complications that impact graft and patient survival. Unfortunately, such goals may be at variance. As an example, the increased use of expanded-criteria donors (ECDs) can increase the number of transplants performed while negatively impacting graft survival. Thus, a key part of the organ selection process potentially is to balance such variables by providing secondary benefits such as reducing waiting time for those who agree to receive such grafts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transplant programs should also consider patient selection criteria as important predictors of outcome. For example, transplanting a higher proportion of &quot;high-risk&quot; candidates will adversely impact survival rates. Such case mix-adjusted information is tracked by both the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritransplantation &ndash; Minimizing cold and warm ischemia time is an attractive target for reducing the risk of delayed graft function and decreased graft survival. In truth, delays in organ allocation and transportation are logistic realities over which programs often have little control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttransplantation &ndash; Careful titration of immunosuppression is essential following transplantation. Minimizing rejection rates must be balanced against the risk of infection. Addressing comorbidities such as hypertension and dyslipidemia may improve long-term outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18182802\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are multiple determinants of short-term and long-term graft survival; most factors can affect both. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major factors that decrease short-term graft survival include delayed allograft function and the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. In addition, living-donor transplants have a greater short-term survival rate than deceased-donor kidneys. Kidneys classified in the lowest quintile of the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) have the shortest projected functional lifetime (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96282 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Donor illness, cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity, and factors related to the transplant medical center may also play a role. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Short-term survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early allograft survival may vary with the use of maintenance dialysis and perhaps the type of dialysis prior to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis and preemptive transplantation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late allograft failure is increased in patients with delayed graft function, HLA mismatching, cold ischemia time, the development of anti-HLA antibodies, and inadequate immunosuppressive therapy. The beneficial effect of HLA matching outweighs the detrimental effect of prolonging the cold ischemia time in transported kidneys. Preformed HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) are associated with decreased allograft survival and may represent non-HLA immunity in some cases. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Alloantigen-dependent factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alloantigen-independent factors contribute to decreased graft survival. Such factors include inadequate renal mass, prior and ongoing tissue injury, noncompliance, posttransplant hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a more marginal kidney, calcineurin toxicity, CMV seropositivity, and recurrent or de novo glomerular disease. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Alloantigen-independent factors'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hariharan S, Johnson CP, Bresnahan BA, et al.
