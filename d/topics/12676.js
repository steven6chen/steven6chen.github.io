VTE contributes to significant morbidity and mortality both in the community and in hospital. The mainstay of therapy for DVT is anticoagulation, provided there is no contraindication. Following initial anticoagulation, patients with DVT are anticoagulated further to prevent future recurrences, embolism, and thrombosis-related death.</p><p>An overview of the treatment of lower extremity DVT (distal and proximal), including indications for anticoagulation, alternate therapies, and treatment of special populations of patients with DVT, are discussed in this topic. Initial, long-term, and extended (indefinite) anticoagulation for DVT, as well as the treatment of PE, upper extremity DVT, and the diagnosis and prevention of DVT, are discussed in detail separately.

In contrast, a provoked DVT is one that is usually caused by a known event (eg, surgery, hospital admission). VTE events can be provoked by transient major risk factors (ie, major surgery &gt;30 minutes, hospitalization or immobility &ge;3 days, Cesarean section), transient minor risk factors (minor surgery &lt;30 minutes, hospitalization &lt;3 days, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility &ge;3 days) or persistent risk factors. Persistent risk factors include reversible conditions (eg, curable malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease that resolves) and irreversible conditions such as inheritable thrombophilias, chronic heart failure, and metastatic end-stage malignancy.

Long-term anticoagulant therapy is typically administered for a finite time beyond the initial period, usually three to six months, and occasionally up to 12 months. Extended anticoagulation refers to therapy that is administered indefinitely.

Throughout this topic, we refer to these agents by their pharmacologic class, direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors.

Anticoagulation is indicated for all patients with proximal DVT and select cases of distal DVT. The decision to anticoagulate must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation against the risk of bleeding for an individual. The primary objective of anticoagulation is the prevention of further thrombosis and of early and late complications. Major early complications of DVT include further clot extension, acute pulmonary embolus (PE), major bleeding (from anticoagulation), and death. Late complications include recurrent clot, post-thrombotic (post phlebitic) syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-thrombotic (postphlebitic) syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The indication to anticoagulate is stronger for patients with proximal DVT (popliteal, femoral, iliac vein) than with distal DVT (calf vein) because the risk of complications is higher, especially embolization and death. As an example, older studies reported that over 90 percent of acute PE arise from the proximal veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Another prospective analysis of 1643 patients anticoagulated for acute DVT (OPTIMEV) reported that the mortality rate of proximal DVT is higher than that of distal DVT (8 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The indications to anticoagulate are based upon a definitive diagnosis of DVT, usually made on compressive ultrasound (CUS) of the lower extremities. In patients with asymptomatic proximal or distal DVT found incidentally by another imaging modality, usually computed tomography (CT), the diagnosis should be sought using CUS before anticoagulation due to the poorer sensitivity and specificity of CT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity#H1036971809\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic ultrasonography suspected first DVT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal DVT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal lower extremity DVT is thrombus that is located in the popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77469 \">table 1</a>). Anticoagulant therapy is indicated for all patients with proximal DVT, regardless of the presence of symptoms and provided there is no contraindication to anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F97117\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97117 \">algorithm 1</a>). This approach is supported by a seminal randomized trial that demonstrated a survival benefit with anticoagulation as well as randomized trials and meta-analyses of patients treated with variable durations of anticoagulant therapy.</p><p>Accurate estimates of recurrent thrombosis and death in patients with proximal DVT who are not treated with anticoagulant therapy are unknown. In the seminal trial, performed in 1960, that compared anticoagulation with observation in patients with acute DVT, anticoagulation resulted in a dramatic reduction in recurrence, which translated into a mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since then, most other trials have compared various doses and durations of anticoagulant therapy for DVT to provide an estimate of the risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Nonetheless, these data all support low rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and death in patients treated with anticoagulant therapy for proximal DVT, with the greatest benefit occurring within the first few days or weeks of the initial event. As an example, one 2010 meta-analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies and 56 randomized clinical trials reported rates of recurrent VTE and fatal VTE during the first three months of anticoagulant therapy as 3.4 and 0.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>For patients with proximal DVT, the absence of symptoms (ie, incidental proximal DVT) does not alter the indication for anticoagulation. Although the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in patients with asymptomatic proximal vein DVT compared with symptomatic DVT is unknown, we and others prefer that this population of patients be managed in the same manner as symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This preference is based upon the rationale that proximal DVT has a high risk of embolization and upon indirect evidence from patients with symptomatic proximal DVT that report a reduction in the risk of recurrence with anticoagulation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal DVT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated distal DVT encompasses thromboses located below the knee in the calf veins (ie, the popliteal vein is not involved). Most calf vein DVTs are located in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins while anterior tibial and muscular vein DVTs are uncommon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77469 \">table 1</a>). Notably, isolated distal DVT <strong>cannot</strong> be detected by routine proximal vein compression ultrasonography (proximal CUS) and although it can be detected by whole leg ultrasonography, the latter is difficult to perform and interpret and its use is institution-dependent; thus, to overcome this disadvantage serial proximal CUS can be used to detect thrombus that extends into the proximal veins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The treatment of isolated distal DVT varies among centers and clinicians and represents a major challenge therapeutically. While some experts prefer that all patients with isolated distal DVT be anticoagulated, we and other experts agree that a select minority can avoid anticoagulation. This preference is based upon the rationale that patients with isolated distal DVT are at lower risk of embolization (approximately half the risk) than those with proximal DVT and that in some patients, the distal DVTs resolve spontaneously without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-21</a>]. When the decision is made to anticoagulate patients with isolated distal DVT, full therapeutic anticoagulation should be administered similar to those with proximal DVT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H310146110\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While in the past whole leg ultrasound frequently identified asymptomatic patients with isolated distal DVT, a shift towards presentation with symptomatic DVT has occurred such that we and others use symptoms as well as other clinical features to help us decide who to treat. In general, the following indications for anticoagulation apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic</strong> &ndash; In general, most clinicians agree that anticoagulation is indicated in most patients with <strong>symptomatic</strong> isolated distal DVT, provided the risk of bleeding is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22-24</a>]. However, some experts choose not to treat select patients who are considered a very low risk of embolization and are suitable candidates for surveillance; such patients include those with minor thrombosis in the muscular veins, those with a negative D-dimer level, those with nondiagnostic ultrasonography results, those with minor symptoms who are without risk factors for extension (see list in &quot;Asymptomatic&quot; bullet, below), and those at high risk of bleeding.

As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural history studies suggest that when left untreated, approximately one-third of patients with symptomatic isolated distal DVT will develop extension into the proximal veins, most often within the first two weeks after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/10-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One meta-analysis that included two randomized and six nonrandomized cohort studies of patients with isolated distal DVT reported that, compared with those who were followed with serial ultrasound, proximal thrombus propagation was less likely to occur in those receiving anticoagulation (odds ratio [OR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.14-0.62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the methodologic quality of most studies was poor and the number of outcome events that occurred (ie, deaths, PE, proximal DVT extension, bleeding) was small, which limited the analysis. A similar meta-analysis reported a reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE (OR 0.5) in those who were anticoagulated without an increased risk in the rate of bleeding (OR 0.64) compared with those who did not receive anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505990327\"><span class=\"h3\">Surveillance with serial ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Select patients with isolated distal DVT may be subjected to surveillance with serial ultrasound to look for extension of lower extremity clot into the proximal veins.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Distal DVT'</a> above.)</p><p>Support for this approach is derived from studies that suggest that the risk of embolization in patients with isolated distal DVT is low and approximately half that of proximal DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As an example, several retrospective and prospective observational studies reported that limited thrombosis confined to the muscular veins, compared with extensive thrombosis of multiple calf veins, appears to have a low risk of extension without therapy (about 3 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9-12,14,17,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12,14,17,18,23</a>].

Patients, especially those on direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors and those &gt;75 years, should also be assessed for the signs and symptoms of conditions that may affect the half-life of the administered anticoagulant (eg, renal failure, weight loss, pregnancy). In all patients, the decision to anticoagulate should be individualized and the benefits of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention carefully weighed against the risk of bleeding. Absolute and relative contraindications to anticoagulation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H256309218\" class=\"local\">'Patients with contraindications to anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p>The administration of anticoagulation is always associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which is in turn dependent upon the degree of anticoagulation and the presence of pre-existing factors for bleeding. Tools are available for estimating the risk of bleeding in anticoagulated individuals (eg, HAS-BLED score) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-clinical-characteristics-comprising-the-has-bled-bleeding-risk-score-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). However, none of these tools has been validated in patients anticoagulated for VTE and no one index can reliably predict bleeding risk in a particular patient such that for practical purposes, many clinicians use a gestalt estimate for assessing bleeding risk. A VTE-specific bleeding score has been generated (VTE-Bleed) using data derived from randomized trials that studied the direct oral thrombin inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, as an anticoagulant for VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; however, VTE-bleed requires external validation before it can be recommended for routine use. Details regarding the use of scoring systems that estimate the risk of bleeding are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism#H380273132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rationale and indications for indefinite anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism&quot;, section on 'Assessing the risk of bleeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr#H624013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;, section on 'Bleeding risk'</a>.)</p><p>Most clinicians agree that patients with a three-month bleeding risk of less than 2 percent (low risk) should be anticoagulated. In addition, most clinicians agree that patients with a three-month bleeding risk of more than 13 percent (high risk) should not be anticoagulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For patients with an estimated bleeding risk between these values, there is no agreement regarding the preferred approach such that the decision to anticoagulate in this population must be individualized according to the values and preferences of the patient as well as the risk-benefit ratio, which may change over time.

Intravenous (IV) UFH is usually the anticoagulant of choice while a decision to pursue more aggressive therapy is being considered. Patients with extensive DVT but without signs of PCD do not routinely receive thrombolysis but should be anticoagulated and monitored closely for the development of PCD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1027910771\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCD is part of a clinical spectrum that ranges from phlegmasia alba dolens to venous gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. PCD results from acute massive venous thrombosis that causes an obstruction of the venous drainage of an extremity (upper or lower) and is associated with a high degree of morbidity. Patients usually present with sudden severe pain, swelling, cyanosis, edema, venous gangrene, and compartment syndrome that together impair arterial supply, such that circulatory collapse and shock frequently ensue. Delay in treatment may result in death or loss of the patient's limb.</p><p>PCD occurs at any age but is more common during the fifth and sixth decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/63,64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64,67</a>]. The incidence is higher in females than in males. Malignancy is the most common triggering factor and is present in approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients. Other associated risk factors include the typical risk factors for thrombosis (eg, inherited thrombophilias, surgery, trauma, vena caval filter insertion, pregnancy). Approximately 10 percent of patients have idiopathic PCD.</p><p>In the lower extremities, left-sided involvement is three to four times more common than right-sided involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Upper extremity PCD is unusual and occurs in less than 5 percent of patients. </p><p>Manifestations may be gradual or fulminant. Most cases are preceded by phlegmasia alba dolens, with symptoms of edema, pain, and blanching (alba) without cyanosis. As it progresses, massive fluid sequestration may lead to bleb and bullae formation and eventually cyanosis (cerulea) and venous gangrene ensue. The pain is constant, severe, and usually starts at the femoral triangle and progresses to the entire extremity. Cyanosis is the pathognomonic finding of PCD, progressing from distal to proximal areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3159868231\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCD is the only accepted indication for thrombolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombectomy in patients with DVT, especially in those with signs of ischemia or gangrene. Accordingly, catheter-directed thrombolysis or rapid removal of the occluding thrombus using manual techniques (eg, surgical or catheter-directed thrombectomy) should be seriously considered in this population of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/68-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-74</a>]. Thus, it is prudent to obtain an interventional radiology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular surgery consultation for patients with PCD, especially those with impending gangrene. The selected intervention(s) will depend upon available expertise. Detailed discussion of thrombolytic therapy and thrombectomy for this population are discussed separately.

Our preference for IV UFH as the initial anticoagulant is based upon clinical experience and lack of data to support low molecular weight heparin or direct oral anticoagulants in this population, as well as the potential need to acutely discontinue anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">when/if</span> the decision is made to proceed with thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Once the threat of ischemia is resolved, most experts similar to the general population treat with anticoagulants for minimum of three months, similar to the general population; however, the selection of agent for long term therapy and total duration of therapy should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The risk of PE during more aggressive forms of exercise, physical therapy, or rehabilitation is unknown. However, in this setting we typically gradually increase exercise training as tolerated by the patient. Symptoms such as pain or leg edema may limit ambulation. Compression stockings may be useful for symptomatic relief and the promotion of ambulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256309248\"><span class=\"h2\">Compression stockings for the prevention of PTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, we prefer to avoid the routine use of elastic graduated compression stockings (GCS) that provide 30 to 40 mmHg of ankle pressure for the prevention of PTS. This preference is based upon randomized studies that have not shown clear consistent benefit. However, if the decision is made to use compression stockings, they should be started after anticoagulant therapy, within two weeks of the diagnosis, and continued for two years. </p><p>Evidence evaluating elastic GCS for the prevention of PTS is conflicting with smaller trials suggesting benefit and one large randomized trial reporting no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9,58,84-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,58,84-94</a>]. Most trials were hampered by methodologic flaws including imprecise estimation of recurrence and differing criteria for the assessment of PTS (Ginsberg or Villalta criteria). In addition, many trials were not blinded and had variable initial randomization periods (zero to two weeks) and control groups (no stockings, stockings with 5 mmHg pressure at the ankles, GCS one to two sizes too big). Thus, while meta-analyses report marginal benefit with elastic GCS, this benefit is questionable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small randomized trials of patients with acute DVT (first or recurrent) that used the Villalta criteria for PTS, suggested that GCS that apply an ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg started within two weeks and continued for two years to reduce the occurrence of PTS by 50 percent without increasing the frequency of recurrent VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. Patients most likely to benefit included those with a proximal DVT, prior DVT, and those with symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 806 patients with first proximal DVT reported no difference in the rate of PTS with GCS as measured by the less stringent Ginsberg criteria (leg pain and swelling one month or more; 14 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. A similar lack of benefit was reported when the more rigorous Villalta criteria were applied. Based upon this study, we and other experts do not routinely apply GCS for the prevention of PTS<strong>.</strong></p><p/><p>Although GCS are not harmful, many patients also decline their use because they are uncomfortable, costly, inconvenient, and often require a healthcare giver for their application. However, a subset of patients with recurrent DVT or moderate to severe symptoms may consider the potential benefits of GCS to outweigh these inconveniences. In such patients, the purpose of GCS is often focused on symptom reduction rather than prevention of PTS. </p><p>When the decision is made to wear GCS, they should be started <strong>after</strong> anticoagulant therapy. This is to avoid the theoretical risk of promoting embolism to the lung from fresh clot in the lower extremity. GCS should be continued for two years, replaced every six months, and may require refitting once local swelling is reduced. Alternative approaches of compressive bandages, application of GCS for limited periods (eg, for the duration of anticoagulation) or following thrombolytic therapy have not been adequately evaluated.</p><p>Contraindications to GCS include skin ulceration, severe arterial insufficiency, allergy to the stocking material, and inability to apply stockings. </p><p>The use of compression stockings as a <strong>therapy</strong> for PTS is discussed separately.

Thrombolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombectomy are usually reserved for patients with phlegmasia cerulea dolens or massive iliofemoral DVT or for patients who fail therapeutic anticoagulation. Additionally, suitable candidates for thrombolysis should have symptoms for &lt;14 days (ie, fresh clot; organized clot will not undergo lysis), good functional status, and low bleeding risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Thrombolytic therapy is not routinely administered for most patients with DVT. When compared with parenteral anticoagulation, although thrombolysis is associated with more rapid and complete lysis, reduced rates of PTS, and higher rates of preserved venous valve function, rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism and mortality are unchanged. In addition, the risk of major bleeding associated with systemic thrombolysis is considered by most experts to be unacceptably high when weighed against the benefits of decreased PTS. </p><p>Thrombolytic agents can be administered systemically or via a catheter inserted into the affected lower extremity vein (catheter-directed thrombolysis). It is generally considered that compared with systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis can achieve clot lysis more rapidly and with lower doses, thereby reducing the risk of bleeding. One theoretical advantage of thrombolysis is a more complete removal of clot from smaller venules that cannot be removed surgically, a feature that may be important for patients with PCD who have severe venous gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

Typically, IVC filters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51423 \">table 6</a>) are used in patients with acute proximal DVT and PE who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulant therapy (eg, recent surgery, hemorrhagic stroke, active bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Although not considered absolute indications, placement of an IVC filter is also often considered as an adjunctive therapy in patients with recurrent embolism despite adequate anticoagulation, as well as in patients in whom an additional embolic event would be poorly tolerated (eg, those with poor cardiopulmonary reserve from massive PE or underlying cardiopulmonary disease, hemodynamically unstable patients), although this approach is unproven. The efficacy of IVC filter placement in patients with symptomatic isolated distal DVT is unknown and not generally performed. Filters are typically placed in the infrarenal portion of the IVC; as such, their major purpose is the prevention of embolization of lower extremity clot to the lung. In general, we prefer retrievable filters but the compliance with retrieval tends to be low.

An eight-year follow-up of the same population of patients confirmed these findings that filter placement was associated with a successful reduction in the rate of PE (15 versus 6 percent) but an increase in the rate of DVT (35 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Initial anticoagulation refers to anticoagulant therapy that is administered immediately and for up to 10 days following a diagnosis of DVT to provide protection from recurrent thrombosis in this period of highest risk. Long-term (finite) anticoagulation is administered for a minimum of three months and extended for 6 to 12 months in some cases. A small population of patients will require indefinite anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H1138350780\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT, we recommend anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), provided the risk of bleeding is not high. In patients with asymptomatic proximal DVT, we suggest anticoagulation identical to that for patients with symptomatic DVT. For most patients with symptomatic isolated distal DVT, we suggest anticoagulation rather than serial compression ultrasonography (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For select patients with isolated distal DVT (eg, those at high risk of bleeding, negative D-dimer level, asymptomatic or minor symptoms, without risk factors for extension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> minor thrombosis of the muscular veins), we suggest surveillance with serial ultrasound over a two-week period rather than anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Those who exhibit signs of thrombus extension should be anticoagulated. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, anticoagulation should be started immediately (<strong>initial </strong>anticoagulation) as a delay in therapy increases the risk of potentially life-threatening embolization. Options include subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, the oral factor Xa inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH). A decision between these agents is usually made based upon clinician experience as well as the risks of bleeding, patient comorbidities, preferences, cost, and convenience. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thromboembolism-initiation-of-anticoagulation-first-10-days\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thromboembolism: Initiation of anticoagulation (first 10 days)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H119624123\" class=\"local\">'Initial anticoagulation (first 10 days)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient anticoagulation rather than inpatient therapy can be considered when patients are hemodynamically stable, have a low risk of bleeding, do not have renal insufficiency, and have a practical system in place at home for the administration and surveillance of anticoagulant therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70140\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70140 \">table 5</a>). It is not appropriate in patients with massive DVT (eg, iliofemoral DVT, phlegmasia cerulea dolens), concurrent pulmonary embolism, a high risk of bleeding on anticoagulant therapy, comorbid conditions, or other factors that warrant in-hospital care. (See <a href=\"#H726449277\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic anticoagulation should be ensured during the transition from initial to <strong>long-term</strong> (maintenance) therapy. Options for long-term agents are oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa inhibitors, [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>], thrombin inhibitors [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>], and vitamin K antagonists [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>]), as well as subcutaneous agents (LMW heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>). While the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors are preferred, a decision between these agents is usually made based upon clinician experience as well as the risks of bleeding, patient comorbidities, preferences, cost, and convenience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107541 \">table 4</a>). Interruptions should be minimized during the first three months of anticoagulation due to the high risk of recurrent thrombosis.

Although there is agreement on the <strong>minimum</strong> length of time a patient with a first episode of DVT should be treated (ie, three months), the <strong>optimal</strong> length of time is not known. For most patients with a first episode of DVT (provoked and unprovoked, proximal and distal), anticoagulants should be administered for <strong>three months</strong> rather than for shorter periods (eg, four or six weeks). Most experts also agree that extending anticoagulation beyond three months is considered in select populations.

We also suggest that an IVC filter be placed for patients with acute proximal DVT who have recurrent embolism despite adequate anticoagulation and for patients who have poor cardiopulmonary reserve who may not tolerate additional embolism. We prefer retrievable filters for the avoidance of long term complications of filter placement. Additionally, we prefer that patients with DVT receive a conventional course of anticoagulation once the contraindication resolves.

In patients with active malignancy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and direct oral anticoagulants are alternatives when LMW heparin cannot be administered.
