OSP was formerly sold without prescription under the brand name &quot;Fleet Phospho-soda&quot; (C.B. Fleet Inc). Fleet no longer distributes OSP; however, generic versions of OSP are still available without prescription. OSP is also available by prescription in a pill form (Visicol, OsmoPrep). In both pill and liquid form, OSP is a hyperosmotic laxative that acts by drawing water into the gastrointestinal tract. Although long used as a laxative, OSP began to be used as a purgative for colonoscopy in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is frequently given in favor of standard polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based lavage solutions because of the smaller required volume, which results in better patient compliance and improved colonic cleansing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>However, there have been multiple cases of OSP-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) with defining histologic features on biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. This clinicopathologic entity has been referred to as acute phosphate nephropathy.</p><p>In 2006, in response to published reports, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for AKI in patients who received OSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The warning was incorporated into a consensus document on bowel preparation by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In December 2008, the FDA required that a boxed warning be added to labeling of Visicol and OsmoPrep, which are still available by prescription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At the same time, following the recommendation of the FDA, over-the-counter preparations that contain OSP were voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Fleet; but, as noted above, generic versions are still available. In 2014, the FDA issued another warning that using more than one dose in 24 hours of OSP to treat constipation can cause &quot;rare but serious harm to the kidneys and heart, and even death&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>This topic provides a review of the clinical features of acute phosphate nephropathy. AKI associated with an increased phosphate load has also been described in tumor lysis syndrome, especially with alkalinization of the urine by bicarbonate-containing intravenous (IV) fluids. Tumor lysis syndrome is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Definition, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, etiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism underlying acute phosphate nephropathy most likely relates to a transient but potentially severe increase in serum phosphate coupled with volume depletion, both of which may occur following the administration of bowel purgatives that contain oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> (OSP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperphosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperphosphatemia occurs in a large number of patients following OSP ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>]. In one study, 28 percent of patients who underwent elective colonoscopy had serum phosphate concentrations &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L;</span> normal range 2.5 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.8 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> following OSP administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The high rate of hyperphosphatemia following the use of OSP as a bowel purgative reflects the ingestion of a large amount of phosphate over a short period of time; this leads to a marked increase in phosphate absorption since the intestinal sodium-phosphate cotransporters that mediate absorption cannot be rapidly downregulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Until reports were published describing acute phosphate nephropathy, the recommended dose as a bowel preparation provided 11.6 grams of phosphorus within 24 hours, an amount that far exceeds the usual dietary intake of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. Subsequent to reports of kidney injury, a phosphate dose reduction of 17 to 20 percent has been instituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Hyperphosphatemia is more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency, who have decreased excretion of phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/17,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-23</a>]. As a result, OSP is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant acute or chronic impairment in renal function.</p><p>However, hyperphosphatemia also occurs in patients with normal renal function, as illustrated in a study of 70 patients with creatinine clearances &gt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. After OSP administration, 37 percent had serum phosphate levels &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. In this study, there was a strong correlation between patient age and the degree of hyperphosphatemia, suggesting that age-related factors (including decreased total body water, abnormal bowel motility, enhanced gastrointestinal absorption) unrelated to kidney function promote hyperphosphatemia. As a result, advanced age may increase the risk for the development of acute phosphate nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Hyperphosphatemia is more likely to occur in patients who have impaired gastrointestinal motility, which leads to increased phosphate absorption. Gastrointestinal obstruction is a contraindication to the use of OSP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrocalcinosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which hyperphosphatemia causes kidney injury is not known, although hypotheses have been raised based on observed histology. The predominant (though not exclusive) finding on renal biopsy is widespread deposition of calcium phosphate in tubular lumina, tubular epithelia, and the interstitium. There is also evidence of tubular epithelial injury and inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>One hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis is that transient hyperphosphatemia leads to an increased intratubular phosphate concentration, resulting in the precipitation and tissue deposition of calcium phosphate salts that cause luminal obstruction, direct tubular epithelial injury, and activation of the immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>].</p><p>Although tubular injury is noted in all nephron segments, calcium phosphate deposition is limited to the distal tubule and collecting duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The delivery of phosphate to these sites is enhanced by the decrease in proximal tubular phosphate absorption that occurs within minutes of OSP ingestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intraluminal calcium phosphate deposition is probably worsened by volume depletion, which often results from the OSP-induced osmotic diarrhea in the setting of reduced oral intake prior to the procedure. Conditions that cause effective volume depletion, such as heart failure and ascites, are contraindications to the use of OSP.</p><p>True or effective volume depletion results in increased sodium chloride and water reabsorption in the proximal tubule. This effect, combined with ongoing water reabsorption in the descending limb of the loop of Henle, raises the calcium phosphate product within the tubular lumen in the fluid presented to the ascending limb and distal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Volume depletion may also increase the adherence of calcium phosphate crystals to the distal tubule epithelium via an increase in surface expression of hyaluronan and osteopontin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) appear to be at increased risk for acute phosphate nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/8,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>ACE inhibitors and ARBs worsen the prerenal state caused by OSP-induced volume depletion by promoting the loss of angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction, which reduces glomerular filtration. In addition, ACE inhibitors and ARBs decrease angiotensin II-dependent proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption, which leads to an increase in distal tubular bicarbonate concentration. The increase in intraluminal pH promotes precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chief pathologic characteristic of acute phosphate nephropathy is extensive deposition of calcium phosphate in the tubular lumina, within tubular epithelial cells, and, less commonly, in the peritubular interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Calcium phosphate deposits are distinguished from calcium oxalate deposits by positive staining with the &quot;von Kossa stain&quot; and the absence of birefringence under polarized light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55578 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Other findings observed on renal biopsy depend upon the elapsed time between oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> (OSP) exposure and the time at which the biopsy was performed. Early biopsies show tubular degenerative changes similar to those seen in acute tubular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These changes include luminal ectasia, cytoplasmic simplification, loss of brush border, shedding of cell fragments into the lumina, and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tubular degenerative changes and calcifications are accompanied by interstitial edema and mild to moderate interstitial inflammation that is not typically associated with significant tubulitis.</p><p>In contrast, renal biopsies performed more than three weeks following OSP use show chronic changes, including tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The tubular degenerative changes are less severe and more localized and resemble changes seen in repeat renal biopsies from patients with nonresolving acute tubular necrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no reliable data on the incidence of acute phosphate nephropathy in patients with previously intact renal function. A number of retrospective studies have examined this issue by evaluating the frequency or magnitude of reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 6 to 12 months after the administration of bowel purgatives that contain oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> (OSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/28,29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,32,33</a>].</p><p>However, all of these studies are limited in a variety of ways, including lack of confirmation of the diagnosis by renal biopsy. This is an important issue since many patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) following OSP administration do not have acute phosphate nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Acute and reversible kidney injury'</a> below.)</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest study is an observational analysis of 9799 Department of Defense beneficiaries who underwent colonoscopy between 2002 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. AKI, defined as a &gt;50 percent increase in serum creatinine from baseline within one year following colonoscopy, was observed in 114 patients. After adjusting for putative risk factors, OSP was the strongest risk factor for AKI (risk ratio [RR] 2.35, 95% CI 1.51-3.66).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective case-control study evaluated 2237 patients who had outpatient colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. AKI, defined as a 25 percent or a 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (44.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> increase in serum creatinine over six months postcolonoscopy, was identified in 141 patients (6.3 percent). An association between OSP and AKI was only seen in patients who received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, interpretation of this study is limited by the small sample size and the permissive definition of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. When a stricter definition of AKI (which required an increase in creatinine of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [88.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> was employed, the number of cases of kidney injury fell from 116 to 3.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following potential risk factors for the development of acute phosphate nephropathy have been identified. However, since only the series from Columbia University had biopsy confirmation of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], one cannot be certain how many of the patients with impaired renal function in other series had acute phosphate nephropathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phosphate dosing &ndash; The degree of hyperphosphatemia is directly related to the total amount of administered OSP, and a greater degree of hyperphosphatemia is likely to increase the risk of acute phosphate nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/3,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35-37</a>]. A wider interval between the administration of the two doses of OSP (ie, 24 versus 12 hours) is associated with a lesser degree of hyperphosphatemia and, therefore, is likely to be safer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/20,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) &ndash; Reduced GFR increases the risk of hyperphosphatemia following OSP administration.

In this report, 11 older patients with a mean age of 80 years (range 61 to 89 years) developed AKI following the administration of Fleet enemas; of these, three individuals had received large doses of 500 to 798 mL, and eight had received standard doses of 250 to 266 mL. Four patients had normal baseline renal function (defined as eGFR &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>), and seven had reduced renal function (eGFR between 25 to 57 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Although renal functional outcomes are not provided, five patients expired. Histologic confirmation of the diagnosis of acute phosphate nephropathy was available for a single patient in whom tubular calcium phosphate deposits were found at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

AKI occurs in the setting of severe hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, leading to tetany, cardiac arrest, and, in some cases, death. Patients who survive the immediate event typically return to normal or near-normal renal function. As a result, renal biopsy was not performed.</p><p>It appears likely that the AKI in these patients was due to prerenal factors or acute tubular necrosis rather than acute phosphate nephropathy.

In the Department of Defense study cited above, 16 percent of patients returned to their baseline serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phosphate-nephropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, renal biopsies were not performed, and some or many of these patients may have had acute tubular necrosis rather than acute phosphate nephropathy.</p><p>Given the poor prognosis, identification of patients at risk and preventive measures are important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute phosphate nephropathy is suggested by the temporal association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the administration of bowel purgatives that contain oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> (OSP). However, some patients present late after the exposure with chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p><p>The diagnosis of phosphate nephropathy is supported by a benign sediment on urinalysis and modest proteinuria. By definition, all patients with phosphate nephropathy should be normocalcemic since hypercalcemia may also cause nephrocalcinosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrocalcinosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrocalcinosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no reports of the use of imaging to demonstrate nephrocalcinosis in acute phosphate nephropathy. As a result, the diagnosis can be confirmed only by renal biopsy, which may not be required in patients with AKI diagnosed shortly after using an OSP purgative. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the patient who presents days to months following colonoscopy with an elevated creatinine, minimal proteinuria, and a relatively bland urine sediment, the differential diagnosis includes acute and chronic tubular and interstitial diseases. These include acute and chronic forms of interstitial nephritis, ischemic and toxic forms of acute tubular necrosis, and myeloma cast nephropathy, to name a few. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once a renal biopsy is obtained, all causes of nephrocalcinosis should be considered, including conditions associated with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia, or hyperphosphatemia with hyperphosphaturia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nephrocalcinosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single, most important preventive strategy is to identify patients who are at higher risk for the development of acute phosphate nephropathy and then avoid the administration of bowel purgatives that contain oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> (OSP), if possible. Specific recommendations for the choice of bowel preparation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no specific treatment for established acute phosphate nephropathy. However, acute hemodialysis is likely to be beneficial in the infrequent patient who is diagnosed within 12 to 24 hours after OSP administration and still has marked hyperphosphatemia. As noted above, most patients are diagnosed later, and, since complete recovery of renal function is rare, these patients should be treated the same as others with chronic kidney disease (CKD). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Acute phosphate nephropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3689777658\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Acute phosphate nephropathy has also been reported following the administration of sodium phosphate-containing enemas. Acute phosphate nephropathy is usually detected days to months following OSP administration. This entity is complicated by the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of acute phosphate nephropathy is related to volume depletion and transient OSP-induced hyperphosphatemia and involves precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals in the distal tubule. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal biopsy reveals an acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy with the distinctive finding of abundant tubular and interstitial deposits of calcium phosphate. In biopsies performed within three weeks of OSP exposure, findings of acute tubular injury predominate and resemble changes seen in acute tubular necrosis. Later biopsies exhibit findings of chronicity, including tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of acute phosphate nephropathy remains unknown. Acute phosphate nephropathy can occur in patients with normal renal function. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apparent risk factors for acute phosphate nephropathy include advanced age, hypertension, renal dysfunction, volume depletion, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Possible additional risk factors include the use of diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, the presence of diabetes, and female gender. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful review of all contraindications to the use of OSP should be done prior to selection of a bowel purgative for an individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific recommendations for the choice of bowel preparation are discussed elsewhere.
