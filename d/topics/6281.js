During the past decade, the proportion of SAB cases due to MRSA appears to be declining, possibly due to improved infection control practices. (See <a href=\"#H17372030\" class=\"local\">'Hospital onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular catheters are also playing an increasing role in healthcare-associated, community-onset SAB. SAB acquired in long-term care facilities typically affects older adults and chronically ill patients. Skin or soft tissue lesions such as decubitus ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, or wounds are common causes of SAB in individuals who reside in these facilities. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Community onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of community-acquired SAB, particularly in the absence of an identifiable focus of infection, is an important marker for complicated staphylococcal infection. (See <a href=\"#H17372108\" class=\"local\">'Community acquired'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare contact (eg, prior hospitalization) is an important risk factor for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> infection, but there are numerous reports of patients with no identifiable healthcare contacts or other risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H873969721\" class=\"local\">'Methicillin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An implanted foreign body that becomes infected is a potential source for SAB. Implanted devices include vascular catheters, surgically implanted materials, and orthopedic prostheses. (See <a href=\"#H17373454\" class=\"local\">'Prosthetic device'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection drug users (IDUs) who develop SAB are usually young and otherwise healthy. The combination of high skin colonization rate with <em>S. aureus</em> and repeated parenteral injection of nonsterile material makes IDUs prone to SAB. (See <a href=\"#H17373500\" class=\"local\">'Injection drug use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inherited defects in white blood cell function or immune function predispose patients to recurrent staphylococcal infections. Patients with nasal colonization are more prone to <em>S. aureus</em> infection, including SAB. (See <a href=\"#H17373527\" class=\"local\">'Host factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3586554391\" class=\"local\">'Nasal colonization'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">El Atrouni WI, Knoll BM, Lahr BD, et al.
