It does this by measuring the electrical activity in the heart. A normal heartbeat happens when an electrical signal starts in a spot near the top of the heart. This signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes (&quot;beats&quot;), it pumps blood through the whole body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98933470\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a stress test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A stress test measures how well the heart works when it is beating fast and working hard. When the heart pumps fast, it needs more blood. A stress test helps doctors see if the heart is getting enough blood during these times. A stress test is sometimes called an &quot;exercise test&quot; or a &quot;treadmill test.&quot;</p><p>A person can have an ECG without having a stress test. But if a person has a stress test, he or she will always have an ECG with it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98933477\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order an ECG or a stress test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order an ECG to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See if you are having or had a heart attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look for other heart conditions or follow a known heart condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help figure out why you have chest pain, trouble breathing, dizziness, a fast heart rate, or other symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how healthy your heart is before you have surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well your heart medicines or other heart treatments are working</p><p/><p>Doctors usually order stress tests to check for problems that can happen when the heart works hard. Your doctor might order a stress test to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See if you have coronary heart disease, heart failure, or another heart condition &ndash; Coronary heart disease is a condition that puts you at risk for a heart attack and other types of heart disease. Some people have symptoms of coronary heart disease only when they exercise. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart doesn't pump well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well your heart works after heart surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help figure out why you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or other symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See if you can safely exercise after a heart attack</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98933484\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for an ECG or a stress test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before an ECG, you don't need do anything special. But you should tell your doctor what medicines you take, because they might affect the test results.</p><p>To prepare for a stress test, you will probably need to avoid eating, drinking, or smoking for 3 hours beforehand. If you are on any heart medicines, you might also need to change or stop some of them before the test. Your doctor or nurse should tell you if you need to change or stop any of your medicines.</p><p>For your stress test, you should wear comfortable clothes that you can exercise in. You should also bring any inhalers that you use to help your breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98933491\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during an ECG and stress test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For an ECG, a doctor, nurse, or technician will first stick patches (called &quot;electrodes&quot;) onto your chest, arms, and legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>). Wires connect the patches to the ECG machine. The machine will measure and record your heart's electrical activity and print out the results. Having an ECG doesn't hurt.</p><p>For a stress test, the doctor, nurse, or technician will first do an ECG and measure your blood pressure. Then he or she will &quot;stress&quot; your heart and increase your heart rate by doing one of the following things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you run or walk on a treadmill (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60855 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you pedal a stationary bike (a bike that doesn't move, except for the pedals)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicine to make your heart beat faster &ndash; People who can't run or walk can get medicine instead of exercising.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, doctors do imaging tests during a stress test. These kinds of tests can create images of the blood flow to the heart.</p><p>During your stress test, the doctor or nurse will watch you. He or she will check your blood pressure, do several ECGs, and ask how you feel. You might also need to breathe into a tube at certain times during the test. The test will end when you can't exercise anymore or when your doctor or nurse tells you the test is over.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98933498\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of an ECG and stress test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ECG has very few downsides. Some people get a mild rash where the patches were placed.</p><p>A stress test can have some downsides. When people exercise and their heart pumps fast, they can have symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or faint</p><p/><p>The medicines used during a stress test can also cause side effects, including headaches, dizziness, or nausea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98933594\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nuclear-heart-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nuclear heart testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-qt-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Long QT syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chest pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
