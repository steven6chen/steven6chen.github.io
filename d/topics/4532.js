The clinician evaluating the patient should consider diseases that explain the patient&rsquo;s symptoms better than conversion disorder, as well as diseases that are comorbid (eg, in about 10 percent of cases, patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures also have epilepsy, or patients with multiple sclerosis may also have functional weakness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is also therapeutic as patients may feel understood and unburdened. We routinely ask about fatigue, pain, dizziness, sleep disturbance, and impaired memory and concentration if the patient does not volunteer these. After the list is complete, return to each symptom as necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Multiple current conversion symptoms (mixed symptoms subtype of conversion disorder, eg motor and sensory symptoms) are often found in conversion disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. In a prospective study of 54 patients with conversion disorder, mixed symptoms occurred in 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and a randomized trial of 127 patients with conversion disorder found that the mean number of functional symptoms was 2.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with conversion disorder often report a large number of current or prior unexplained physical symptoms, dissociative symptoms, or unexplained syndromes (eg, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or chronic fatigue syndrome [also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease]), in addition to conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. As an example, one prospective study found that the mean number of physical symptoms was greater in patients with functional weakness (n = 107) than patients with weakness due to recognizable neurologic disease (n = 46) (9 versus 5 symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Circumstances at onset &ndash; </strong>Clinical features that are commonly observed at onset of conversion symptoms include panic attacks, migraine headache, or pain, as well as physical injury. A systematic review of 132 observational studies of conversion disorder (869 patients) found that physical injury occurred immediately prior to onset in 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although subsequent studies are consistent with this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], it is not known whether recent physical injury is specific to conversion disorder. In addition, both functional (psychogenic) nonepileptic seizures and conversion motor symptoms may occur after general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, onset of conversion symptoms is often sudden. As an example, a prospective study of 107 patients with functional weakness found that sudden onset (&le;6 hours to maximal onset) while awake occurred in 46 percent, or upon waking from sleep or general anaesthesia in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissociation</strong> &ndash; Dissociation in the form of depersonalization (feeling disconnected from oneself) or derealization (feeling detached from the environment) may be present in patients with conversion disorder, particularly at onset of the disorder or in association with a nonepileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Patients who believe that they have multiple sclerosis need an explanation that differs from patients who believe that symptoms are related to stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients frequently believe that conversion symptoms are not due to psychologic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As an example, one prospective study (n = 153) found that the belief that stress was a possible cause of the illness occurred in fewer patients with functional weakness than patients with weakness due to recognizable neurologic disease (24 versus 56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Illness beliefs in patients with conversion disorder are often comparable to the beliefs of patients with recognizable neurologic disease, including the conviction that a disease with a known pathologic basis is present and that symptoms are causing major consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. This is understandable in a situation where the alternative (no disease) is considered by the general public to be equivalent to &ldquo;faking it.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychosocial functioning</strong> &ndash; The relationship between conversion symptoms and psychosocial functioning is bidirectional (each can affect the other) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history</strong> &ndash; Illnesses in parents, siblings, and children are common in patients with conversion disorder. As an example, one prospective study (n = 60) found that general medical disorders in first degree relatives were more common among patients with conversion disorder than patients with recognizable neurologic disease (80 versus 37 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Psychiatric disorders were also more common in relatives of conversion disorder patients. In addition, some studies have found that patients with conversion disorder have a family history of conversion disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, it is not established that patients with conversion disorder mimic the symptoms of other individuals. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Course of illness</strong> &ndash; Asking &ldquo;When did you last feel well&rdquo; is a useful way of determining when onset of conversion symptoms occurred, particularly for patients who have been ill for several years. In addition, a large amount of information can be condensed by drawing a graph with time on the x axis, severity of symptoms on the y axis, and adding life events or treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88078 \">figure 1</a>). The intensity of conversion symptoms may fluctuate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Previous conversion symptoms </strong>&ndash; The presenting symptom is more likely to represent conversion disorder if there is a past history of conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prior hospitalization</strong> &ndash; Previous hospitalization may be associated with conversion symptoms. As an example, one prospective study (n = 60) found a history of hospitalization in more patients with conversion disorder than patients with recognizable neurologic disease (70 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prior clinicians</strong> &ndash; Patients may complain about prior clinicians, and provide clues as to which explanations of the disorder and treatments are likely to be rejected. In addition, this part of the assessment demonstrates that one is interested in the patient&rsquo;s suffering and frustration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recent psychological stressors</strong> &ndash; Although adverse life events are common in patients with conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>], many patients do not have obvious life events and stressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, psychological factors at onset are not necessarily specific to conversion disorder and can thus be diagnostically misleading. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis#H13156103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Premorbid clinical factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbid psychiatric symptoms and disorders</strong> &ndash; We typically leave questions about depression and anxiety until the end of the assessment (unless the patient volunteers it). Many patients with conversion disorder become understandably defensive regarding questions of anxiety and depression if they think that their symptoms will be blamed on a &ldquo;mental disorder.&rdquo; For many patients, attributing physical symptoms to a mental disorder is the same as suggesting that the symptoms are &ldquo;fake.&rdquo; It may thus be helpful to avoid using terms such as depression or anxiety and frame the questions in terms of the presenting symptoms. As an example, we may ask &ldquo;Does your weakness ever make you feel down or frustrated?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Have you been feeling depressed?&rdquo; Anxiety and dysphoria are often but not always present in patients with conversion disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13158936\" class=\"local\">'Psychiatric disorders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical and sexual abuse</strong> &ndash; Questions about abuse or adverse experiences, like those for comorbid psychiatric disorders, are often best left to the end of the assessment or a follow-up visit. Patients may be more forthcoming after trust has been established during the preceding phases of the assessment. It is important to provide patients enough time to discuss the issue if they volunteer information about abuse; clinicians pressed for time will be better served by asking about abuse during a subsequent interview or leaving this to a different clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A prior history of aversive childhood experiences (abuse or neglect) is more common in patients with conversion disorder than healthy and disease controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, it is not clear that a history of sexual abuse is more common in conversion disorder than patients with other psychiatric disorders, and most patients with conversion disorder have not experienced abuse or neglect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prognosis#H13156103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Premorbid clinical factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other clinical features previously identified as specific to conversion disorder include <em>la belle indifference</em> and a predominance of left sided symptoms; however, the evidence indicates that these two features are not specific to patients with conversion disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/20,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,32</a>].</p><p><em>La belle indifference</em>, which refers to an incongruous lack of concern (indifference) about significant symptoms, has no validity in discriminating conversion disorder from recognizable neurologic disease. In a systematic review of 11 prospective or retrospective studies, the median frequency of <em>la belle indifference</em> was comparable for patients with conversion disorder (n = 356) and patients with defined neurologic disease (n = 157) (21 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In our experience, <em>la belle indifference</em> often indicates that patients are trying to appear brave or cheerful in the presence of actual distress (to avoid receiving a psychiatric diagnosis such as depression), or may less often suggest factitious disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Unilateral conversion symptoms do not appear to be more common on one side of the body than the other. Although a meta-analysis of 90 observational studies (1139 patients with conversion symptoms) found that left sided symptoms occurred in more patients than right sided symptoms (58 versus 42 percent), this finding appeared to be due to reporting bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A separate analysis was conducted in the 78 studies (553 patients) in which laterality was reported incidentally in the study text and did not appear in the title; a left sided preponderance of symptoms was found in only 53 percent of patients. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13158852\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who present with symptoms that may represent conversion disorder, the principles of assessment are to look for evidence of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inconsistency at different points in the examination (eg, a patient with no ankle plantar flexion while supine on the examination table is able to stand on tip toes). In addition, observing patients before and after the formal examination can be revealing.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis#H2516698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Neurologic and general medical disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13157954\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion disorder can present with different symptoms, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonepileptic seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weakness and paralysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal movement </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Speech disturbances</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Globus sensation (swallowing symptoms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sensory symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Visual symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cognitive symptoms</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"#H13158831\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13158866\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes of conversion disorder'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of patients presenting with possible conversion disorder includes a medical history, physical examination, and indicated laboratory tests, as well as the psychiatric history and mental status examination. It is essential to look for neurologic and other general medical conditions, particularly early stage disease. (See <a href=\"#H13158831\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians taking the initial history of patients with a possible diagnosis of conversion disorder should ask about all current somatic symptoms, circumstances at onset, dissociation, disability, illness beliefs, psychosocial functioning, family history, course of illness, previous conversion symptoms, prior hospitalization, prior clinicians, recent psychological stressors, and comorbid psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Questions about physical and sexual abuse are often best deferred until trust has been established during the preceding phases of the assessment. (See <a href=\"#H13158838\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with symptoms that may represent conversion disorder, clinicians should look for evidence of inconsistency at different points in the examination as well as incongruity between symptoms and recognized disease.
