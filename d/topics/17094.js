Ultrasound is used to assess four discrete biophysical parameters: fetal movement, fetal tone, fetal breathing, and amniotic fluid volume. A separate nonstress test of the fetal heart rate can also be performed. Each of the four ultrasound parameters and the nonstress test are given a score of 0 or 2 points (no 1 point), depending upon whether specific criteria are met (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79813 \">table 1</a>). A total score &ge;8 implies absence of significant central nervous system <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoxemia/acidemia</span> at the time of testing. A score &le;4 can be a sign of fetal compromise. Ideally, identification of a compromised fetus will make it possible for the provider to perform interventions that prevent adverse fetal sequelae.</p><p>This topic will review issues related to the BPP.

Specific conditions and clinical settings that may be indications for antenatal fetal assessment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antepartum fetal surveillance&quot;, section on 'Indications for fetal surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>Although the BPP is typically used for antepartum fetal assessment, it can also be performed intrapartum; however, its clinical utility in the intrapartum setting is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC BASIS OF BIOPHYSICAL MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3734795028\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All biophysical activities are regulated and controlled by discrete centers in the brain that are sensitive to both local factors and feedback from peripheral sensors. The presence of normal biophysical activity is presumptive evidence that these regulatory centers are intact, while the loss of normal biophysical activity can be a sign of pathologic neuronal suppression from hypoxemia, acidemia, and ischemia. However, the absence or diminution of a biophysical activity is not always pathologic. Normal suppression of a regulatory center can occur from intrinsic fetal rhythms, such as the deep stage of quiet sleep, or from transplacental passage of drugs that cause general suppression of the brain, such as sedatives and opiates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53974525\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of the BPP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biophysical parameters for the BPP discussed below are based upon their ease of measurement and the ability to evaluate them objectively using universally available equipment. Other fetal biophysical activities (eg, sucking, eye movements, swallowing, micturition) may serve equally well as markers of fetal health, but are not included because measurement is difficult and may be subjective.</p><p>The BPP and nonstress test assess five discrete biophysical parameters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79813 \">table 1</a>) that reflect central nervous system regulatory output and thus indirectly reflect the integrity of the regulatory center. Four of these parameters, fetal breathing movements, generalized fetal movements, fetal tone, and accelerations in the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movements (nonstress test), are acutely affected by fetal hypoxemia and acidemia. Amniotic fluid volume is a nonacute parameter since decreases in amniotic fluid volume occur gradually, in response to redistribution of fetal blood flow in response to chronic uteroplacental vascular insufficiency.</p><p>The acute parameters function to enhance fetal development, but are not essential to maintaining fetal life. When the fetus is stressed, these biophysical activities may stop or slow down to reduce fetal oxygen requirements. When fetal movement is prevented by administration of a short acting curare (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancuronium</a>), fetal venous PO<sub>2</sub> promptly rises by as much as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], illustrating the reduction in oxygen requirements in the resting state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351729060\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of absent fetal movement, tone, breathing, and/or heart rate acceleration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When one or more of these acute parameters is normal, the brain&rsquo;s regulatory center is likely to be intact, and pathologic conditions, such as hypoxemia or acidemia, can be reliably excluded. In contrast, when one or more of these acute parameters is abnormal, the possible causes need to be considered. </p><p>The most common benign cause of absence of one acute parameter is quiet fetal sleep. Since the sensitivity to depth and duration of quiet sleep varies by discrete regulatory center, it is unusual to observe the absence of two or more parameters as a consequence of quiet sleep alone. </p><p>The more parameters that are absent (ie, the lower the BPP score), the less likely the change is due to a sleep state. Similarly, the longer the absence of parameters, the more likely the cause is pathologic. Extending the observation period to encompass the usual duration of sleep state cycles (20 to 40 minutes) minimizes the possibility of confusing pathologic with physiologic causes of an absent parameter.</p><p>The degree of fall in oxygen concentration necessary to abolish a given central nervous system regulatory center output varies by center. The two most oxygen-sensitive centers are (1) the cardioregulatory neurons, which control the coupling of fetal movement and heart rate acceleration, and (2) the fetal breathing center neurons, which control fetal breathing movements. The centers regulating fetal movement have a higher threshold for hypoxemia than those for fetal breathing or fetal heart rate accelerations; the fetal tone center has the highest threshold. Thus, acute fetal biophysical activities respond to hypoxemia in a predictable, physiologically based cascade: loss of fetal breathing movements and fetal heart rate accelerations, followed by decreased fetal movement, and finally loss of fetal tone. This sequence is of clinical value since it allows for estimation of both the presence and severity of hypoxemia.</p><p>The threshold of the various regulatory centers is not absolute, and can adjust over time. This effect is likely a result of adaptive response, which increases local oxygen supply, rather than the result of a true change in neuronal oxygen requirements. Such compensatory responses include increased oxygen extraction, elevated fetal hemoglobin with increased oxygen carrying capacity, and redistribution of blood flow to favor brain perfusion. In some chronic fetal conditions, the acute biophysical parameters may initially disappear and then reappear despite a low PO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351729067\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of changes in amniotic volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal urine is the predominant source of amniotic fluid after about 16 weeks of gestation. Fetal urine production is primarily dependent upon renal perfusion, which in turn reflects selective distribution of cardiac output. The fetus responds to sustained hypoxemia by selective redistribution of its cardiac output, with preferential flow directed to the brain, heart, adrenals, and placenta at the expense of all other organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This protective mechanism is initiated by specialized chemoreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of amniotic fluid volume regulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypoxemia-induced reflex redistribution of cardiac output away from the kidneys results in diminished fetal urine production, ultimately leading to oligohydramnios and then anhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Theoretically, a decrease in fetal swallowing, which removes amniotic fluid, could compensate for the decrease in urine production, but fetal swallowing is a vegetative reflex that is very resistant to the effects of hypoxemia.</p><p>The time for development of oligohydramnios is usually relatively long. On average, it takes approximately 15 days for a fetus to progress from normal to reduced amniotic fluid volume (in the absence of membrane rupture) and 23 days to develop severe oligohydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, acute changes in amniotic fluid volume and rapid deterioration of the BPP score have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE BIOPHYSICAL PROFILE SCORE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2732876210\"><span class=\"h2\">Assigning points</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the composite BPP score is derived from five fetal parameters: four acute parameters (heart rate accelerations in response to movement [nonstress test], breathing movement, body and limb movement, tone) and one chronic parameter (amniotic fluid volume). Each of these five parameters has been evaluated independently and the normal characteristic defined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79813 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The scoring method used for each parameter is binary, ie, the parameter is either normal or abnormal; gradations of abnormality are not used. A normal parameter is assigned a score of two and an abnormal parameter is assigned a score of zero. The maximum score is <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10</span> and the minimum score is <span class=\"nowrap\">0/10</span>.</p><p>Monotonous picket-fence breathing or gasping should not be considered normal breathing movements and seizures should not be counted as normal fetal limb movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p>We base evaluation of amniotic fluid volume on ultrasound measurement of the largest pocket. To score two points, the largest pocket must have a vertical depth of &ge;2 centimeters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The horizontal dimension should be at least 1 cm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972105269\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of fetal observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average time to obtain a normal BPP score (BPP <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">8/8)</span> is 5.3 minutes, but can take up to 30 minutes. To confirm a BPP is equivocal <span class=\"nowrap\">(6/10)</span> or worse <span class=\"nowrap\">(&le;4/10)</span> will always require 30 minutes of observation. When all tests are considered (normal, equivocal, abnormal) the average testing time is about 18 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A parameter may be assigned a normal score as soon as it is observed. Because the acute parameters are subject to fetal sleep-wake cycles, the fetus should be observed continuously for at least 30 minutes before assigning an acute parameter 0 points. This time is based on ultrasound studies of fetuses from uncomplicated pregnancies. In one such study at 36 to 42 weeks of gestation, the mean duration of a fetal sleep (no somatic movements) was about 20 minutes, with an upper range of about 40 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fetal acoustic stimulation may be used to try to shorten testing time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437905353\"><span class=\"h2\">Can the nonstress test be omitted?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nonstress test does not enhance the performance of the BPP when the BPP is <span class=\"nowrap\">8/8</span>. The predictive value of the four ultrasound biophysical parameters (movement, tone, breathing, amniotic fluid volume) is equivalent to that of the four ultrasound parameters plus a nonstress test when the four ultrasound parameters are normal (2 points for each). In a prospective study in which the nonstress test was only performed if the ultrasound score was &lt;8, nonstress tests were performed in 2.7 percent of patients without reducing the predictive value of the test, which significantly reduced the average testing time per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A nonstress test should always be performed if any ultrasound monitored parameter is 0 (ie, BPP <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;6/8)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437905424\"><span class=\"h2\">Modified biophysical profile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modified BPP was developed to simplify the examination and reduce the time necessary to complete testing by focusing on those components of the BPP that are most predictive of outcome: nonstress test and amniotic fluid volume. Assessment of both the nonstress test and amniotic fluid volume appears to be as reliable a predictor of long-term fetal well-being as the full BPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The rate of stillbirth within one week of a normal modified BPP is the same as with the full BPP: 0.8 per 1000 women tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since about 90 percent of pregnancies that undergo a modified BPP will have a normal result, only a minority will need to proceed to a full biophysical evaluation, thus saving time and money [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H302709940\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2788764616\"><span class=\"h2\">BPP score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author interprets the BPP score as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">10/10,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">8/8</span> (nonstress test omitted), or <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> (-2 points for either fetal movement, tone, or breathing but not amniotic fluid)</strong> is a normal test result: The risk of fetal death within one week if the fetus is not delivered is low (0.4 to 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/1000</span> births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A BPP score of <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> by any combination of parameters is as reliable as a score of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10</span> for the prediction of fetal well-being, as long as no points are deducted for amniotic fluid volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A normal score is predictive of the absence of fetal compromise in the setting of high risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or fetal growth restriction. Before term, a normal score provides reassurance that the benefits of continued intrauterine maturation far outweigh the very small risk of fetal demise. Fetal death after a normal BPP is often due to an acute and unpredictable insult such as sudden cord prolapse, large fetomaternal hemorrhage, or abruptio placentae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a change in maternal condition affects this balance. The decision to intervene in a patient with worsening preeclampsia or unstable lie and prelabor rupture of membranes, for example, may depend less on the BPP score and more on maternal and fetal risk from continuing the pregnancy. Similarly, the presence of a favorable cervix may prompt delivery despite a normal BPP score when the fetus is at term.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">6/10</span> (-4 points for two of fetal movement, tone, breathing, but +2 points for amniotic fluid)</strong> is an equivocal test result, as a significant possibility of developing fetal asphyxia cannot be excluded.

As an example, a low BPP score in a high-risk patient requires the provider to consider the fetal and neonatal risks of expectant management versus delivery, and deliver when the balance shifts to greater fetal risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78999\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78999 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>0 to <span class=\"nowrap\">4/10</strong></span> is abnormal; the risk of fetal asphyxia within one week is 91 to <span class=\"nowrap\">600/1000</span> if there is no intervention.

The most consistent fetal heart rate change is a decrease in variability on days 2 and 3 after administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Fetal breathing and body movements are also commonly reduced, which may result in a lower BPP score or nonreactive nonstress test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. These findings should be considered within the total clinical picture when assessing a fetus for possible delivery because of a nonreassuring fetal evaluation (nonstress test or BPP) after corticosteroid administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The behavioral changes may reflect a physiologic response of the brain to glucocorticoids. Alternatively, they may be a consequence of a transient increase in fetal vascular resistance and blood pressure, which has been demonstrated in animal studies. Fetal blood flow velocity waveform patterns in the umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery, and ductus venosus do not appear to be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>].

Moreover, there are no randomized trials on which to base recommendations for the best initial testing approach for specific types of high-risk pregnancies, the optimal timing of test initiation, the frequency of testing based on test results, conditions that may affect test results, and the effect of gestational age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Meta-analysis of randomized trials</strong> -- In a 2008 meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing BPP with conventional fetal heart rate monitoring (five trials involving 2974 high risk pregnancies), use of the BPP did not reduce perinatal death (relative risk 1.33, 95%CI 0.60-2.98) or the frequency of low Apgar scores (RR 1.27, 95%CI 0.85-1.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

For example, in one observational study including almost 45,000 BPPs, the risk of fetal demise within one week of a normal test result was 0.8 per 1000 women tested (corrected for lethal congenital anomalies and unpredictable causes of demise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This result compares favorably with all other means of antepartum fetal assessment.

An inverse relationship between last BPP score and incidence of cerebral palsy has also been observed, and may or may not be related to antepartum asphyxia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54595\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54595 \">figure 4</a>). Long-term asphyxia leading to adverse neurologic outcomes such as cerebral palsy and intellectual disability appears to be significantly reduced in high-risk patients managed by fetal BPP scoring compared with untested low-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physiologic data</strong> -- The advent of ultrasound-guided intrauterine fetal blood sampling (cordocentesis) made it possible to measure the direct and immediate relationship between the BPP score, fetal PO<sub>2</sub>, and fetal pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. These studies, which include over 1000 paired observations, reported a direct relationship between the BPP score and mean umbilical venous pH and suggest that, in the individual fetus, the BPP score accurately predicts both the probability and severity of existing acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Thus, the score appears to be an accurate proxy for fetal acidosis. In contrast, the relationship between the BPP score and fetal PO<sub>2</sub> is less precise, which is expected since PO<sub>2</sub> varies according to fetal compensatory adaptive responses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING SCHEDULE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301661986\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing should begin as soon as an increased risk of fetal demise is identified and delivery for perinatal benefit would be considered if test results are abnormal. This may be as early as 24 weeks of gestation.

Based on these data and data from large series of high-risk pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>], 32 weeks of gestation has become a common threshold for initiation of fetal surveillance when an indication for fetal surveillance is present and the pregnancy is not complicated by multiple high-risk conditions or a condition strongly associated with early fetal demise (eg, severe growth restriction). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431172333\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal BPP score <span class=\"nowrap\">(10/10</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> without oligohydramnios) is repeated weekly or twice weekly until delivery when the high-risk condition persists and appears stable. Some experts recommend more frequent testing intervals, with individualization based on the high-risk clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. For example, severe growth restriction cause by uteroplacental insufficiency requires very close fetal monitoring. In one study, 48 growth-restricted fetuses &lt;32 weeks of gestation with umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index &lt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile underwent BPP daily and nonstress testing three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-fetal-biophysical-profile/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Ten of 27 fetuses with BPP scores of 8 developed nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings 3.5 to 24 hours after the BPP, and the repeat BPP score was 2 in all of these fetuses; three died in utero, seven were delivered promptly, and six of these neonates had acidemic umbilical artery blood gases at birth.</p><p>Any significant deterioration in the clinical status (eg, worsening preeclampsia, decreased fetal activity) requires reevaluation, regardless of the amount of time elapsed since the last test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437906117\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTE OF DELIVERY AFTER A LOW BPP SCORE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The positive predictive value of a low BPP score for intrapartum fetal compromise (eg, a nonreassuring fetal heart tracing, neonatal acidemia, or other markers of neonatal morbidity at the time of delivery) is approximately 50 percent, with a negative predictive value greater than 99.9 percent. The mode of delivery is an obstetric decision based on multiple variables including presentation, cervical findings, and maternal condition. In the absence of an obstetric contraindication, induction of labor with continuous intrapartum fetal heart monitoring is a reasonable option for most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455947132\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five fetal parameters used for determining the biophysical profile (BPP) score are heart rate accelerations in response to movement (nonstress test), breathing movement, body and limb movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume, as described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79813 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2732876210\" class=\"local\">'Assigning points'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A parameter may be assigned a normal score as soon as it is observed. The acute parameters (movement, tone, breathing) are subject to fetal sleep-wake cycles; therefore, the fetus should be observed continuously for at least 30 minutes before the parameter is assigned 0 points. (See <a href=\"#H972105269\" class=\"local\">'Duration of fetal observation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A score of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> without oligohydramnios is reassuring of fetal well-being; <span class=\"nowrap\">6/10</span> without oligohydramnios is an equivocal test result and should be repeated within 24 hours if the patient is not delivered; and 0 to <span class=\"nowrap\">4/10</span> suggests a high risk of fetal asphyxia within one week if the patient remains undelivered or no therapeutic intervention is undertaken. (See <a href=\"#H302709940\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scores of <span class=\"nowrap\">6/10</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> with oligohydramnios (0 points for amniotic fluid) are abnormal tests, as the risk of fetal asphyxia within one week is <span class=\"nowrap\">89/1000</span> with expectant management. These scores should be interpreted within the context of gestational age (eg, neonatal morbidity and mortality if the fetus is delivered) and maternal and obstetric factors (eg, risk of fetal death related to maternal, fetal, or obstetric disorder if the fetus is not delivered; whether cervix is favorable; maternal risks from continuing the pregnancy). A low BPP score in a high-risk patient requires the provider to consider the fetal and neonatal risks of expectant management versus delivery and deliver when the balance shifts to greater fetal risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78999\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78999 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H302709940\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimum gestational age for initiating testing should reflect the lower limit that intervention with delivery would be considered. We repeat a normal BPP score <span class=\"nowrap\">(10/10</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> without oligohydramnios) weekly or twice weekly until delivery when the high-risk condition persists and appears stable, and more frequently when there is significant deterioration in the clinical status (eg, worsening preeclampsia, decreased fetal activity) or in selected very high-risk settings (severe fetal growth restriction with abnormal Doppler velocimetry. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Testing schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In observational studies, use of the BPP score as part of the management of high-risk obstetric patients has been associated with a significant reduction in perinatal mortality. (See <a href=\"#H351730297\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predictive value of the four ultrasound biophysical parameters (movement, tone, breathing, amniotic fluid volume) is equivalent to that of the four ultrasound parameters plus a nonstress test when the four ultrasound parameters are normal (2 points for each). A nonstress test can be omitted if the BPP score is <span class=\"nowrap\">8/8</span> after ultrasound alone, but should always be performed if any ultrasound monitored parameter is 0. (See <a href=\"#H437905353\" class=\"local\">'Can the nonstress test be omitted?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The modified BPP simplifies the examination and reduces the time necessary to complete testing by focusing on those components of the BPP that are most predictive of outcome. Assessment of both amniotic fluid volume and the nonstress test appears to be as reliable a predictor of long-term fetal well-being as the full BPP.
