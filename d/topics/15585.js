Sepsis can happen in anyone, but it is more likely to happen in people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older or bedridden</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are staying in the hospital or have had recent surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have thin tubes such as catheters or IVs in their body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a weak infection-fighting system (for example because they are being treated for cancer)</p><p/><p>Sepsis can come from an infection in any part of the body, but it is most often linked to infections in the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lungs (called pneumonia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidneys (called urinary tract infection)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin (called cellulitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel (called colitis) &ndash; Sepsis caused by colitis is especially likely after a course of antibiotics.</p><p/><p>Sepsis needs to be treated quickly. If it is not treated, it can become severe. When this happens, it is called &quot;septic shock.&quot; Septic shock is life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12436502\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sepsis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of sepsis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever &ndash; But some people get a low body temperature instead of a fever.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing that is very fast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A heartbeat that is very fast</p><p/><p>Symptoms of severe sepsis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting confused or feeling light-headed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool clammy skin or red flushed skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor appetite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating much less than usual</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different types of skin rashes &ndash; One type is a lacy, purple rash that is usually on the legs, but can also be on the arms. Another rash looks like red or purple spots on the skin that do not go away when touched. These spots are usually on the chest and legs, but can also be in other areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other problems with the heart, kidneys, or brain</p><p/><p>People who have septic shock have many of the symptoms listed above, plus their blood pressure gets low and they sometimes pass out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12436517\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, as soon as possible. Sepsis can develop when you are at home or in the hospital. In either case, you (or the person with you) should call the doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever and chills, and have any of the symptoms above or look very sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had a recent surgery or hospital stay, and now are sick or have an infection</p><p/><p>If your doctor or nurse is unable to see you immediately, or you can't reach him or her, you should go to the nearest emergency room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12436532\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor will learn about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will likely do tests to look for an infection, see if the infection has spread to your blood, and see how serious your condition is. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests, including tests called &quot;blood cultures&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests &ndash; For example, if you are coughing up mucus, your doctor can test your mucus for bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of your body. These might include a test to look at your heart, called an echocardiogram (or &quot;echo&quot; for short).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12436547\"><span class=\"h1\">How is sepsis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis and septic shock are usually treated in the hospital with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics that go in your vein through a thin tube called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids that go in your vein through an IV</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines to treat your condition &ndash; For example, if your blood pressure is too low, your doctor can give you medicine to raise it.</p><p/><p>If an IV or catheter in your body is causing your sepsis, your doctor might take the IV or catheter out.</p><p>Some people are also treated with surgery. If you have a severe infection of the skin or tissue under the skin, your doctor might do surgery to remove the infected areas.</p><p>Some people with severe septic shock might need a blood transfusion. A blood transfusion is when a person gets blood that was given (donated) by another person. But this is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12436562\"><span class=\"h1\">Can sepsis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help prevent sepsis by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting treated right away if you get an infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding infections &ndash; One way to avoid infections is to get the vaccines your doctor recommends. Vaccines can prevent serious or deadly infections. If you have a child, make sure he or she gets the recommended vaccines, too.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12436577\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=splenectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Splenectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
