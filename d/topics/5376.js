As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy in a patient with long-standing diabetes mellitus who presents with classic &quot;stocking-glove&quot; sensory loss is relatively straightforward. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reasonable clinical hypothesis can be formed regarding the etiology of proximal weakness in patients taking drugs that can interfere with muscle function (eg, antimalarial, glucocorticoid, or cholesterol lowering medications). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced myopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>However, patients with disorders of nerves, muscle, or the neuromuscular junction can present with a similar constellation of symptoms. In addition, even when the process is localized to the nerve, it is not always clear if the origin of the problem is in the central or peripheral nervous system.</p><p>This topic will review the findings on history and physical examination that are characteristic of diseases of the nerve, muscle, and neuromuscular junction, and then present an approach to distinguishing central from peripheral neurologic disease. Specific neurologic syndromes are discussed in more detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN NERVE, MUSCLE AND NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diseases of the nerve (eg, polyneuropathy), muscle (eg, myopathy), and neuromuscular junction (eg, myasthenia gravis) may present with varying degrees of sensory loss and weakness. Nevertheless, specific patterns of the sensory and motor disturbance may help differentiate between these disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal sensory loss in the absence of a known central nervous system (CNS) lesion suggests a peripheral problem occurring somewhere along the length of the nerve between the nerve root and the most distal fibers. Identifying the distribution of sensory loss is paramount and is discussed in further detail below. The loss of certain modalities (eg, vibration or <span class=\"nowrap\">sharp/dull</span> discrimination) may also help identify the problem.</p><p>Weakness can arise from dysfunction of nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle. Weakness tends to be a difficult symptom for patients to quantify and localize. Frequently patients will complain of pain and associated weakness. However, since pain may limit the action and mobility of a joint, the finding of weakness in the setting of pain may not indicate true neurologic dysfunction. Patients who complain of painless weakness generally have significant abnormalities on examination. Similar to sensory loss, the distribution of weakness is extremely important. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Motor'</a> below.)</p><p>Cranial nerve complaints can be very useful in localizing the site of the problem. In the absence of CNS disease, diplopia is likely secondary to a neuromuscular junction defect. Progressive dysarthria without associated eye symptoms suggests motor neuron disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Less frequently, myopathies or acute motor polyneuropathies (such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) can present with dysarthria and eye movement abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neurologic examination should focus upon the distribution of muscle weakness and sensory loss and the deep tendon reflexes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distribution of muscle weakness is an important distinguishing feature. Proximal weakness is most consistent with a myopathy or neuromuscular junction disorder. Weakness in these individuals is usually symmetric, with involvement of head extensors and flexors, although mild asymmetries are not unusual. However, some patients with myasthenia may present with or develop predominately distal weakness. Repetitive movements may increase the weakness in myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the weakness involves predominantly only one extremity, it is useful to determine if the lesion is in the distribution of a single root, a region of the plexus, or a single nerve territory; this requires a detailed knowledge of the anatomy. The examination can be confounded if multiple lesions are superimposed in a single limb, eg, a simultaneous radiculopathy plus a focal mononeuropathy, or multiple mononeuropathies.</p><p>Observation of the muscles themselves is often helpful. Important features include the presence of fasciculations, whether the muscle produces a painful cramp after activation, and the presence of atrophy. Such findings may occur in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In axonal polyneuropathies, &quot;glove and stocking&quot; sensory loss is most prominent, initially affecting the feet and later the hands (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a>). Root lesions may cause sensory loss in a dermatomal pattern. Numbness in a single nerve territory might suggest an entrapment neuropathy. Multiple areas of numbness in different extremities point to a mononeuropathy multiplex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of reflexes suggests a neuropathic lesion, generally affecting either sensory or motor fibers. Globally depressed or absent reflexes are frequently associated with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>). Reflexes are generally preserved in muscle disease unless it is severe. Neuromuscular junction disorders do not follow a clear pattern: in myasthenia gravis reflexes are generally normal; in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, reflexes are reduced or absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bulbar and ocular signs suggest CNS disease, but if fluctuating or slowly progressive may point to a neuromuscular problem. Patients with myasthenia gravis, if presenting with limb weakness, will usually have a degree of diplopia and fatigable ptosis on examination of the extraocular muscles. Atrophy and fasciculations of the tongue may suggest ALS.</p><p>Checking the Tinel test, that is, tapping over a nerve to test for reproduction of pain and paresthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58010 \">picture 1</a>), might be helpful. A patient with intermittent numbness of the leg and a markedly positive Tinel sign over the fibular neck may have a peroneal neuropathy. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test is generally low (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Provocative maneuvers'</a>). Multiple Tinel signs can be present in patients with polyneuropathy; in one study the sensitivity and specificity of this finding was 79 and 42 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin findings may be subtle but can help identify the source of the problem. Distal hair loss over the feet is common in patients with polyneuropathy. A healing, painful dermatomal rash may point to a recent episode of herpes zoster (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postherpetic-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postherpetic neuralgia&quot;</a>). Unusual color changes with pain can point to complex regional pain syndrome accompanying a peripheral nerve lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Points of confusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some presenting symptoms may be difficult to interpret.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is generally not a prominent symptom of myopathy. Most myopathic processes are relatively painless, including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, toxic myopathies, and inclusion body myositis. Generally, muscle pain is confined to patients with acute rhabdomyolysis, a few metabolic myopathies (such as McArdle Disease), and myopathies associated with connective tissue disease (the pain perhaps secondary to joint involvement rather than muscle involvement itself).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myopathies may be superimposed upon polyneuropathies. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> can produce a severe myopathy, usually associated with a polyneuropathy. Patients with connective tissue diseases may also have both polyneuropathy and myopathy. In a critically ill patient who develops flaccid generalized weakness, the major considerations in the differential diagnosis are critical illness myopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy, or a combination of the two. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrary to standard teaching, proximal weakness is sometimes caused by nerve problems and distal weakness by myopathy. As an example, patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome occasionally present with proximal weakness secondary to predominant polyradiculopathy. On the other hand, some myopathies such as inclusion body myositis or myotonic dystrophy may cause significant distal weakness that is greater than proximal weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononeuropathy multiplex, when longstanding, can produce signs and symptoms suggestive of a polyneuropathy. The multiple mononeuropathies produce confluent sensory loss and weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTINGUISHING PERIPHERAL FROM CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diseases of the peripheral nervous system include the mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies, and mononeuropathy multiplex, each of which may be caused by a variety of underlying systemic illnesses, toxic exposures, and rheumatic genetic diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing peripheral from CNS disease (eg, that due to stroke, brain tumor, or spinal cord lesions) is straightforward in most cases. Weakness or sensory loss confined to one limb generally suggests a peripheral nerve problem. If there is associated pain in the extremity, then the likelihood of a peripheral process is even greater.</p><p>However, localization of the problem is less clear when weakness or sensory loss is no longer confined to one limb or when no associated <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/discomfort</span> is present. A patient who presents with painless sensory loss and numbness in the feet may have a polyneuropathy or a spinal cord lesion. Complaints of poor coordination or unsteady gait can also represent primarily central or peripheral dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important clues regarding the origin of nervous system complaints can be derived from asking detailed questions about pain, the time course of illness, and central nervous system dysfunction. Both central and peripheral nervous system disorders can be present simultaneously; in such a situation, even detailed questioning of a patient may not clarify the origin of the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extremity pain in addition to neurologic complaints is suggestive of a peripheral nervous system process. However, the presence of pain can be misleading. A number of central nervous system disorders can be accompanied by varying types of pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant number of patients develop a chronic pain syndrome several months to years after spinal cord injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Pain syndromes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with stroke can also experience extremity pain, particularly if the stroke was localized to the brainstem or thalamus. In most of these instances the pain affects the arm and leg on one side.</p><p/><p>Pain can originate from outside the nervous system, for example due to an arthritic joint. These patients may also complain of weakness secondary to the pain induced by movement of the joint or limb.</p><p>Pain that is position-dependent or brought on with activity (such as calf or thigh pain with walking in patients with spinal stenosis) is more likely of peripheral than central origin. In addition, pain that radiates into a very discrete area is unlikely to be central. However, random or diurnal fluctuations in pain are common in many peripheral and central disorders and may not help with localization of the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Time course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute onset of weakness or sensory loss in an awake, alert patient who is not performing an activity or maintaining an unusual posture is likely to be central in origin, while symptoms that come on after maintaining one position for a prolonged time are probably peripheral in origin. Examples of the latter include hand paresthesias while driving in a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome, and penile numbness after prolonged bicycling (secondary to compression of the pudendal nerve in the perineum). Disorders that develop over days or weeks, and those with onset during sleep, are more difficult to classify.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Other central nervous system disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms suggesting other CNS disease support a central origin of symptoms. Questions aimed at identifying central dysfunction may include whether the patient is experiencing any cognitive difficulties or subtle problems in additional extremities, subtle vision loss, nausea, vomiting, or headaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neurologic examination plays an important role in differentiating central and peripheral nervous system disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the deep tendon reflexes is the single most important test in determining whether a problem is peripheral or central. Brisk reflexes, especially if associated with a &quot;pathologic&quot; sign, such as the Babinski reflex or Hoffman's sign, suggest central pathology. Hyporeflexia or areflexia points to a peripheral problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation of the muscles may yield useful information before examining strength. Atrophy of muscles isolated to a specific root(s) or peripheral nerve places the problem in the peripheral nervous system. Mild disuse atrophy occurs in patients with motor lesions of the CNS, but severe reduction in muscle bulk is not typically observed with central lesions alone. Fasciculations suggest a peripheral process.</p><p>Increased tone on passive movement of the extremities suggests a CNS process. Side to side comparison is helpful in distinguishing subtle abnormalities. Normal or decreased tone is found in most peripheral processes.</p><p>Weakness caused by upper motor neuron (CNS) problems generally follows a specific pattern. Following a motor stroke, for example, extensor muscles in the arm (deltoid, triceps, wrist, and finger extensors) and flexor muscles in the leg (iliopsoas, hamstrings, and foot dorsiflexors) are weakest. Hemiplegia is straightforward to localize, but a patient with an incomplete spinal cord lesion who has only unilateral leg weakness may prove a greater diagnostic challenge.</p><p>Weakness caused by radiculopathy, plexopathy, or nerve entrapments is usually restricted to only a specific group of muscles. Rarely, however, a patient with a stroke may present with relatively isolated weakness, perhaps of just the hand.</p><p>Peripheral problems that cause generalized weakness often affect the neck extensor muscles prominently. As examples, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome can all produce marked neck extensor weakness. This pattern is very atypical in most central disorders.</p><p>Symmetric generalized weakness is more likely peripheral than central, and may suggest myopathy or diffuse polyneuropathy, although cervical myelopathy or brainstem lesions can also cause generalized weakness. Symmetric proximal weakness involving both the arms and legs is usually associated with myopathy or neuromuscular junction disease and is unlikely to be central in etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensory examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory loss that follows a specific nerve or root territory and can be brought on by position changes is suggestive of a peripheral process. Examples include numbness in the fingers with wrist flexion (Phalen maneuver) in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome or sensory loss over the lateral thigh with standing in patients with meralgia paresthetica.</p><p>Determining which sensory modalities are most affected is useful. A peripheral problem is more likely when all modalities are affected to some extent, although peripheral processes may also present with predominant loss of only one or two modalities (eg, reduced pain and temperature sensation in patients with a polyneuropathy affecting small unmyelinated fibers). Some central processes, such as syringomyelia, also may present with one or two modalities affected, such as reduced pain and temperature sensation and preserved light touch in the arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Coordination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal coordination without associated weakness suggests a central problem. A central process should also be considered if coordination is affected out of proportion to weakness. However, some patients with weakness due to peripheral nerve disease may have some degree of incoordination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Gait</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many central disorders are accompanied by changes in gait, such as the festinating gait of a patient with Parkinson disease, the hemiplegic gait of a patient with a stroke, or the &quot;frontal&quot; gait in a patient with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Gait disorders are often idiopathic or multifactorial in origin, especially in the elderly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic gait disorders of elderly people&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral disorders also occasionally have stereotypical gait abnormalities. A steppage gait, where the patient needs to lift the knees up high to overcome weakness in foot dorsiflexors, can be seen in patients with polyneuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. A waddling gait is characteristic of patients with proximal muscle weakness, as with myopathy. An antalgic gait occurs when posture and walking are altered in order to avoid or reduce pain. It arises from musculoskeletal rather than neurologic problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Cranial nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many generalized neuromuscular diseases affect the cranial nerves to some extent. Mild degrees of facial or bulbar weakness can be present in myopathies and neuromuscular junction disorders. Similar findings, including eye movement abnormalities, can be identified in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy (such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome).</p><p>Cranial nerve signs are often subtle (especially when symmetric), and may manifest themselves mainly as overactivation of the frontalis muscle, mild ptosis, or subtle eye movement abnormalities or nasality to the voice. Examination of the tongue for atrophy and fasciculations is also important, especially when considering the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Other important distinctions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of situations may present diagnostic dilemmas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient presenting with sensory loss or bilateral numbness and tingling in the feet, a polyneuropathy is the most likely explanation, but other causes are also possible. More commonly, lumbosacral polyradiculopathy (eg, from lumbar stenosis) can present with predominant distal sensory symptoms with little back or radiating pain or discomfort. Bilateral compression neuropathies (eg, bilateral peroneal or tibial neuropathies) occasionally affect the legs and need to be considered. Spinal cord problems, including degenerative disease or myelitis, can also present with primary distal lower extremity symptoms. Determining whether the symptoms are due to a central (eg, spinal cord) versus a peripheral process can usually be accomplished by neurologic examination. Hyperreflexia and increased tone suggest a central process, whereas reduced reflexes and normal tone suggest a peripheral process. Symmetric involvement (by history and examination) suggests polyneuropathy, while asymmetric findings generally suggest compression neuropathies or polyradiculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop the acute onset of painless unilateral hand and finger extension weakness may present a diagnostic dilemma. This pattern is typical of the distribution of upper motor neuron problems, although an acute radial neuropathy can produce identical signs. In radial neuropathy, however, the brachioradialis usually is also weak, a muscle not typically affected in stroke. Thus, examining the strength of this muscle (and its bulk during contraction compared with the normal side), can help make the distinction between these two entities. The brachioradialis flexes the elbow with the hand midway between pronation and supination and during contraction can be palpated radially in the proximal forearm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localizing the origin of a bladder problem based upon the history and examination can be difficult. Urgency and incontinence generally suggest upper motor neuron dysfunction. Patients with bladder difficulties from lower motor neuron problems typically present with weak streams and overflow incontinence. Distinguishing between these complaints can be challenging since many patients simply note an increased frequency of urination. Urodynamic studies may be useful when bladder difficulties are the predominant complaint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue is a nonspecific complaint that may be hard to sort out. It is important to clarify what the patient means by fatigue, as many individuals use fatigue as a synonym for &quot;sleepy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Generalized fatigue is usually not a symptom of peripheral nervous system disease, although it may be a sequela of polio (ie, post-polio syndrome) and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mechanism for fatigue in both of these peripheral disorders is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-polio-syndrome#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-polio syndrome&quot;, section on 'Fatigue'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weakness, not fatigue per se, tends to be the hallmark of most neuromuscular junction and muscle diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Many patients with CNS demyelination, as in multiple sclerosis, complain of fatigue.</p><p/><p>In patients with moderate or severe peripheral nervous system disease, a superimposed central process can be very difficult to identify. This was illustrated in a patient with diabetes mellitus and polyneuropathy who presented with progressive leg weakness, fever, and absent reflexes in the lower extremities, leading a clinician to suspect an acute polyneuropathy. After a prolonged evaluation, a thoracic epidural abscess producing a myelopathy was finally identified. A Babinski sign was absent due to atrophy of leg muscles and loss of sensory nerve fibers from chronic diabetic polyneuropathy. This suggests that when the end-organs are not working normally, a central process cannot be excluded by examination.</p><p>Even the most experienced neurologist may have difficulty correctly identifying a problem as peripheral or central. In most acute situations, it is more important to exclude a possible central process, since substantial neurologic recovery in the CNS is unlikely. As an example, excluding stroke is more important than eliminating a radial neuropathy in patients with hand weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of diagnostic tests are available to augment the history and physical examination in distinguishing between neurologic disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are the two most common diagnostic tests for establishing a diagnosis of nerve and muscle disease after the history and examination. It is often worth performing these tests prior to ordering additional blood tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies are tailored for patients individually; the clinician should carefully consider what they are looking for when referring a patient for these tests. The electromyographer should be given some background information, although too much data (eg, results of radiologic studies) may bias the examiner. Similarly, the referring physician should avoid narrowing the question too much; in a patient with proximal arm pain and hand numbness, asking to rule out only carpal tunnel syndrome may cause the electromyographer to miss a plexopathy or radiculopathy. The electromyographer typically performs a history and physical examination which can help tailor the study. Referral to a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist before performing <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> is useful in particularly complex or confusing cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superimposed processes may make interpretation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> difficult.

Nevertheless, EMG of the paraspinal muscles is usually not performed in these individuals to avoid the possibility of hematoma formation in this area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine nerve conduction studies are safe in patients with pacemakers, although high intensity proximal stimulation of nerves (for example, at Erb's point in the shoulder or stimulation at the root level) is avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> can only evaluate large, myelinated neurons. Only a few nerves in the arms (median, radial, and ulnar) and legs (posterior tibial, deep peroneal, and sural) are routinely studied. These nerves are easily accessible to stimulation and are frequently involved in neurogenic illness. However, many diseases, especially those which are painful, affect smaller myelinated or unmyelinated nerve fibers, and <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> may therefore be entirely normal. Thus, the absence of electrophysiologic evidence for a polyneuropathy does NOT mean that one does not exist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> is an uncomfortable test; occasionally patients are unable to complete a study. The electromyographer must make choices between one test and another to avoid excessive procedures. In addition, evaluation of motor units may be difficult if patients are not able to provide good effort (activation) on the EMG portion of the study. Explaining the procedure ahead of time may avoid some of these difficulties.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyographers may have very limited training or may perform studies infrequently, which can lead to variable results. One study found that repeat <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> resulted in a new diagnosis in 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of standard blood tests are available to help sort out peripheral nerve diseases.

The electrophysiologic features are often suggestive, but genetic testing is commercially available. A duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22) on chromosome 17 is the most common cause, although mutations on other chromosomes also exist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary polyneuropathy with predisposition to pressure palsies is a hereditary disease that is localized to the same gene as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 1a. Rather than a duplication of the gene, a deletion is present. These patients often have multiple entrapment neuropathies, including carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, and peroneal neuropathies at the fibular neck, superimposed upon a mild polyneuropathy. Abnormalities can be identified on EMG in asymptomatic individuals.

The length of the repeated CTG sequence correlates with the severity of disease. Genetic testing is also available for the less common myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), which is caused by a CTG repeat expansion on chromosome 3.

Identifying demyelination with associated inflammation in these individuals may help guide treatment. As examples, the detection of inflammatory cells within the myelin sheath will lead to the diagnosis of demyelinating polyneuropathy when the <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> findings were not clear cut. Alternatively, amyloid may be identified, or there may be loss of a population of nerve fibers in some &quot;small-fiber&quot; neuropathies in which mainly unmyelinated axons are affected. However, in many situations, nonspecific or only minimal abnormalities may be found.

Typical symptoms of small fiber neuropathy are distal burning, pain, numbness, and paresthesia. In patients with idiopathic painful distal sensory polyneuropathies who have a normal sural nerve biopsy, skin biopsy has demonstrated degeneration and loss of terminal nerve twigs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Skin biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452077357\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases of the nerve (eg, polyneuropathy), muscle (eg, myopathy), and neuromuscular junction (eg, myasthenia gravis) may present with varying degrees of sensory loss and weakness. The neurologic examination should focus upon the distribution of muscle weakness, sensory loss, and pathologic deep tendon reflexes. Symptoms and signs of cranial nerve dysfunction can be useful in localizing the site of the problem. Proximal weakness often, but not always, points to a myopathy or neuromuscular junction disorder. Focal sensory loss in the absence of a known central nervous system lesion suggests a peripheral problem. In axonal polyneuropathies, a &quot;glove and stocking&quot; pattern of sensory loss, initially affecting the feet and later the hands, is a common finding. Nerve root lesions may cause sensory loss in a dermatomal pattern. Numbness in a single nerve territory suggests an entrapment neuropathy. Multiple areas of numbness in different extremities point to mononeuropathy multiplex. The loss of reflexes suggests a neuropathic lesion, generally affecting either sensory or motor fibers. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical distinction between nerve, muscle and neuromuscular junction disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing peripheral from central nervous system (CNS) disease (eg, that due to stroke, brain tumor, or spinal cord lesions) is usually straightforward. Weakness or sensory loss confined to one limb generally suggests a peripheral nerve problem. The likelihood of a peripheral process is increased if there is associated pain in the extremity. However, localization is less clear when weakness or sensory loss involves more than one limb, or when <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/discomfort</span> is absent. In addition, a number of CNS disorders can be accompanied by varying types of pain. Examination of the deep tendon reflexes is the single most important test in determining whether a problem is peripheral or central. Brisk reflexes suggest central pathology. Hyporeflexia or areflexia points to a peripheral problem. Weakness caused by upper motor neuron (ie, CNS) problems generally follows a specific pattern in which weakness is predominant in extensor muscles in the arm (deltoid, triceps, wrist, and finger extensors) and flexor muscles in the leg (iliopsoas, hamstrings, and foot dorsiflexors). Increased tone on passive movement of the extremities also suggests a CNS process. Atrophy of muscles isolated to a specific root(s) or peripheral nerve places the problem in the peripheral nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing peripheral from central nervous system disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of diagnostic tests are available to augment the history and physical examination in distinguishing between neurologic disorders. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are among the most informative diagnostic tests for nerve and muscle disease. Genetic testing is also available for a number of illnesses. Muscle biopsy may assist in the accurate diagnosis of myopathy. For patients with polyneuropathy, nerve biopsy is occasionally helpful to define whether the process is predominantly axonal or demyelinating.
