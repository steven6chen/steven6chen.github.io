Commonly affected areas include the skull, spine, pelvis, and long bones of the lower extremity.</p><p>The majority of patients with PDB are asymptomatic. The diagnosis in such patients is usually made incidentally following a routine chemistry screen showing an elevated serum concentration of alkaline phosphatase of bone origin or an imaging study obtained for some other reason that shows pagetic changes in bone.</p><p>The two main clinical manifestations of Paget disease are pain due to the pagetic lesion in bone itself or from secondary consequences of bone overgrowth and deformities in affected areas, such as osteoarthritis or nerve impingement. Fractures, bone tumors, neurologic disease, and abnormalities in calcium and phosphate balance can also occur. In addition, because of the vascularity of pagetic bone, excessive bleeding may occur during orthopaedic surgery.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PDB will be reviewed here. The treatment of this disorder is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16031877\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paget disease of bone (PDB) is a fairly common finding in aging bone, with estimates ranging from 2.3 to 9 percent in older patients within affected populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; it is often asymptomatic. Its onset is typically after age 55, with a slight predominance in men in some but not all studies. It is common in England, Scotland, Central Europe, and Greece, as well as in countries and cities settled by European immigrants, such as those in Australia, Canada, and the United States. Even within these countries, there are geographical clusters of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>]. Paget disease is rarely reported in the Scandinavian countries and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-11</a>].</p><p>PDB is an ancient disease, claimed to be identified in a Neanderthal skull, with scattered reports of skeletal remains throughout history demonstrating this disorganized pattern of bone overgrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The recognition of both geographic and familial clusters of the disease led to a search for both environmental and genetic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/3,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16031884\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>The best initial estimates of prevalence came from two autopsy series in Europe performed during the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century on patients over the age of 40, in whom the prevalence was 3 to 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>]. In one series, only 7 of 24 patients recognized as having Paget disease had been diagnosed during their lifetimes (29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The prevalence may rise to as high as 9 percent in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over the last quarter-century, the prevalence of Paget disease appears to have diminished (except in regions of Italy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The extent of skeletal involvement is diminishing, and cases of symptomatic disease are less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/15,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19-23</a>].</p><p>Most of the estimates generated by epidemiological studies have relied upon the distribution of skeletal lesions, deriving prevalence estimates from reports of pagetic bone detected on screening abdominal radiographs (a &quot;KUB&quot; [kidneys, ureters, and bladder] view). Paget disease can affect almost any bone in the body but has a predilection for the skull, spine, pelvis, and long bones of the lower extremity. Thus, abdominal radiographs tend to capture the proximal femurs, pelvis, and lumbar spine (common sites of Paget disease) but miss patients with monostotic disease of the skull, upper spine, or distal extremity. Other epidemiological studies have relied on elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase (sAP) from bone as a marker for disease. However, a study of a population-based cohort from the Netherlands suggested that although sAP is a marker for PDB, the sAP level is normal in the majority of patients with Paget disease, particularly those with monostotic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Several issues are likely to have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of Paget disease, including the facts that it is often asymptomatic, that screening abdominal radiographs are no longer routine with hospital admission, and that the diminished skeletal extent of Paget disease has made it less likely to be incidentally detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16031884\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paget disease of bone (PDB), which is characterized by an accelerated rate of bone remodeling resulting in overgrowth of bone at selected sites and impaired integrity of affected bone, is believed to be a disease of the osteoclast. Osteoclasts are the only cell known to resorb bone. Osteoclast differentiation requires pathways involving receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mCSF), which are both necessary for osteoclast activation. RANKL binds to its receptor, RANK, on osteoclast precursors to promote osteoclast differentiation and activation via activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB)-dependent pathways. Osteoclast differentiation is modulated by cytokines and hormones and inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG; a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL). It is not known why some areas of bone are affected while others are not.</p><p>Evidence for the pivotal role of the osteoclast in PDB includes abnormalities in the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoclast phenotype:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The osteoclasts in pagetic bone demonstrate an unusual appearance, with a disproportionate number of osteoclasts with too many nucleoli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intranuclear inclusion bodies may be noted in the nuclei of pagetic osteoclasts, but not in the nuclei of osteoblasts or in osteoclasts from unaffected bone of the same patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoclast physiology:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Osteoclasts from patients with PDB show a hypersensitivity to vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antiresorptive agents used to treat PDB suppress osteoclastic activity and restore bone remodeling towards normal levels. Treatment with bisphosphonates can result in clinical remission of disease in many patients.</p><p/><p>Both genetic and environmental causes are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. While it is clear that genetic mutations underlie susceptibility, a marked decrease in prevalence that has been shown in Britain and New Zealand also supports a role for environmental determinants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. However, there are no consistent correlates found between the occurrence of Paget disease and varied environmental exposures, including exposure to measles, dog ownership, urban versus rural living, heavy metals, milk ingestion, or family size.</p><p>PDB occurs in both familial and sporadic forms. A positive family history may be elicited in 12 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/13,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,29</a>]. Persons with familial Paget disease may differ from those with sporadic Paget disease by having an earlier onset, more skeletal involvement, deformity, and fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16031891\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant evidence has accumulated that genetic factors influence the development of PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The inheritance of familial PDB appears to be autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene analyses have identified 15 genetic loci that are associated with PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. Most of these risk loci identify proteins known to affect bone physiology. Several directly affect RANK-RANKL pathway activity, such as the <em>TNFRSF11A </em>locus that encodes RANKL.</p><p>The first and best-documented genetic association is with mutations in the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of <em>SQSTM1</em>, which encodes the ubiquitin binding protein sequestosome-1. The <em>SQTSM1</em> P392L mutation<em> </em>was first identified in several French-Canadian kindreds with familial PDB. Study of familial cases from multiple countries has led to the identification of 28 different <em>SQSTM1 </em>mutations associated with PDB, of which P392L is by far the most common, occurring in up to 50 percent of familial PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Germline <em>SQSTM1</em> mutations have also been identified in 2.6 to 16 percent of sporadic PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], and somatic mutations have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>The presence of <em>SQSTM1</em> mutations, particularly truncation mutations, correlates with a more severe clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, of adults with <em>SQSTM1</em> mutations inherited from a parent with PDB, only 17 percent had evidence of PDB by bone scintigraphy, and their disease was attenuated compared with the affected parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This underscores the likely importance of gene-environment interactions for disease expression.</p><p>Many <em>SQSTM1</em> mutations enhance NFkB activation and thus osteoclast differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], while other mutations associated with PDB may affect the bone marrow microenvironment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Neither mice transgenic for human P392L <em>SQSTM1</em> nor mice with the equivalent mutation at the endogenous locus develop PDB, although their osteoclasts have some characteristics of pagetic osteoclasts (eg, enhanced responsiveness to RANKL and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This provides further evidence that <em>SQSTM1</em> mutation alone is insufficient to promote disease.</p><p>PDB is also observed in association with a rare disease characterized by inclusion body myopathy, PDB, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The causative mutation affects a valosin-containing protein that is associated with clathrin and may function to alter the process of proteasomal degradation. A transgenic mouse model has been described that develops lesions limited to muscle, bone, and brain, as described in human IBMPFD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>].</p><p>Three rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias have been described that share some features with PDB (enlarged osteoclasts, skeletal enlargement, and deformity) but have additional manifestations that render them clinically distinct, including age of onset, hearing loss, and early loss of adult teeth. Early-onset Paget disease, familial expansile osteolysis, and expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia are all caused by insertion mutations in the <em>TNFRSF11A</em> gene encoding RANKL and result in increased osteoclast activity.</p><p>A fourth disorder, called juvenile Paget disease (or hyperphosphatasia), is an autosomal recessive bone dysplasia with childhood onset that is unrelated to PDB in adults. Most reported cases are caused by a germline mutation in the gene for OPG, the decoy receptor for receptor activator for NFkB ligand (RANKL), leading to a deficiency of OPG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other skeletal syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16031898\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with the genetic findings, more limited information is available regarding potential environmental influences on PDB, including the possible role of viral infection. Findings of clusters of disease and observations that exposure to unvaccinated dogs, cats, or birds might be associated with a heightened risk of PDB led to the speculation that PDB might have a viral etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The evidence for measles virus as an etiologic factor is substantial, and measles vaccination is postulated to explain the declining incidence of PDB. However, while measles remains a problem worldwide where vaccinations have not reached vulnerable populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], PDB has not been described as more prevalent in these populations.</p><p>The possibility that viral infection may play an important early role in the genetically susceptible host remains controversial and continues to be investigated. Initial observations pointed to intranuclear inclusions in pagetic osteoclasts resembling paramyxoviruses, with a structure similar to the nucleocapsids of measles. The expression of measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP) in normal mouse osteoclasts promoted an osteoclast phenotype similar to pagetic osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>] and caused a significant PDB phenotype in the presence of a <em>SQSTM1</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. MVNP expression in osteoclasts has also been linked to increased osteoblast differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, immunohistochemical and molecular approaches to confirming the presence of virus in bone biopsies from PDB patients have generated conflicting findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3395682761\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifiable factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no known modifiable factors that contribute to PDB pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22843862\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The osteoclasts in patients with Paget disease of bone (PDB) are bizarre in appearance, multinucleated, and excessive in number. Accelerated bone turnover results in the abnormal deposition of lamellar bone interspersed with woven bone. The bone is disorganized in appearance, with variably thickened trabeculae rimmed by numerous osteoblasts. The characteristic mosaic pattern is formed by randomly arrayed units of lamellar bone, which are delineated by irregular cement lines. The disorganized woven bone increases the bone volume, leading to many of the complications of the disease. The normal marrow is replaced by highly vascular stromal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64880\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64880 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16031905\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with Paget disease of bone (PDB) are asymptomatic, although estimates vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. When symptoms do arise, these are usually due to overgrowth or deformity of the affected bone at a given skeletal location. Pain may arise either directly, from a pagetic lesion in bone, or from secondary causes, including osteoarthritis, nerve impingement, and tumor.</p><p>The two main clinical manifestations of Paget disease are pain, presumed to be due to the consequences of bone overgrowth, and deformities in affected areas. However, fractures, bone tumors, neurologic disease, and abnormalities in calcium and phosphate balance can also occur. Intrinsic cardiac disease due to PDB directly does not occur, but extensive polyostotic disease has rarely been associated with high-output heart failure as a secondary phenomenon. In addition, because of the vascularity of pagetic bone, excessive bleeding may occur during orthopaedic surgery.</p><p>Pain due to pagetic involvement of bone generally develops later in the course of disease and is typically a mild to moderate, deep, aching discomfort that persists through the day and at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It may worsen with weightbearing and may be present at night. The etiology of the pain associated with the changes in bone is unclear. It may be due to periosteal changes caused by bone enlargement in association with hyperemia or microfractures in weightbearing bones.</p><p>The frequency of clinical findings depends upon the population studied (eg, registry versus clinical trial population, or the age of the study patients) and the methods by which data are obtained (eg, by patient or clinician questionnaires or by chart review) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/22,63,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,63,67-69</a>]; thus, estimates of different manifestations vary widely. The reason for this relates to the tendency of patients with Paget disease to be older adults and to assign their musculoskeletal complaints to this disorder of bone.</p><p>Symptoms and findings likely to be related to PDB among two cohorts of patients included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/63,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,68</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis (40 to 50 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain (40 to 45 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone deformity (12 to 36 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture (4 to 16 percent)</p><p/><p>Other problems that may be attributed to PDB include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/22,63,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,63,67-69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiculopathy due to nerve compression syndromes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired functional status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint replacement surgery</p><p/><p>Paget disease has a predilection for the skull, thoracolumbar spine, pelvis, and long bones of the lower extremities.

Enlargement of the skull, which can occur after many years of disease, may lead to a &quot;tam-o-shanter&quot; shape radiographically and may result in basilar invagination. Involvement of the mandible or maxillary bones may result in jaw deformity, malocclusion, and periodontal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71522\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71522 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. Angioid streaks can be found on ophthalmologic examination in up to 20 percent of patients with skull involvement as a component of active and more extensive Paget disease, compared with 15 percent of patients with active disease regardless of location and less than 2 percent of nonselected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].

The abnormal bone may lead to a crippling compression fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51562 \">image 2</a>). In the pelvis, Paget disease is often asymptomatic, unless it abuts a joint where softening of the bone may lead to pain, arthritis, and protrusio acetabuli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62514\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62514 \">image 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long bones &ndash; Bowing deformities in the long bones and early arthritis of affected joints are common, with a heightened risk of fracture over the lifetime of the individual. The deformities are caused by enlarging and abnormally contoured bones, which result in bowing; the tibia and femur typically bow anteriorly and anterolaterally, respectively. Bowing may result in changes in gait and increased mechanical stresses that increase the likelihood of back and joint pain and of osteoarthritis. Patients with PDB have an increased likelihood of undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis compared with non-pagetic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The skin overlying involved areas may feel warm due to increased blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Traumatic and pathologic fractures are the most common complications of pagetic lesions in the long bones. Femoral fractures are more frequent than tibial fractures. The most common femoral site is in the area below the lesser trochanter. Fractures are usually transverse and perpendicular to the cortex. They can be either complete or incomplete (fissure fractures). Fissure fractures tend to occur along the convex surfaces of the curved bones but may progress to become complete fractures over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/66,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,74</a>].

A complete understanding of the locations of skeletal involvement is essential to determining indications for treatment. Note that the sites involved rarely change over a patient's lifetime. Findings on bone scans, however, are not specific, and plain film imaging of areas of increased uptake needs to be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. PDB-related changes on bone scan sometimes antedate corresponding findings on plain radiographs.</p><p>In a patient with known Paget disease, where bone scintigraphy is performed to assess the extent, distribution, and activity of disease, we obtain plain radiographs to confirm involvement at additional sites and evaluate for other bone lesions.

Its onset is typically after age 55, with a slight predominance in men. It is common in England, Scotland, Central Europe, and Greece, as well as in countries and cities settled by European immigrants. Within these countries, there are geographical clusters of disease. Estimates of prevalence in some populations range from 3 percent in patients over 40 to up to 9 percent in older adults. (See <a href=\"#H16031877\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDB is characterized by abnormalities of the osteoclast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]; there are accelerated bone turnover and abnormal bone remodeling. Both genetic and environmental causes are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. Inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, and multiple genetic loci have been associated with PDB. A pathogenic role for viral infection remains controversial. (See <a href=\"#H16031884\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16031891\" class=\"local\">'Genetic'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16031898\" class=\"local\">'Viral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22843862\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with PDB are asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually due to overgrowth of the affected bone. Pain may arise directly, from a pagetic lesion in bone, or from secondary causes, including osteoarthritis, fracture, nerve impingement, or, rarely, tumor. Paget disease has a predilection for the skull, thoracolumbar spine, pelvis, and long bones of the lower extremities. The common clinical manifestations include bone pain or chronic back pain, bone deformities, and arthritis, and depend upon the region involved. (See <a href=\"#H16031905\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteosarcoma is a rare, usually fatal complication of PDB, which typically presents in those with longstanding skeletal disease. Such patients may report increased bone pain that is poorly responsive to medical therapy, local swelling, and, less often, a pathologic fracture. Giant cell tumors may arise in pagetic bone and are usually benign. (See <a href=\"#H21530713\" class=\"local\">'Bone tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings, which reflect increased bone turnover and are typical of untreated disease, include elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (sAP) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP). The degree of elevation generally reflects the extent and activity of the disease, although this is not always the case. A normal or minimally elevated alkaline phosphatase may be seen in more limited disease. Serum calcium and phosphorus are normal in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H22843916\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs reflect the abnormal bone turnover characteristic of disease. A predominantly osteolytic lesion may be seen early in disease. Over time, however, there is evidence of an osteoblast response, and the bone thickens and enlarges, with thickened cortices marked by tunneling and accentuated trabeculae at one or more affected skeletal sites. In late disease, there may be dense bone by plain film, with little evidence of remodeling by biochemical parameters. Increased uptake is seen focally at the sites of active pagetic bone lesions on radionuclide bone scanning. Bone scintigraphy is more sensitive than plain radiography, particularly in early disease. (See <a href=\"#H22844044\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiographs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22844233\" class=\"local\">'Bone scintigraphy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of PDB in patients with clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of disease is confirmed by the demonstration of characteristic radiographic changes. In most patients, the sAP is elevated, and additional tests of bone turnover are not required. We obtain a baseline radionuclide bone scan to document the extent and locations of skeletal involvement; we perform radiographs of affected sites to identify impending fractures, potential malignant lesions, osteoarthritis, or other bone abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H16031919\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27501186\" class=\"local\">'Role of imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27501193\" class=\"local\">'Role of biochemical studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDB occurs in an aging population that also has an increased prevalence of malignancy, osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis. Although the diagnosis of PDB is usually evident from radiographic findings, other conditions may also be present or may have overlapping features. (See <a href=\"#H21530746\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2969071629\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Margaret Seton, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Altman RD, Bloch DA, Hochberg MC, Murphy WA.
