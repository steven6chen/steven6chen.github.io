Inflammation can make blood vessel walls thick, weak, narrow, or scarred. In Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, these changes can happen in blood vessels all over the body. This can lead to different types of symptoms.</p><p>Doctors don't know what causes Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. It happens most often in adults age 20 to 40.</p><p>Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is a lifelong disease. Symptoms can come and go over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865081127\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open sores (called &quot;ulcers&quot;) in the mouth &ndash; These sores can be very painful. They usually go away on their own, but then often come back later on.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open sores on the genitals &ndash; These sores can be very painful. They usually happen on the scrotum (the skin sac between the legs) in men or on the vulva (the area around the vagina) in women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye inflammation (called &quot;uveitis&quot;) &ndash; This can cause eye redness or pain, or blurred vision. If the eye inflammation isn't treated, it can lead to blindness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis, which is joint pain and swelling &ndash; This commonly affects the knees, ankles, or wrists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin symptoms &ndash; These can include bumps, rashes, or acne-like symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive symptoms &ndash; These happen when ulcers form in the digestive tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). Symptoms can include lack of appetite, nausea, belly pain, or diarrhea.</p><p/><p>People with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome can have other symptoms, too. These can affect the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, or other parts of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865081165\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Beh&ccedil;et syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no test that can tell for sure whether you have Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. To figure out whether you have the disease, your doctor or nurse will ask about all of your symptoms and do an exam. He or she might also order blood tests to make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865081180\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Beh&ccedil;et syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. But medicines can help ease and control your symptoms. They can also help prevent long-term problems from the disease. The medicines that are right for you will depend on your symptoms and how severe your disease is.</p><p>In general, doctors use the following medicines to treat Beh&ccedil;et syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a> &ndash; These medicines reduce and control inflammation. Because steroid medicines can cause serious side effects, doctors try to give them for as short a time as possible. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">colchicine</a>, which helps reduce pain and swelling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that calm down or &quot;turn off&quot; the body's immune (infection-fighting) system</p><p/><p>Other treatment depends on the part of the body affected. For example, eye inflammation is also treated with eye drops or other medicines that go in the eye.</p><p>People with certain blood vessel problems might need treatment other than medicines. For example, if a blood vessel wall gets too thin and bulges out, it might need to be fixed with surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865081195\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. Some medicines for Beh&ccedil;et syndrome are not safe to take if you are pregnant. You might need to get your symptoms under control or switch medicines before you try to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865081210\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will need regular exams and tests to check for the problems Beh&ccedil;et syndrome can cause. It is important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and tell your doctor or nurse if you have any side effects. The right treatment can help you control your symptoms and stay as healthy as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865081225\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vasculitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uveitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
