(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Glomerular proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p>The proteinuria in glomerular disease is due to increased filtration of macromolecules (such as albumin) across the glomerular capillary wall. The latter consists of three components: the fenestrated endothelial cell, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and the epithelial cell foot processes. The pores between the foot processes are closed by a thin membrane called the slit diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72505 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The filtration of macromolecules across the glomerular capillary wall is normally restricted by two mechanisms: charge-selectivity and size-selectivity. The endothelial cells and the GBM have a net negative charge due to polyanions such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This creates a charge barrier to the filtration of large anions such as albumin. In comparison, circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) is predominantly neutral or cationic, and its filtration is not limited by charge.</p><p>In MCD, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, there is a loss of anionic charge that is not accompanied by any structural damage or change to the glomerular filtration unit observed by light microscopy. However, electron microscopy demonstrates epithelial podocyte effacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58414 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The glomerular capillary wall is size-selective, having functional pores of an approximate radius of 40 to 45 A (the radius of albumin is roughly 36 A). These pores appear to be located throughout the GBM and across the GBM at the slit diaphragms between the adjacent epithelial cell foot processes. In comparison, the width of the endothelial cell fenestrae is much larger (375 to 400 A); as a result, the endothelial cell is not part of the size barrier to macromolecule filtration.</p><p>In glomerular diseases other than MCD, structural injury seen by light microscopy results in an increase in the number of large pores in the GBM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76597 \">figure 1</a>). This structural damage allows movement of normally restricted proteins of varying sizes (including large neutral proteins, such as IgG) across the filtration barrier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this discussion, children with nephrotic syndrome are classified based upon whether or not there are signs of systemic disease.

Thus, it is often used as a screening test while awaiting confirmation by quantitative protein excretion studies.</p><p>Patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome have a relatively inactive urine sediment (ie, oval fat bodies and hyaline casts, but few red cells and no red cell or other cellular casts). Hematuria is commonly seen in patients with glomerulonephritis, but does occur in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and less commonly occurs with MCD. This was illustrated in the previously mentioned International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) study of 521 children who presented with primary nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
