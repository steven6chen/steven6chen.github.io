In addition, glucocorticoids increase fracture risk, and fractures occur at higher bone mineral density (BMD) values than occur in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The increased risk of fracture has been reported with doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent as low as 2.5 to 7.5 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, glucocorticoid-induced bone loss should be treated aggressively, particularly in those already at high risk for fracture (older age, prior fragility fracture). In other individuals, clinical risk factor and bone density assessment may help guide therapy. The prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss will be reviewed here. The clinical features are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of the prevention and treatment strategies for glucocorticoid-induced bone loss are similar to those used to prevent and treat other causes of osteoporosis.

Therefore, calcium supplementation may attenuate bone loss in patients taking glucocorticoids. In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials comparing calcium and vitamin D (cholecalciferol or an active vitamin D metabolite) with calcium alone or placebo in patients taking glucocorticoids, there was significant improvement in lumbar spine and radial bone mineral density (BMD) in the calcium and vitamin D group (weighted mean difference between treatment and control groups 2.6 and 2.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The between-group difference in the annual rate of change in BMD was 2.65 percent (95% CI 0.73-4.57) and 2.08 percent (95% CI 0.43-3.73) for the spine and trochanter, respectively, favoring calcium and vitamin D supplementation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although calcium and vitamin D supplementation is necessary, it is generally not sufficient to prevent bone loss and fracture in patients taking high-dose glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Pharmacologic therapy is often required. (See <a href=\"#H622797\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for pharmacologic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active vitamin D metabolites</strong> &ndash; Vitamin D metabolites that are more active than vitamin D itself, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfacalcidol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alfacalcidol</a>, have been evaluated for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the most active metabolite of vitamin D) plus calcium protects against spine bone loss more than calcium alone in patients taking glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. A meta-analysis of five trials of active vitamin D metabolites in patients exposed to corticosteroids reported a beneficial effect of vitamin D metabolites on lumbar spine BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There were insufficient data to address fracture prevention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Active vitamin D metabolites are less commonly used, however, because of the risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in patients whose urinary calcium excretion is already increased and because more effective therapies are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The superior efficacy of bisphosphonates compared with an active vitamin D metabolite for preventing glucocorticoid-induced bone loss has been demonstrated in several randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. Although not statistically significant, one trial showed that compared with alfacalcidiol, fewer patients randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> had new vertebral fractures (three versus eight patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

As an example, for patients with clinical risk factors for fracture, low lumbar spine BMD, but normal femoral neck BMD, FRAX is likely to underestimate fracture risk. This situation is especially likely in patients taking glucocorticoids, which are more likely to cause osteoporosis of the spine than of the hip. Thus, intervention guidelines with or without the use of FRAX provide only general clinical guidance.
