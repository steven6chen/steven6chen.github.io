Names often used interchangeably but not always accurately, have included hypersensitivity angiitis, drug-induced vasculitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, serum sickness, serum sickness-like reactions, and allergic vasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will present an overview of CSVV as a single-organ vasculitis limited to the skin. The evaluation and management of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-adults-with-idiopathic-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of adults with idiopathic cutaneous small vessel vasculitis&quot;</a>). An overview of the approach to the vasculitides is also presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p><strong>Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis</strong> &ndash; Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) is defined as a single-organ, skin-isolated leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) or angiitis without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>It is important to note that the same cutaneous presentation can be seen in many other systemic small vessel vasculitides such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis), cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]) as well as other conditions such as infective endocarditis. When a patient presents with palpable purpura that reveals LCV on biopsy, the patient must be evaluated for a variety of causes and associated conditions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>). Further delineation of etiology can only be done by integrating the clinical presentation, and in some cases (such as IgAV [HSP]), the presence or absence of vascular immunoglobulin deposition on skin biopsy. Some patients who are diagnosed initially as having a single organ cutaneous LCV can later develop a systemic form of small vessel vasculitis.</p><p>Other terms that have been used interchangeably with CSVV, but should be considered separately are defined below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leukocytoclastic vasculitis</strong> &ndash; LCV is a histopathologic term that defines vasculitis of the small vessels in which the inflammatory infiltrate is composed of neutrophils. After degranulation, neutrophils undergo death and break down, a process named leukocytoclasia, releasing nuclear debris, also described as nuclear dust.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity vasculitis </strong>&ndash; Hypersensitivity vasculitis is a term originally used by Pearl Zeek in 1948 to differentiate small vessel necrotizing vasculitis attributed to a hypersensitivity reaction from the classic polyarteritis nodosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>). Distinguishing features included prominent involvement of the skin, and the observation that the condition frequently appeared to be caused by a presumed &ldquo;hypersensitivity&rdquo; to serum or drugs. However, this term has fallen out of favor since the Chapel Hill 1994 consensus on the classification of vasculitides excluded the term because of a lack of specificity of clinical (palpable purpura) and histologic presentation (LCV), as well as the inability to describe the precise immune mechanism that caused the small vessel vasculitis. Patients who previously would have been classified as having hypersensitivity vasculitis are now diagnosed with cutaneous small vessel vasculitis if vasculitis is limited to the skin, or with another type of specific small vessel vasculitis if there is evidence of systemic involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum sickness</strong> &ndash; Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reaction are terms that are often used inconsistently. Historically, they have been applied to a clinical pathologic syndrome occurring 8 to 12 days after exposure to a therapeutic administration of foreign proteins. Consensus opinion would apply the diagnostic term &ldquo;serum sickness&rdquo; to the development of a rash (generally urticarial, morbilliform, or even angioedema), arthralgia, arthritis, and fever occurring 5 to 14 days after foreign protein, protein-based therapeutic biologic, or other drug exposure. Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune complex small vessel vasculitis</strong> &ndash; Immune complex small vessel vasculitis refers to vasculitis associated with immune complex <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement deposition, predominantly affecting small vessels. If limited to the skin, this is identical to cutaneous small vessel vasculitis. However, other systemic manifestations may occur, such as glomerulonephritis. When appropriate, immune complex vasculitis can be characterized as vasculitis associated with probable etiologies such as cryoglobulinemic vasculitis related to hepatitis C, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, or rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other examples of immune complex small vessel vasculitis include antiglomerular basement membrane disease, IgAV (HSP), and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults#H262394612\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;, section on 'Immune complex small-vessel vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOPATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many medications can cause cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV), but penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides (including most loop and thiazide-type diuretics), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> have been most often implicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81148 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Drugs may act as haptens to stimulate an immune response. Certain infections, such as hepatitis due to hepatitis B or C virus, chronic bacteriemias (eg, infective endocarditis, infected shunts), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other viruses, may also be associated with CSVV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>CSVV is often mediated by immune complex deposition in the small vessels. Evidence for circulating immune complex formation includes the detection of soluble complexes, hypocomplementemia in many patients (but not immunoglobulin A vasculitis [IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (HSP)]), and the deposition of immune reactants in vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical findings include palpable purpura (0.3 to 1 cm diameter) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> petechiae (purpuric lesions less than 3 mm in diameter) that are nonblanching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F94489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94489 \">picture 1</a>). Sometimes these lesions coalesce, ulcerate, or are surrounded by hemorrhagic bullae. When the inciting agent is a drug or infectious agent, most patients develop symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> findings beginning 7 to 10 days after antigen exposure, which is the time required to produce a sufficient quantity of antibody to produce antigen-antibody complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the latent period may be as short as two to seven days with a secondary antigen exposure, or may be longer than two weeks with a long-acting drug such as benzathine G penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>By definition, in cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) there is no visceral organ involvement. However, visceral involvement can occur later in the disease course, revealing a systemic small vessel vasculitic process. </p><p>In cases of immune complex-mediated vasculitis when the inciting agent persists, such as in hepatitis C-related cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis, chronic vasculitis can be observed, with waxing and waning lesions or persistent lesions of different ages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p>The diagnosis of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) is usually suggested by the clinical findings and by the history of an offending drug or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement deposition are found on immunofluorescence, an immune complex mechanism is suggested as a cause. The absence of immune complex deposition may be due to late timing of biopsy relative to onset of skin lesion, or may be associated in some cases (but not always) with a pauciimmune type of vasculitis such as microscopic polyangiitis. If IgA deposition is noted on immunofluorescence microscopy of the skin lesion biopsy, and there is a history of joint or gastrointestinal symptoms, an assessment of urine sediment should take place and be repeated on subsequent visits. Some authors use the term Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (HSP) synonymously with immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369682248\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the patient with cutaneous lesions suspicious for vasculitis is directed at addressing these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is this vasculitis?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the cause?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are other organs involved? </p><p/><p>A history of new drugs and associated comorbidities (eg, infections, hepatitis C, or a systemic rheumatic disease) should be ascertained.</p><p>A comprehensive history and detailed physical examination should also be performed to determine whether the process is truly skin-limited, and that no organ-threatening systemic disease coexists. While the patient may only complain of the skin rash, more ominous damage, potentially irreversible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening, can coexist in other organs, such as alveolar hemorrhage, glomerulonephritis, mesenteric ischemia, or mononeuritis multiplex. Particular attention must be paid to potential organs targeted in small vessel vasculitis such as, but not limited to: lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and peripheral and central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369682045\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of an underlying systemic disease must always be considered in a patient presenting with lesions suspicious for cutaneous vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59048 \">table 2</a>). Suggested laboratory tests are discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis#H16172005\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Additional studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369682051\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous lesions suspicious for vasculitis should be biopsied in almost all patients. Some experts feel that not all children need to have a biopsy performed. The pattern of cutaneous pathology and immunology is highly sensitive to the timing of the biopsy and the age of the lesion, with the lesions between 24 to 48 hours old preferred for biopsy. The core histological features on biopsy are infiltration with polymorphonuclear neutrophils in and around the vessel walls, with signs of activation, degranulation, and death of neutrophils illustrated by leukocytoclasia (nuclear dust); evidence of tissue damage (extravasated red blood cells, damaged endothelial cells, and occasionally necrosis of skin appendages); and fibrinoid necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F94489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94489 \">picture 1</a>). A biopsy sample may also be sent for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies, but this specimen should be taken from the newest lesion that is able to be identified. A detailed discussion of the biopsy of patients with cutaneous vasculitis is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis#H16171991\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) may be impossible to distinguish from other forms of systemic vasculitis, unless other manifestations are present. In addition, palpable purpura and petechial lesions can also be present in other conditions. Examples of conditions that may present with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic vasculitides such as microscopic polyarteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener&rsquo;s), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]), other systemic immune complex vasculitides, and polyarteritis nodosa (including that due to hepatitis B), may occasionally present with predominantly cutaneous involvement, such as palpable purpura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59048 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura may, at times, be the presentation of paraneoplastic or malignancy-associated forms of vasculitis frequently due to a lymphoproliferative disease. These patients tend to have chronic purpura, often treatment-resistant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same process of red cell extravasation associated with purpuric skin lesions seen in vasculitis can be caused by noninflammatory vascular damage such as in scurvy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cholesterol emboli, actinic and senile purpura, or glucocorticoid-induced purpura; or by coagulation and platelet disorders such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.</p><p/><p>A more comprehensive list of differential diagnoses can be found elsewhere.

For cases in which the cause is thought to be due to a drug, discontinuation of the inciting drug or antigen should lead to resolution within a period of days to a few weeks. The recognition of CSVV due to an ongoing infection is also important since the administration of immunosuppressive medications may be harmful. In such cases, treatment should be aimed at the underlying infection, such as the administration of antibiotics for patients with endocarditis or antivirals for patients with hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p>Occasionally, patients develop persistent symptoms which may require systemic immunomodulatory drugs.
