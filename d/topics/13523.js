Sirolimus (Rapamune, rapamycin) is a macrocyclic triene antibiotic that is produced by fermentation of <em>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</em>. Sirolimus was discovered from a soil sample collected in Rapa Nui, which is also known as Easter Island [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-mammalian-mechanistic-target-of-rapamycin-mtor-inhibitors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although it was originally developed as an antifungal agent, it was later found to have immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties that may be useful to treat or prevent proliferative diseases such as tuberous sclerosis, psoriasis, and malignancy. In April 2010, everolimus (Zortress), an analog of sirolimus and macrolide immunosuppressive agent, was approved by the FDA.</p><p>The pharmacology of the mTOR inhibitors and their use and efficacy in renal transplant recipients will be reviewed here.
