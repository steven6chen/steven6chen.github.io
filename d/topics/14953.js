Of the plasma calcium, approximately 40 percent is bound to albumin; 15 percent is complexed with citrate, sulfate, or phosphate; and 45 percent exists as the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium. As routinely measured in the laboratory, the plasma calcium concentration includes all of the calcium in the plasma (free and bound). In general, measuring the total plasma calcium concentration is sufficient since changes in this parameter are usually associated with parallel changes in the ionized concentration. Exceptions to this commonly occur in patients with hypoalbuminemia, acid-base disorders, and chronic kidney disease. Issues surrounding the measurement of total and ionized calcium are presented elsewhere in detail. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In comparison with calcium, plasma phosphorus exists in both organic and inorganic forms, including phospholipids, ester phosphates, and inorganic phosphates. Inorganic phosphates are completely ionized, circulating primarily as HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in a ratio of 4:1 at a plasma pH of 7.40.</p><p>Only a small fraction of the total body calcium and phosphate is located in the plasma. However, it is the plasma concentrations of ionized calcium and inorganic phosphate that are under hormonal control. Calcium balance is mediated primarily by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which affect intestinal absorption, bone formation and resorption, and urinary excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Phosphorus balance is also primarily regulated by PTH but may also respond to fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and its cofactor, klotho, which together and separately promote renal excretion of phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The physiologic roles of other hormones (such as calcitonin and estrogens) in the regulation of calcium and phosphate balance are incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451092772\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCIUM HANDLING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451092737\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal calcium handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary calcium is absorbed by two mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An active, transcellular pathway via the transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) channel on the apical membrane of the duodenum and proximal jejunum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paracellular calcium transport that occurs throughout the length of the intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p>In contrast to the complete absorption of dietary sodium, potassium, and chloride in the gastrointestinal tract, the absorption of calcium and phosphate is incomplete due to two factors: Activated vitamin D (ie, calcitriol) is required for intestinal calcium absorption (see <a href=\"#H451093840\" class=\"local\">'Effect of vitamin D on calcium'</a> below), and calcium combines with certain anions in the intestinal lumen to form insoluble salts (such as calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate) that are not absorbed. As an example, a normal adult may ingest 1000 mg of calcium per day, of which approximately 400 to 500 mg may be absorbed. In addition, 300 mg of calcium are lost into the stool via digestive secretions. Thus, of 1000 mg of ingested calcium, the net absorption is only 100 to 200 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Bone is a calcium reservoir that is involved in maintaining a normal plasma ionized calcium concentration; this process depends upon the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which are regulated by many hormones and proteins, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol.

Approximately 70 percent is reabsorbed passively in conjunction with sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Approximately 20 percent is reabsorbed in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH) through a passive, paracellular mechanism mediated by the tight junction protein, claudin-16 (in conjunction with claudin-19 and interacting with claudin-14), which acts as a channel for divalent cation reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The major driving force for this transport event is a lumen-positive potential that is generated by the backflux of potassium (and, to a lesser extent, sodium) from cells of the TALH to the lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F94326\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94326 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Reabsorption of the remaining 10 to 15 percent of calcium<sup> </sup>occurs in the distal nephron through a transcellular mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast to the passive reabsorption occurring in more proximal nephron segments, distal calcium<sup> </sup>handling is active and is responsible for physiologic calcium<sup> </sup>regulation as well as the dysregulation observed in many disease states. Calcium enters tubular cells via the transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) channel, which is expressed on the apical membrane of both distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>].

There, calcium is finally extruded into the circulation via two channels, NCX1 (a <span class=\"nowrap\">3Na/Ca</span> exchanger) and PMCA1b (a Ca-ATPase) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F98566\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98566 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451093172\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF PLASMA CALCIUM CONCENTRATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum calcium<sup> </sup>concentration is regulated by multiple hormonal pathways including parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), calcitonin, and estrogen.

In addition, PTH increases the expression of the calcium transport proteins, TRPV5, calbindin-D28k, NCX1, and PMCA1b, in the distal nephron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], which also enhances renal calcium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanism by which PTH enhances calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH) is not clearly defined. However, one study has found that PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling directly and indirectly regulates the paracellular calcium transport pathway by inhibiting claudin-14 expression in the TALH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In animals lacking the PTH receptor in the TALH, claudin-14 protein expression markedly increases, leading to reduced calcium reabsorption. Conversely, blocking expression of claudin-14 by gene deletion reverses the hypercalciuria and hypocalcemia of parathyroid-deficient animals. The mechanism of distal calcium reabsorption is presented above. (See <a href=\"#H451093073\" class=\"local\">'Renal calcium handling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Small elevations in the plasma calcium concentration act as negative feedback in these processes by binding to the CaSR on parathyroid glands, thereby decreasing PTH secretion. In addition, an increase in calcitriol inhibits production and secretion of PTH by the parathyroid gland.

Cholecalciferol is hydroxylated in the 25 position by the hepatic enzyme, 25-hydroxylase, resulting in the formation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is also known as calcidiol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calcidiol then enters the circulation (bound by vitamin D-binding protein), is filtered by the glomerulus, and is then reabsorbed by the tubule. Studies in vitamin D-deficient animals suggest that the proximal tubule is the important site of calcitriol synthesis. However, studies in the normal human kidney under conditions of vitamin D sufficiency indicate that the distal nephron is the predominant site of 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Here, calcidiol enters one of two pathways: the 1-alpha-hydroxylase pathway that produces the most active form of vitamin D (calcitriol [1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D]) or the 24-alpha-hydroxylase pathway to form the inactive metabolite, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The sodium-dependent transport depends, in part, upon the NaPi-IIb transport protein, but the nature of the sodium-independent pathway (transcellular or paracellular route) is uncertain.

As an example, in patients with a primary disturbance in proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption, such as those with hereditary NAPI-IIc transport protein deficiency, feeding large amounts of phosphate causes only a minimal increase in steady state serum phosphate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, although acute cellular uptake of phosphate may transiently reduce serum levels (such as might occur following acute episodes of respiratory alkalemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], steady state concentrations are most dependent upon rates of renal reabsorption. Phosphate reabsorption depends upon dietary phosphate intake, serum phosphate concentrations, and the activity of parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF-23 and other phosphatonins, and active vitamin D (calcitriol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low dietary phosphate intake or low serum phosphate levels increase both synthesis of Npt2a transporters and insertion of these transporters into the lumen of the proximal tubule, leading to increased proximal tubule reabsorption and almost complete reabsorption of phosphate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F99797\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99797 \">figure 5</a>).

Of the plasma calcium, approximately 40 percent is bound to albumin; 15 percent is complexed with citrate, sulfate, or phosphate; and 45 percent exists as the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium. In comparison with calcium, plasma phosphorus exists in both organic and inorganic forms, including phospholipids, ester phosphates, and inorganic phosphates. Inorganic phosphates are completely ionized, circulating primarily as HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in a ratio of 4:1 at a plasma pH of 7.40. Only a small fraction of the total body calcium and phosphate is located in the plasma. However, it is the plasma concentrations of ionized calcium and inorganic phosphate that are under hormonal control.
