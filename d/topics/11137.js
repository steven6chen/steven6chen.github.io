The forearm allows the hand to interact with objects remote from the body, and enables it to pronate and supinate, capabilities that are essential for many activities of daily living, as well as technical skills such as those required for music and sports. The forearm also plays an important role in protecting the head and torso from trauma, which explains in part why fractures of the forearm are among the most common fractures.</p><p>Given the many important roles of the forearm, it is no surprise that forearm fractures can result in considerable disability, especially if treated improperly. The epidemiology, clinical anatomy, assessment, diagnosis, and management of midshaft fractures of the radius and ulna in adults will be reviewed in this topic, including Galeazzi and Monteggia fracture-dislocations. Distal forearm fractures and pediatric midshaft forearm fractures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft forearm fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal fractures of the forearm in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956357615\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although forearm fractures are relatively common, studies of the epidemiology of diaphyseal fractures of the forearm are scant. The incidence of diaphyseal fracture of the radius, ulna, or both is reported to be approximately 1 to 10 per 10,000 persons per year, although rates vary by age and sex. Studies show a bimodal distribution with the highest incidence among young males aged 10 to 20 years (10:10,000) and females over age 60 (5:10,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Diaphyseal forearm fractures occur far less frequently than distal forearm fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for diaphyseal forearm fractures include sports participation, postmenopausal status, osteoporosis, and frequent walking on icy surfaces (eg, as occurs in cold climates such as Canada or Sweden) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Football and wrestling are the highest-risk sports with 0.48 and 0.21 midshaft forearm fractures per 10,000 high-school athletic exposures, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While postmenopausal status increases the risk for both distal and midshaft forearm fractures, it increases the risk for distal fractures far more (nearly an order of magnitude in some studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>].</p><p>Galeazzi fractures (radial midshaft fractures with distal radioulnar joint [DRUJ] instability) account for 7 percent of all forearm fractures. Of all fractures involving only the radial shaft, one in four is a true Galeazzi injury. The less common Monteggia fracture dislocation (fracture of the proximal third of the ulnar shaft with dislocation of the radial head) comprises 1 to 2 percent of all forearm fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although statistics vary widely, midshaft forearm fractures commonly occur in association with one or more concomitant injuries, particularly if high energy trauma is involved. The wide range of statistics concerning associated injuries is likely due to the patient populations studied and other institution-specific factors, as well as variation in the definition of associated injury. Studies report 33 to 82 percent of midshaft radius and ulna fracture cases are isolated injuries, while up to 50 percent involve multisystem trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Concomitant fractures of the lower extremity (eg, tibial plateau, fibula, patella, femur) or ipsi- or contralateral upper extremity (eg, humeral shaft, proximal humerus, glenoid) occur in approximately 16 to 26 percent of diaphyseal forearm fracture cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The most frequently associated non-musculoskeletal injuries are reported to be closed-head and peripheral nerve injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956357621\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the forearm is complex, and only important considerations relevant to diaphyseal forearm fractures are presented here.</p><p>The radius and ulna are joined by three major groups of ligamentous structures: the triangular fibrocartilage complex including the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80101 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 2</a>), the interosseous membrane, and the annular ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97474 \">figure 3</a>), with the adjacent proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99715\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99715 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 5</a>). These structures maintain bony alignment and stability while allowing pronosupination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The proximal ulna consists of the olecranon and coronoid, which form the trochlear notch that articulates with the humerus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 5</a>). The ulnar diaphysis has minimal curvature and lies in a subcutaneous position on the posteromedial forearm. The ulnar head serves as an insertion point for the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80101 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 2</a>). The radius is notable for its round head, which articulates with the humeral capitellum and rotates within the annular ligament during pronosupination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 5</a>). The radial shaft has a bowed architecture that allows it to rotate around the ulnar shaft; loss of this bowed shape results in decreased range of motion with pronation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The distal radius broadens to a large metaphysis, creating a stable articulating surface for the scaphoid and lunate. The radius has a nutrient artery foramen on its volar surface approximately 9 cm distal to the radial head that can sometimes be mistaken for a fracture line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most muscles of the forearm can be classified into two groups: flexors of the wrist and fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99697\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99697 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99698 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99699 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99681\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99681 \">figure 9</a>), and extensors of the wrist and fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99703 \">figure 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99704 \">figure 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99696\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99696 \">figure 12</a>). The flexors lie on the anterior forearm, while the extensors lie on the posterior forearm. All anterior forearm muscles are innervated by the median nerve or its branch, the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99716 \">figure 13</a>), with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus, both of which receive innervation via the ulnar nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99702 \">figure 14</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99717 \">figure 15</a>). All posterior forearm muscles are innervated by the radial nerve or its branch, the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99718 \">figure 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97471 \">figure 17</a>). Several additional forearm muscles include an elbow flexor (brachioradialis), an elbow extensor (anconeus), pronators (pronator teres, pronator quadratus), the supinator, and a thumb abductor (abductor pollicis longus).</p><p>The blood supply to the forearm arises mainly from the brachial artery, which crosses from the medial upper arm into the antecubital fossa, where it divides into multiple branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99701\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99701 \">figure 18</a>). The ulnar and radial arteries are the principal branches, and both travel through the anterior forearm. The anterior and posterior interosseous arteries arise from the brachial artery via the common interosseous artery in the antecubital fossa. They travel adjacent to their corresponding nerve along the anterior and posterior aspects of the interosseous membrane. Displaced fractures of the radial or ulnar diaphysis can injure these deep neurovascular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956357645\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bimodal distribution of midshaft forearm fractures reflects the two primary mechanisms of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. High-energy trauma (eg, motor vehicle collisions, sports injuries, falls from a height) accounts for the large number of forearm fractures among young males with good bone stock. Low-energy trauma, primarily falls from standing, accounts for the large number of fractures among postmenopausal females, attributable to their decreased bone mineral density.</p><p>Specific fracture patterns often result from particular mechanisms. Both-bone forearm fractures require high energy, most often involving a motor vehicle collision. The injury may be sustained from a direct blow or an indirect injury involving a bending or rotational force placed on the forearm. &quot;Nightstick fractures&quot; (isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100230\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100230 \">image 1</a>)) almost always result from a direct blow to the forearm, often while the victim was using the forearm to protect their head or torso from a blow. Galeazzi's fracture-dislocation (solitary fracture near the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the radius associated with subluxation or dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint [DRUJ] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101302 \">image 2</a>)) usually results from a fall onto an extended wrist with a hyperpronated forearm. A fall onto an upper extremity with an extended elbow and a hyperpronated forearm is the most common cause of Monteggia fracture-dislocations (proximal ulnar shaft fracture with radial head dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100232\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100232 \">image 3</a>), usually anterior) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956357651\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with a midshaft forearm fracture typically complains of pain, and possibly deformity, at the site immediately following trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The mechanism involves either low energy (eg, ground-level fall, especially in older adults) or relatively high energy (eg, motor vehicle accident, collision during sporting event). It is often difficult for the patient to recall details about the mechanism, but skilled history-taking via the patient or perhaps a witness may reveal important details that could assist the clinician. As an example, a fall onto an extended wrist and pronated forearm makes a Galeazzi-type fracture more likely, and the clinician must pay particular attention to ruling out instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) in such cases. The mechanisms of injury associated with particular midshaft forearm fractures are described above. (See <a href=\"#H956357645\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p>Soft tissue trauma in the affected extremity is common, but varies widely in severity depending upon the mechanism and patient. Such injuries may include skin lacerations, superficial and deep muscle contusions, and contusions or lacerations of tendons or neurovascular structures. Crush injuries and gunshot wounds are associated with extensive soft tissue injury, frequently including neurovascular disruption, and are often significantly contaminated. Any patient with suspected or apparent concomitant injuries of the head, spine, torso, or lower extremities following trauma should be thoroughly assessed. Severe injuries associated with forearm fractures are seen most often following motor vehicle collisions and may include closed-head injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, and concomitant fractures of the upper and lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical examination begins with visual inspection, which may reveal swelling and an obvious deformity, suggesting a displaced fracture, or a wound overlying the fracture site (ie, open fracture) requiring immediate surgical evaluation. Palpation reveals focal tenderness at the fracture site and possibly deformity. Palpation should be performed gently. If possible, the wrist and elbow joints should be evaluated looking for any concomitant fracture, dislocation, or other signs of injury, followed by examination of the shoulder and other extremities. Range of motion may be limited due to pain, and testing should be performed gently, judiciously, and only if there are no obvious signs of displaced fracture or dislocation. Maneuvers to elicit crepitus may cause further soft tissue damage and should be avoided. Probing open fractures should be avoided to prevent further contaminating the wound. Severe pain and a tense muscle compartment at the fracture site raise suspicion for an acute compartment syndrome, which is a surgical emergency and must be investigated promptly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serial neurovascular examinations are essential in the patient with a midshaft ulna or radius fracture given the possibility of nerve and vascular injury from direct (laceration, crush injury) or indirect (acute compartment syndrome) mechanisms. The clinician should inquire about radiating pain, paresthesias, numbness, or weakness in the affected limb. Though not common, acute nerve injury most often involves the radial and median nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]; associated ulnar nerve injury is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Numbness and tingling along the palmar aspect of the radial side of the hand, including the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, suggest injury to the median nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99716 \">figure 13</a>), while similar symptoms along the posterior forearm and dorsal aspect of the radial side of the hand suggest radial nerve injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99718 \">figure 16</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More discrete motor deficits may indicate injury to the anterior or posterior interosseous nerves. The anterior interosseous nerve, a deep motor branch of the median nerve, supplies the flexor pollicis longus, lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus, and pronator quadratus; the posterior interosseous nerve, a deep motor branch of the radial nerve, supplies most wrist and finger extensors including the extensor digitorum, extensor indicis and extensor carpi ulnaris. These nerves are at particular risk of injury whenever the interosseous membrane is disrupted (eg, with combined radius and ulna fractures and many Monteggia fractures).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66064044\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF MIDSHAFT FOREARM FRACTURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66064050\"><span class=\"h2\">Questions for characterizing fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential questions to ask when assessing a midshaft forearm fracture include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the fracture open or closed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What bones are fractured?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where is the fracture (proximal, middle, or distal third)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the fracture pattern (eg, simple transverse, simple oblique, wedge, comminuted)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there instability at the distal or proximal radioulnar joint?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is a previous implant present?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is a previous deformity present?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the bone stock normal?</p><p/><p>A systematic approach to describing a fracture helps convey important information to a consultant in a concise manner.

The Galeazzi and Monteggia fractures have their own description schemes, which are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66064082\"><span class=\"h2\">Galeazzi fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Galeazzi fracture is defined as a radial midshaft fracture associated with instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100370\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100370 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101302 \">image 2</a>). Studies of Galeazzi fracture outcomes suggest that an important demarcation for these injuries lies 7.5 cm from the distal radial articular surface. Fractures distal to this point (ie, closer to the wrist) are labeled Type I and are more commonly associated with significant DRUJ instability. Fractures proximal to this point (ie, further from the wrist) are labeled Type II. Galeazzi type I fractures often require more extensive surgical reconstruction of the DRUJ. Another more basic distinction for Galeazzi fractures is simple (reduction of the radius restores alignment of the DRUJ) versus complex (DRUJ cannot be realigned even with reduction of the radial shaft fracture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66064102\"><span class=\"h2\">Monteggia fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Monteggia fracture is defined as a fracture of the proximal third of the ulnar shaft associated with dislocation of the radial head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100232\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100232 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72470\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72470 \">image 5</a>). A Type I Monteggia injury is the most common type in children and fits the classic description of an apex-anterior ulnar shaft fracture near the junction of the proximal and middle thirds, with an associated anterior radial head dislocation. Type-I-equivalent injuries are seen when the same injury pattern occurs except the radial head is fractured rather than dislocated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children#H18956541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal fractures of the forearm in children&quot;, section on 'Monteggia fractures'</a>.)</p><p>A Type II fracture is similar to a Type I, except both the ulnar shaft fracture apex and the radial head dislocation are directed posteriorly. Type II fractures account for approximately 80 percent of all Monteggia fractures in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. Occasionally, the elbow dislocates posteriorly, creating a Type-II-equivalent injury.</p><p>Type III fractures consist of an ulnar metaphysis fracture with lateral radial head dislocation. Fractures of the radial and ulnar shafts in association with an anterior radial head dislocation are classified as Type IV Monteggia fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956357657\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of suspected midshaft forearm fracture, anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs showing the entire length of the radius and ulna are usually diagnostic. Because the radius and ulna overlap on the lateral view, additional oblique views may improve assessment of the fracture. Dedicated views of the wrist and elbow are usually obtained to rule out concomitant injuries to these joints. Radiographs should be evaluated for adequacy, and the fractures themselves for displacement, shortening (especially in cases of both-bone fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100229\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100229 \">image 6</a>)), angulation, loss of radial bow, orientation of the fracture apex, and comminution.</p><p>Several important injuries are easily missed when assessing forearm radiographs, and special attention should be paid to the following areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The integrity of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) should be carefully examined, especially in cases of a radial shaft fracture to determine whether a Galeazzi fracture-dislocation exists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100370\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100370 \">image 4</a>). Signs of a disrupted DRUJ include ulnar styloid fracture, widening of the DRUJ on the PA view, dorsal displacement of the ulna on the lateral view, and radial shortening of &ge;5 mm compared with the unaffected limb (resulting in ulnar positive variance, the distance between straight lines drawn through the distal articular surfaces of the radius and ulna (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73876 \">image 7</a>)). Signs of DRUJ injury may not appear until days to weeks after the fracture, as the forearm musculature exerts deforming forces, even after the forearm has been placed in a cast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of concomitant radial head dislocation should be assessed, particularly in cases of ulnar shaft fracture (Monteggia fracture-dislocation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100232\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100232 \">image 3</a>).

Many midshaft forearm fractures are unstable; in other words, even when placed in a cast, they are prone to displacement due to the rotational and linear pull of the many muscles that insert on the forearm. These fractures require surgical fixation to avoid poor alignment and possibly nonunion. Even minor deformity of the radius or ulna can cause significant loss of pronosupination and disability. In addition, given the high-energy trauma involved in many forearm fractures, significant soft tissue injury is common and alone often warrants orthopedic consultation.

The functional brace, which is generally custom-made to fit the patient, allows full flexion and extension at the elbow and wrist and full pronation and supination of the forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101316\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101316 \">picture 1</a>).

The cast must cover from the distal palmar crease to the deltoid tuberosity to prevent forearm supination and pronation. A loop of wire or plastic should be incorporated into the radial (medial) aspect of the forearm portion of the cast just distal to the fracture site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101323 \">picture 3</a>). A strap is placed through this loop and used to suspend the cast from the patient's neck. This technique allows greater control of the ulna and may prevent late angulation.</p><p>In-cast radiographs are reevaluated weekly for the first month to monitor for displacement and angulation. The development of any displacement or angulation requires surgical referral. A standard long-arm cast replaces the bivalved cast at two weeks, and is again replaced with a new long-arm cast at four weeks to maintain a snug fit for effective immobilization (casts often become loose as soft-tissue swelling resolves and muscle atrophy develops). After one month, radiographs are obtained every two weeks and the cast replaced every four weeks until healing is complete (generally requires 12 to 16 weeks). Active range of motion of the fingers and shoulder is encouraged, and physical therapy is necessary once the cast is removed to regain function of the elbow and forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956357736\"><span class=\"h3\">Operative treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both-bone fractures with any angulation or displacement should be placed in a well-molded double-sugar-tong splint while awaiting surgical consultation with an orthopedist experienced in upper extremity surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This treatment course is also indicated for patients with <strong>non</strong>displaced both-bone fractures who elect surgical treatment instead of the prolonged course of casting and immobilization.</p><p>Operative treatment of these complex fractures commonly requires repair of damaged soft tissue, possibly including severed tendons and neurovascular structures.

Fewer than 10 percent of patients require hardware removal after ORIF, usually due to persistent pain. Re-fracture rates are approximately 18 percent after such hardware removal. Therefore, many experts suggest that hardware removal be delayed 12 to 18 months if possible, and that the extremity be splinted for an additional four to six weeks after removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other potential complications such as infection may follow hardware removal.</p><p>Myositis ossificans (heterotopic ossification of adjacent soft tissue) may be related to the injury or the additional trauma of surgery, or both, and is especially problematic when it causes synostosis of the proximal or distal radial-ulnar joint.</p><p>Joint stiffness can be a major complication, especially if treatment involved prolonged immobilization of the elbow or wrist, and may require extensive physical therapy.

The major goals of rehabilitation are to help the patient regain pain-free function, full range of motion, and full strength in the injured extremity. Fine neuromotor control is generally regained with little difficulty.</p><p>Decisions concerning return to work or sport are based in part on the severity of injury and the presence of any complications. As rehabilitation can begin immediately following surgical fixation, athletes and heavy laborers often choose surgical fixation since it will speed their return to play and work. The sport and work demands of the patient must be considered in both the design of the rehabilitation program and the criteria for returning to activity. Return to work or sport requiring heavy or repetitive upper extremity loading typically requires 12 to 16 weeks of healing and rehabilitation. Return to work that places few demands on the upper extremity typically requires 8 to 12 weeks. As with any fracture, the time needed for recovery can vary widely depending on the injury, activity demands, and individual rates of healing.</p><p>As rehabilitation progresses, it is reasonable to resume gradually former activity levels, beginning with light duty at work or noncontact sports practices (mainly conditioning) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Before being permitted to begin full participation at work or sport, the patient must demonstrate sufficient strength and dexterity to complete all required physical tasks.

Therefore, the injured extremity must be carefully inspected and mobility of the wrist and elbow assessed, as pain allows. (See <a href=\"#H956357651\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial neurovascular examinations are essential in the patient given the possibility of nerve and vascular injury from direct (laceration, crush injury) or indirect (acute compartment syndrome) mechanisms. The clinician should inquire about radiating pain, paresthesias, numbness, or weakness in the affected limb. Though not common, acute nerve injury most often involves the radial and median nerves; associated ulnar nerve injury is rare. Numbness and tingling along the palmar aspect of the radial side of the hand, including the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, suggest injury to the median nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99716 \">figure 13</a>), while similar symptoms along the posterior forearm and volar aspect of the radial side of the hand suggest radial nerve injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99718 \">figure 16</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases of suspected midshaft forearm fracture, anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs showing the entire length of the radius and ulna are usually diagnostic. Because the radius and ulna overlap on the lateral view, additional oblique views may improve assessment of the fracture. Dedicated views of the wrist and elbow are usually obtained to rule out concomitant injuries to these joints. Radiographs should be evaluated for adequacy, and the fractures themselves for displacement, shortening (especially in cases of both-bone fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100229\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100229 \">image 6</a>)), angulation, loss of radial bow, orientation of the fracture apex, and comminution. In addition, the radiographs should be reviewed carefully for the following injuries (see <a href=\"#H956357657\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>DRUJ injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radial head dislocation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proximal radial shaft fracture with rotational displacement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate orthopedic consultation is required for open fractures or signs of arterial compromise. Neurologic symptoms or deficits on examination in the absence of vascular compromise do not require emergent intervention but warrant urgent orthopedic evaluation, typically on the same day. Many midshaft fractures of the forearm are unstable and the large majority require orthopedic consultation. Uncomplicated &quot;nightstick&quot; fractures of the ulna (with little to no displacement or angulation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100230\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100230 \">image 1</a>) that meet the following criteria may be managed nonoperatively (see <a href=\"#H956357663\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Greater than 50 percent apposition (ie, overlap of fracture fragments)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less than 10 degrees angulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No radial head dislocation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fracture located within distal two-thirds of the ulna</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard initial treatment, consisting of rest, ice, elevation, immobilization, and appropriate analgesia, is provided to all patients with a midshaft forearm fracture. The method of immobilization for each type of fracture is described in the text. Definitive care is generally provided by the orthopedic surgeon to whom the patient is referred. (See <a href=\"#H956357669\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential for complications with midshaft forearm fractures sustained from high-energy trauma is relatively high. With all midshaft forearm fractures, poor anatomic alignment (especially loss of radial bow) with secondary lost range of motion is a significant concern. Minimizing this risk is a major reason for surgical treatment. Additional important potential complications include the following (see <a href=\"#H956357748\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nerve injuries, including acute laceration or entrapment and chronic entrapment during fracture healing; radial and median nerves most commonly affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wound infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute compartment syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myositis ossificans (heterotopic ossification)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malunion and nonunion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radioulnar synostosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptomatic surgical hardware requiring removal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return to work or sport requiring heavy or repetitive upper extremity loading typically requires 12 to 16 weeks of healing and rehabilitation. Return to work that places few demands on the upper extremity typically requires 8 to 12 weeks. As with any fracture, the time needed for recovery can vary widely depending on the injury, activity demands, and individual rates of healing. (See <a href=\"#H956357754\" class=\"local\">'Return to sport or work'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-ulna-and-radius-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">J&oacute;nsson B, Bengn&eacute;r U, Redlund-Johnell I, Johnell O.
