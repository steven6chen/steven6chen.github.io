In almost every case, the shoulder has been injured months or years earlier, leading to an abnormal wearing down of the cartilage. Injuries include bony fracture, dislocation, or heavy blow to the outer shoulder.</p><p>Fortunately, arthritis of the shoulder progresses slowly. Treatment focuses on reduction of inflammation, physical therapy stretching exercises to preserve motion, shoulder muscle strengthening exercises, and avoidance of activities to prevent further wear and arthritic flare-ups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOULDER ARTHRITIS TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Limit activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoiding painful activities in general will alleviate strain on the injured area. Restrict lifting, overhead reaching, and reaching behind (eg, reaching into the backseat) as much as possible during the early recovery period. It is safest to keep the arm down and in front of and close to the body.</p><p>Some general rules to decrease shoulder strain with activities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If only one of your shoulders is affected, put that arm in your shirt or coat first when getting dressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lift objects close to the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only lift light weights, and limit lifting to below shoulder level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do sidestroke or breaststroke when swimming (avoid the backstroke and classic crawl stroke).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw balls underhand or sidearm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid pushing exercises at the gym (eg, pushups, bench press, flies, shoulder press).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not serve overhand in tennis or volleyball.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain good posture with writing, assembly work, and other tasks by keeping the shoulder blades down and back.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If needed, a nonprescription pain medication, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (eg, Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (eg, Aleve), can be taken (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). No more than 3000 mg of acetaminophen are recommended per day. Anyone who has liver disease or who drinks alcohol regularly should speak with his or her healthcare provider before taking acetaminophen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOULDER ARTHRITIS STRETCHING EXERCISES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heat helps prepare the tissues for stretching and should be performed prior to exercise sessions. The preferable method of heating is whole-body, deep heating in a warm shower or bath for 10 to 15 minutes. Local heat (for example, with a moist heating pad or a towel warmed in a microwave) is an alternative, but generally is not as effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Weighted pendulum stretching exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These exercises are intended to help maintain joint mobility and flexibility of the muscles and tendons in the shoulder. Range of motion and flexibility exercises should not cause more than a mild level of pain; patients who feel sharp or tearing pain while stretching should stop exercising immediately and should consult their healthcare provider.</p><p>This exercise should be performed once or twice per day, after the shoulder is warmed with cardiovascular exercise; or a directly applied warm pack.</p><p>The exercise is performed as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50148\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50148 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relax your shoulder muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While standing or sitting, keep your arm vertical and close to your body (bending over too far may pinch the rotator cuff tendons).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allow your arm to swing forward to back, then side to side, and then in small circles in each direction (no greater than one foot in any direction). Only minimal pain should be felt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretch the arm only (without added weight) for three to seven days. Progress this exercise by adding 1 to 2 lbs (0.5 to 1 kg) per week and by gradually increasing the diameter of the movements (not to exceed 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a few weeks, this exercise should be supplemented or replaced by other exercises to target specific areas of tightness or restriction. The pendulum stretch may be recommended as a warm-up for more localized flexibility exercises <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> strengthening exercises.</p><p/><p>When performed correctly, the pendulum exercise should not result in more than mild discomfort. If more pain is felt, consult a healthcare provider for instructions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Passive stretching exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive stretches are performed after the pendulum stretch exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51493%7EPI%2F78109%7EPI%2F77955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51493 graphicRef78109 graphicRef77955 \">picture 1A-C</a>). These exercises, performed once or twice a day for several months, should further loosen the tightened shoulder lining and should help to restore more normal range of motion. Sets of 10 to 20 of the following three exercises are performed daily:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Armpit stretch &ndash; Use your good arm to lift the affected arm onto a shelf, dresser, or any object about breast high. Gently bend at the knees, opening up the arm pit. Try to push the arm up a little farther with each stretch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finger walk &ndash; Face a wall about three-quarters of an arm&rsquo;s length away. Using only your fingers (not your shoulder muscles) raise your arm up to shoulder level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Towel stretch &ndash; Take a three-foot-long towel, grasp it with both hands, and hold it at a 45-degree angle. Use the upper, good arm to pull the arm toward the lower back. This can be repeated with the towel in the horizontal position.</p><p/><p>The goal of these exercises is to stretch the shoulder to the point of tension but not pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOULDER-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle-toning exercises should be performed after your initial pain has resolved. These exercises are necessary to restore any lost muscle strength.</p><p>The joint should always be heated and stretched (as outlined above) prior to beginning toning exercises. Following a two- or three-minute rest, perform sets of 15 to 20 exercises daily, each held for five seconds. Flexible rubber tubing, bungee cords, or large rubber bands are used for each exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70846 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Outward rotation exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hold your elbows at 90 degrees, close to your sides. Grasp the rubber band with your hands, and rotate your forearms outward only two or three inches, holding for five seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53514 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inward rotation exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hold your elbow at 90 degrees, close to your side. Hook the rubber band onto a door handle, and grasp with only one hand. Rotate your forearm inward two or three inches, and hold for five seconds. The forearm swings like a door (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67577\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67577 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifting exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bend your elbow to 90 degrees. Place the rubber band near the elbows, and lift your arms up four or five inches away from the body, holding for five seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55598\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55598 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Mild soreness should be expected with these exercises. Sharp or severe pain may indicate a flare of the underlying problem; stop these exercises for a few days if this occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=714\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
