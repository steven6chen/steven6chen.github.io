In the United States, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which included results from self-collected vaginal swabs from over 3700 women, estimated the prevalence of BV was 29 percent in the general population of women aged 14 to 49 years and 50 percent in African-American women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This included both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Worldwide, BV is common among women of reproductive age, with variations according to the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The health consequences of BV infection are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H1871873895\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered vaginal flora and dysbiosis</strong> &ndash; BV represents a complex change in the vaginal flora characterized by a reduction in concentration of the normally dominant hydrogen-peroxide producing lactobacilli and an increase in concentration of other organisms, especially anaerobic gram negative rods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Ethnicity and age are additional factors that appear to impact the vaginal microbial community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The absence of inflammation is the basis for the term &quot;vaginosis&quot; rather than &quot;vaginitis.&quot; Some authors use the term &quot;dysbiosis&quot; to reflect the microbial imbalance in the vaginal flora that can ultimately impact vaginal function and lead to negative health consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1871873895\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The major bacteria detected in women with BV are <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>, <em>Prevotella</em> species, <em>Porphyromonas</em> species, <em>Bacteroides</em> species, <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> species, <em>Mycoplasma hominis</em>, and <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>, as well as <em>Mobiluncus</em>, <em>Megasphaera</em>, <em>Sneathia</em>, and <em>Clostridiales</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>]. <em>Fusobacterium</em> species and <em>Atopobium vaginae</em> are also common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The difference in vaginal flora between women with and without BV was illustrated in a study that used broad range DNA probes to determine the vaginal flora of 27 women with BV and 46 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall, 35 bacterial phylotypes were identified in women with BV, including 16 which were newly recognized. Women with BV had a mean of 12.6 phylotypes (range 9 to 17) per sample compared to 3.3 phylotypes (range 1 to 6) per sample in women without BV. The organisms newly identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) include fastidious bacteria termed &quot;BV associated bacterium (BVAB) 1, 2 and 3&quot; in the Clostridiales order, which appear to be specific indicators of BV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Subsequent studies have documented several other bacterial species in the human vagina, including the novel strains Peptoniphilaceae DNF01163 and Prevotellaceae DNF00733 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Production of amines</strong> &ndash; Hydrogen-peroxide producing lactobacilli appear to be important in preventing overgrowth of the anaerobes normally present in the vaginal flora. With the loss of lactobacilli, pH rises and massive overgrowth of vaginal anaerobes occurs. These anaerobes produce large amounts of proteolytic carboxylase enzymes, which break down vaginal peptides into a variety of amines that are volatile, malodorous, and associated with increased vaginal transudation and squamous epithelial cell exfoliation, resulting in the typical clinical features observed in patients with BV (see <a href=\"#H1208987568\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below). The rise in pH also facilitates adherence of <em>G. vaginalis</em> to the exfoliating epithelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Role of biofilm</strong> &ndash; Increasing evidence suggests that <em>G. vaginalis</em> is the key player in the pathogenesis of BV and the development of a biofilm may be an essential component of this process, in addition to the gradual overgrowth of resident anaerobic vaginal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. In this model, a cohesive form of <em>G. vaginalis</em> adheres to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by a study of microbiota on the epithelial surfaces of vaginal biopsy specimens from women with BV that showed a biofilm adhered to part or all of the epithelium, and <em>G. vaginalis</em> comprised 90 percent of bacteria in the biofilm, while <em>Atopobium vaginae</em> accounted for most of the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Subsequent desquamation of these epithelial cells would result in the classic clue cells diagnostic of the disorder (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). In contrast, most healthy controls had unstructured accumulations of bacteria within secretions loosely attached to epithelial surfaces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a factor in the structural stability of biofilms in a variety of bacterial species and appears to play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the <em>G. vaginalis</em> biofilm in BV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The presence of a biofilm may make it difficult to eradicate BV and increase the rate of recurrence, but discovery of the role of eDNA has led to the hypothesis that a DNase might be able to destroy the eDNA that helps to maintain the BV biofilm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexual activity</strong> &ndash; While the majority of data support the hypothesis that BV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not yet classified as such because of lack of a single causative agent and absence of a clear disease counterpart in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29-33</a>]. In addition, early studies reported mixed results on the impact of treatment of the male sexual partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>]. However, a subsequent review of early negative or inconclusive studies reported that these studies lacked sufficient power to detect reasonable effect sizes, had deficient or inadequately reported randomization methods, and lacked information on adherence to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sexual activity is a risk factor for BV and most experts believe that BV does not occur in women who have never had sexual contact of any type, including receptive oral sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Epidemiologic studies are strongly supportive of sexual transmission of BV pathogens. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 43 observational studies, sexual contact with new and multiple male and female partners was associated with an increased risk of BV, while condom use was associated with a decreased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, many BV-associated species have been isolated from the male penile skin, semen, urethra, and urine specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BV is highly prevalent (25 to 50 percent) in women who have sex with women (WSW), and is associated with increasing numbers of female sexual partners, a female partner with symptomatic BV, and various sexual practices, suggesting sexual transmission is an important factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-50</a>]. However, in one study, sexually active monogamous WSW partnerships over six months tended to have concordant, stable, vaginal microbiota, which was most concordant for normal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This suggests that longer duration, sexually active partnerships led to stability and alignment of a favorable vaginal microbiota in WSW couples. Accordingly, the majority of investigators believe that BV, as an original or first infection or occurrence, is sexually transmitted. However, in contrast to trichomoniasis, chlamydial, or gonococcal infection, there is also a high rate of symptomatic recurrence of BV in the absence of sexual activity or reinfection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong> &ndash; The presence of other sexually transmitted infections appears to be associated with an increased prevalence of BV. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the association between BV infection and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 infection, women infected with HSV-2 had a 55 percent higher risk of BV infection compared with women who were HSV-2 uninfected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Similarly, a five-year prospective cohort study reported that BV was both more prevalent and more persistent among HIV-infected women compared with those without HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Conversely, BV may also be a risk factor for HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-and-women#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV and women&quot;, section on 'Bacterial vaginosis, genital ulcers, and pelvic inflammatory disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Race and ethnicity</strong> &ndash; While higher rates of BV have been reported in minority populations, it is not clear if this finding reflects genetic, socioeconomic, behavioral, or other differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,12,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,54</a>]. In the United States NHANES 2001 to 2004 study, the rates of BV based on self-collected swabs were 51 percent for African-American women, 32 percent for Mexican-American women, and 23 percent for women of European ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast, in a small study comparing the vaginal microbiota of white and black women by both cultivation-dependent and &ndash;independent methods, there were no differences in colonization and density of bacterial species by race once women with BV by Nugent criteria were removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; In addition to sexual and infectious risk factors, most studies indicate douching and cigarette smoking are risk factors for acquisition of BV among sexually active women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3,47,56-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,47,56-61</a>]. Although some degree of genetic susceptibility to BV is likely, no association between a gene polymorphism and BV has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. One questionnaire study reported an association between high fat diets and BV as well as an inverse relationship for BV with the intakes of folate, vitamin E, and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. While these dietary factors were associated with BV, further studies are needed to determine causality. Of note, BV is not associated with chronic medical conditions (eg, diabetes) or immunosuppressive states.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1208987568\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fifty to 75 percent of women with BV are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,64,65</a>]. Symptomatic women typically present with vaginal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal odor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,64,65</a>]. The discharge is off-white, thin, and homogeneous; the odor is an unpleasant &quot;fishy smell&quot; that may be more noticeable after sexual intercourse and during menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>BV alone typically does not cause dysuria, dyspareunia, pruritus, burning, or vaginal inflammation (erythema, edema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. The presence of these symptoms suggests mixed vaginitis (symptoms due to two pathogens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Although BV does not involve the cervix, the disorder may be associated with acute cervicitis (endocervical mucopurulent discharge or easily induced cervical bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Although BV is more common among women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), it is not clear whether it is a causal factor or an independent risk factor for this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It has been hypothesized that the increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections in women with BV may be due to lack of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vaginal flora of affected women; other factors associated with BV infection, such as local cytokine production, may also play a role.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BV may be a factor in development of precancerous cervical lesions. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of primarily cross-sectional studies, the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) was increased in women with BV (odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.83); however, there was considerable heterogeneity among these studies and both CIN 1 and low-grade SIL, which do not usually progress to cancer, were included as outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. BV appears conducive to the persistence of human papillomavirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>], which is necessary but not sufficient for development of high-grade cervical lesions and cancer.

Use of Nugent or <span class=\"nowrap\">Hay/Ison</span> criteria to evaluate a Gram-stained smear of vaginal discharge is the diagnostic standard in research studies, but requires more time, resources, and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. If microscopy is not available, the diagnosis should be based on findings on clinical examination (characteristic vaginal discharge, elevated vaginal pH, fishy odor). Commercial tests that have acceptable performance compared with gram stain include a DNA probe-based test for high concentrations of <em>G. vaginalis </em>(Affirm VP III) and vaginal fluid sialidase activity test (OSOM BV Blue test). A triple PCR assay for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas has been developed and initial testing reported sensitivity and specificity of 91.5 and 98.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

BV is the most common cause of vaginitis in women of childbearing age. (See <a href=\"#H1208690745\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2912885021\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BV represents a complex change in the vaginal flora characterized by a reduction in concentration of the normally dominant hydrogen-peroxide producing lactobacilli and an increase in concentration of other organisms, particularly anaerobic and highly specific fastidious BV-associated bacteria. Vaginal wall biofilms, comprised predominantly of <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>, appear to play a role in pathogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 to 75 percent of women with BV are asymptomatic. Those with symptoms often present with an off-white, thin, and homogeneous &quot;fishy smelling&quot; discharge that is more noticeable after coitus and during menses. (See <a href=\"#H1208987568\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequelae of BV can include an increased risk of preterm birth, plasma-cell endometritis, postpartum fever, post-hysterectomy vaginal cuff cellulitis, postabortal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections. (See <a href=\"#H1871873895\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When microscopy is available, the diagnosis of BV is based on the presence of at least three of the following four Amsel criteria (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vaginal pH greater than 4.5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive whiff-amine test, defined as the presence of a fishy odor when 10 percent potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added to a sample of vaginal discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clue cells on saline wet mount, comprising at least 20 percent of epithelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52425 \">picture 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73248 \">picture 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If microscopy is not available, we suggest using physical examination, pH testing, whiff-amine test, and a commercial test using a DNA probe (eg, Affirm VP III) to make the diagnosis of BV.
