The significant illness, prolonged waiting times, and confusion often found in busy emergency departments (ED) creates a stressful atmosphere that can exacerbate feelings of agitation among patients and their families. The ED's 24-hour open door policy, availability of potential hostages, and widespread accessibility of drugs and weapons compound the problem.</p><p>The evaluation and management of the acutely agitated or violent patient will be reviewed here. The management of specific psychiatric ailments and intoxicated or poisoned patients is discussed elsewhere.

Surveys of emergency care workers and nurses in Turkey and Australia report similar rates of violence as those in United States studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A 1997 survey of psychiatry residents revealed that 73 percent reported being threatened, and 36 percent had been physically assaulted in residency. Two-thirds of them had received either no or inadequate training in managing combative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Approximately 4 to 8 percent of patients who present to psychiatric EDs are armed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. At one large urban county hospital ED in the United States, an average of 5.4 weapons was confiscated each day using metal detector screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At this center, 26.7 percent of major trauma patients seen in the ED over a 14-year period were armed with lethal weapons (84 percent knives and 16 percent guns). The presence of weapons among many ED patients increases the potential for rapid escalation of violence. Unfortunately, predicting weapons carriage in any particular patient is not easy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of violent behavior is not well understood. A wide range of factors may play a role, including the environment, a patient's social and medical history, interpersonal relations, genetics, neurochemistry and endocrine function, and substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>It is important to assess for potentially dangerous organic causes of agitation as soon as this can be done safely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82146 \">table 1</a>). In the emergency department (ED), drug and alcohol intoxication or withdrawal are the most common diagnoses in combative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A rapid serum glucose measurement (eg, fingerstick glucose), pulse oximetry, and a complete set of vital signs should be obtained in all patients.

A telephone survey of 250 United States hospitals with emergency departments (EDs) revealed that approximately 23 percent of hospitals have a 24-hour security presence, 14 percent have security present part of the day, and 63 percent do not have security formally assigned to the ED at any time during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Only 21 percent control access to the ED during high-risk hours, 39 percent use a security code, 46 percent have alarm buttons, 14 percent have a seclusion room, 36 percent use closed circuit surveillance, and 1.6 percent use metal detectors. Security measures have increased in parallel with the rising ED census [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The prevention of violence is best accomplished by developing a system that includes ongoing staff education, adequate personnel, and a well-designed physical structure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk environments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive approach is needed to reduce violence at high-risk sites. One large urban United States hospital with a high incidence of violent behavior reported no incident of weapons related violence or injury in the ED following implementation of the following measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large security force</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metal detectors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulletproof Plexiglas in triage areas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keypad security entry system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring entry into the ED</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong barriers to prevent cars from driving into the department</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General prevention measures</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Security personnel</strong> &ndash; A well-trained and responsive security force is a key element of any security system. Nevertheless, security personnel constitute a significant expense and their services are often curtailed or eliminated when hospitals face fiscal difficulties. The use of guns by hospital security personnel is controversial. Guards may be allowed to carry guns after completing extensive weapons training. Other devices, such as electric stun guns and pepper spray, represent less lethal alternatives but are not free of risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alarm systems</strong> &ndash; Alarm systems are commonly used in the ED and psychiatric wards. The goal of any alarm system is to obtain rapid assistance. False alarms must be minimized. A tiered alarm system is usually best. Panic buttons in each room activate a central buzzer in the ED. Several designated ED personnel respond initially and judge the level of response needed. Every ED should have at least one telephone with a direct line to police or security in case additional personnel are needed. A verbal code (eg, &quot;Dr. Armstrong to Room 9&quot;) to call for additional help is useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limiting access</strong> &ndash; Controlling access into the ED and hospital helps to prevent violence. This can be done by limiting the number of entrances, controlling entryways (eg, buzzer activated doors), and monitoring who enters. High-risk EDs should limit access to one or two entrances, especially during the evening hours. During nonvisiting hours, all entrances to the hospital other than the ED should be locked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Caretaker education</strong> &ndash; Regular, brief education sessions with clinicians, nurses, and ancillary staff to train them in the prevention and management of agitated and violent patients may reduce the incidence of violence and improve work satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Interview preparation and setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients must be disarmed before an interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Metal detectors can be used to identify weapons before patients are allowed entry into the emergency department (ED). The routine practice of undressing all patients and placing them in a gown serves as a nonconfrontational way to search for weapons. Searches should be performed in a nondiscriminatory manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A warning sign should be prominently displayed (eg, &quot;For the safety of patients and staff, individuals entering the ED may be screened for weapons&quot;). Almost all patients and families will cooperate with searches and may feel safer as a result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The setting of the patient interview should be private but not isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. Some EDs have seclusion rooms specifically intended for interviewing a potentially dangerous patient. Whenever a potentially aggressive or volatile patient is interviewed, security personnel should be nearby and the door left open to allow both intervention and escape by the clinician.</p><p>The patient and interviewer may be seated roughly equidistant from the door, or the interviewer may sit between the patient and the door. The patient should NOT sit between the clinician and the exit, nor should the exit be blocked. Blocking the door poses a risk of harm to the clinician if the patient feels the need to escape.</p><p>Ideally, two exits should be available and doors should swing outward. This facilitates escape but may increase the chance of injury to anyone standing outside the door. The clinician should have unrestricted access to the door and therefore should never sit behind a desk.</p><p>The interview room should not contain heavy objects that may be thrown, such as ashtrays, or other potential weapons, such as electrical cords, scalpels, needles, or hot liquids. The clinician should have a mechanism for alerting others of danger, such as a panic button or a code word or phrase that instructs others to call for security (eg, &quot;I need Dr. Armstrong in here&quot;). Glasses, earrings, neckties, and necklaces should be removed. Personal accessories that may be used to harm the clinician, such as a scissors or pocketknives, should be removed. The clinician should be aware of any objects within the room or on the patient's body, such as pens, watches, or belts, that may be used as weapons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of potentially violent patients can be difficult. Research in this area is scant and limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Male gender, a history of violence, and drug or alcohol abuse are associated with violence, but ethnicity, diagnosis, age, marital status, and education do not reliably identify such behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/20,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,32-35</a>]. Patients with a history of violent behavior are more likely to act violently again and to inflict serious injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Thus, whenever possible, it is important to learn from family, caretakers, clinicians familiar with the patient, and medical records about any past violent episodes. </p><p>Evaluation of the combative patient begins with risk assessment and attention to safety measures. Usually violence erupts after a period of mounting tension. The astute practitioner may identify verbal and nonverbal cues and seize the opportunity to defuse the situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In a typical scenario, the patient first becomes angry, then resists authority, and finally becomes confrontational. However, violent behavior may erupt without warning, especially when caused by medical illness or dementia. Clinicians should not feel overly confident in their ability to sense impending danger. As a whole, practitioners tend to be poor predictors of impending violence. Nevertheless, the clinician should pay attention to any &quot;gut feeling&quot; that a dangerous situation may be developing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. An uncomfortable or threatening feeling during an interview is ominous, and appropriate precautions should be taken without delay.</p><p>In the ED, an obviously angry patient should always be considered potentially violent. Signs of impending violence include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provocative behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angry demeanor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loud, aggressive speech</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tense posturing (eg, gripping arm rails tightly, clenching fists)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequently changing body position, pacing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive acts (eg, pounding walls, throwing objects, hitting oneself)</p><p/><p>Psychiatric texts emphasize the attitude of the patient's hands as an indicator of tension.</p><p>The patient should be removed from contact with belligerent accomplices or other provocative patients to prevent escalation. A quiet area with a window enabling direct observation is optimal. Because increased waiting times correlate with violent behavior, the evaluation of these patients should be expedited to prevent any escalation of aggression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. Often, the aura of preferential treatment will defuse patient anger. Ancillary staff often resist this concept and dogmatically insist that the patient wait. They must be educated on the importance of &quot;moving someone to the head of the line&quot; when dealing with potential violence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research into the best methods for managing acutely agitated patients is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The approaches discussed below are based on the available evidence and our experience.</p><p>Patients who are agitated but cooperative may be amenable to verbal deescalation techniques. Actively violent patients and uncooperative, agitated patients, particularly those who exhibit signs of impending violence, require immediate restraint. Patients who obviously do not understand what is occurring, for psychiatric or other reasons, or are unable to communicate and are perceived by medical staff to be potentially violent should be restrained. Assume that all violent patients are armed until proven otherwise, especially those presenting with major trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Verbal techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all patients who present with agitation or violent behavior deserve the chance to calm down in response to verbal techniques before physical restraints or sedative medications are implemented. During initial interactions with the patient using the techniques described below, it will rapidly become clear to the clinician whether the patient will cooperate. This interaction also enables the clinician to assess the patient's mental status. If the patient remains resistant or violent or is incapable of interacting appropriately then restraint is necessary.</p><p>Agitated but cooperative, nonviolent patients may be amenable to verbal deescalation techniques, although clinical evidence supporting such an approach is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The interviewer should adopt an honest and straightforward manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Friendly gestures can be helpful. Offer a soft chair or something to eat or drink (not a hot liquid, which may be used as a weapon) to establish trust. Many patients will decompress at this point, as offering food or drink appeals to their most basic human needs and builds trust.</p><p>A non-confrontational, but attentive and receptive manner without conveying weakness or vulnerability is optimal. Some patients become angry because they feel they are not being taken seriously or treated with respect and their anger abates when these concerns are addressed.</p><p>A calm and soothing tone of voice should be used. It is important to avoid direct eye contact or approaching the patient from behind or moving suddenly, and to stand at least two arm's lengths away [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,44</a>].</p><p>In some cases, an agitated patient may be aware of their impulse control problem and may welcome limit-setting behavior by the clinician (eg, &quot;I can help you with your problem, but I cannot allow you to continue threatening me or the emergency department staff&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is difficult to predict which patients will respond to this limit-setting approach. Some patients may interpret such statements as confrontational and escalate their behavior, in which case restraint becomes necessary.</p><p>A key mistake when interviewing an agitated or potentially violent patient is failing to address violence directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/33,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,43</a>]. The patient should be asked relevant questions such as: &quot;Do you feel like hurting yourself or someone else?&quot; and &quot;Do you carry a gun?&quot; Stating the obvious (eg, &quot;You look angry&quot;) may help the patient to begin sharing emotions. If the patient becomes more agitated, it is important to speak in a conciliatory manner and offer supportive statements to diffuse the situation, such as, &quot;You obviously have a lot of will power and are good at controlling yourself.&quot; An offer of medication or restraints may prevent further escalation and is often welcomed.</p><p>A consensus statement from the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry De-escalation Workgroup describes 10 key elements for verbal de-escalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect personal space &ndash; Maintain a distance of two arm's lengths and provide space for easy exit for either party.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not be provocative &ndash; Keep your hands relaxed, maintain a non-confrontational body posture, and do not stare at the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish verbal contact &ndash; The first person to contact the patient should be the leader.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use concise, simple language &ndash; Elaborate and technical terms are hard for an impaired person to understand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify feelings and desires &ndash; &quot;What are you hoping for?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listen closely to what the patient is saying &ndash; After listening, restate what the patient said to improve mutual understanding (eg, &quot;Tell me if I have this right&hellip;&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agree or agree to disagree &ndash; (a) Agree with clear specific truths; (b) agree in general: &quot;Yes everyone should be treated respectfully; (c) agree with minority situations: &quot;There are others who would feel like you.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lay down the law and set clear limits &ndash; Inform the patient that violence or abuse cannot be tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer choices and optimism &ndash; Patients feel empowered if they have some choice in matters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debrief the patient and staff.</p><p/><p>Some techniques used in business to manage upset customers can be applied to agitated patients.

Arguing, machismo, condescension, or commanding the patient to calm down can have disastrous consequences. Patients often interpret such approaches as a challenge to &quot;prove themselves.&quot; A threat to call security personnel also invites aggression.</p><p>Other potential mistakes include criticizing or interrupting the patient, responding defensively or taking the patient's ire personally, and not clarifying what the patient wants before responding.</p><p>Never lie to a patient (eg, &quot;I am sure you will be out of here in no time&quot; when this is not the case). Once the lie becomes apparent, the patient may take out frustrations violently upon an unsuspecting nurse or colleague who follows the interviewer.</p><p>Take all threats seriously. It is especially important not to deny or downplay threatening behavior. To do so places the interviewer at increased risk of assault and injury. An example of this principle involves a psychiatrist who was killed after entering the waiting room with a patient he knew was potentially violent and armed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. He erroneously believed that the strength of the clinician-patient relationship ensured his safety.</p><p>If verbal techniques are unsuccessful and escalation occurs, the clinician should excuse himself and summon help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical restraints</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">When to apply restraints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical restraints can be used when, despite a professional and proper approach to the combative patient, verbal techniques are unsuccessful. The use of restraints can be humane and effective while facilitating diagnosis and treatment of the patient and preventing injury to the patient and medical staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Restraints are never to be applied for convenience or punishment, and should be removed as soon as possible, usually once adequate chemical sedation is achieved. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Chemical sedation'</a> below.)</p><p>Indications for emergency seclusion and restraint include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imminent harm to others</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imminent harm to the patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant disruption of important treatment or damage to the environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuation of an effective, ongoing behavior treatment program</p><p/><p>The clinician may find it helpful to classify patients into three categories. First, those with an organic disorder for whom restraints facilitate evaluation. Second, those with functional psychosis for whom verbal techniques are less effective and restraints facilitate administration of neuroleptics. Third, those with personality disorders for whom verbal techniques are not useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,49</a>].</p><p>Seclusion may be used to decrease environmental stimulation and at the patient's request in some instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In other circumstances, seclusion or restraint may be contraindicated. As examples, seclusion is unsuitable for any patient who is hemodynamically unstable, suicidal, self-abusive, self-mutilating, or has overdosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/18,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">How to apply restraints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restraints should be implemented systematically, ideally using an approved institutional protocol. This protocol begins with the examiner leaving the room once verbal techniques have been unsuccessful and summoning assistance. It may be helpful to consider the application of restraints like a procedure, analogous to running an advanced cardiac life support code [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The restraint team should have at least five people, including a team leader. The leader is the only person giving orders and should be the person with the most experience implementing restraints, whether a clinician, nurse, or security officer. Before entering the room, the leader outlines the restraint protocol and warns of anticipated danger (eg, the presence of objects that may be used as weapons). All team members should remove personal effects, which the patient could use against them. If the patient to be restrained is female, at least one member of the restraint team should be female to diminish potential allegations of sexual assault.</p><p>The team enters the room in force and displays a professional, rather than threatening, attitude. Many violent individuals decompress at this point, as a show of force protects their ego (eg, &quot;I would have fought back but there were too many against me&quot;). The leader speaks to the patient in a calm and organized manner, explaining why restraints are needed and what the course of events will be (eg, &quot;You will receive a medical and psychiatric examination as well as treatment&quot;). The patient is instructed to cooperate and lie down to have restraints applied. Some patients will be relieved at the protection to self and others afforded by restraints when they feel themselves losing control. However, even if the patient suddenly appears less dangerous, physical restraints MUST be placed once the decision to use them has been made. Do NOT negotiate with the patient at this point.</p><p>Some larger hospitals use a designated violence management team that responds to all patient encounters in which restraints may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The basic approach to individual patients is similar to that described here, but all team members have expertise managing violent patients. The team may include a psychiatric nurse. This approach eliminates the difficulty of providing regular training for all hospital staff and helps to ensure a consistent, expert approach to potentially violent situations. At smaller institutions this approach may not be feasible.</p><p>If it becomes necessary to use force to control the patient, one team member restrains a preassigned extremity by controlling the major joint (knee or elbow). This can be accomplished by locking the major joint in extension. The team leader controls the head. If the patient is armed with a makeshift weapon, two mattresses can be used to charge and immobilize or sandwich the patient. Restraints are applied securely to each extremity and tied to the solid frame of the bed (not side rails, as later repositioning of side rails also repositions the patient's extremity). To prevent lower extremities from flailing independently, it may be best to cross the legs at the ankle and then attach the restraint to the bed frame at the opposite side.</p><p>Leather is the optimal material for restraints because it is strong, prevents escape, and is less constricting than typical soft restraints. Gauze should not be used. Soft restraints are helpful in restricting extremity use in a semi-cooperative patient, but are less effective in the truly violent patient who continues to struggle.</p><p>If chest restraints are used, it is vital that adequate chest expansion for ventilation is ensured. Applying a soft Philadelphia collar to the patient's neck will help to prevent head-banging and biting. Whenever possible, the treating clinician should not participate directly in applying restraints in order to preserve the clinician-patient relationship and not be viewed as adversarial. Restraining patients on their side helps to prevent aspiration, although supine positioning with the head elevated is more comfortable for the patient and allows a more thorough medical examination while providing some protection against aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Once the patient is immobilized, announcing &quot;the crisis is over&quot; will have a calming effect on the restraint team and the patient.</p><p>We recommend avoiding the prone restraint position and using aggressive chemical sedation in patients who continue to struggle against physical restraints. Sudden, unexpected deaths have been reported in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-59</a>]. Restraints applied by prehospital personnel that place patients in the prone or hobble position (ie, arms and legs restrained behind the patient) have resulted in deaths possibly due to asphyxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. While healthy volunteers do not appear to experience asphyxia when exerting themselves against restraints, the combative patient often suffers from other conditions which increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p>Restrained patients who are intoxicated with cocaine, amphetamines, or other stimulants appear to be at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Increased sympathetic tone and altered pain sensation may allow exertion beyond normal physiologic limits in these patients and may cause vasoconstriction that impedes the clearance of metabolic waste products. Altered respiratory mechanics due to a restrained posture in an acidemic patient may impair respiratory compensation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring and care of physically restrained patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After restraints have been applied successfully, the patient should be monitored frequently and have his position changed regularly to prevent neurovascular sequelae such as circulatory obstruction, pressure sores, and paresthesias, as well as to avoid rhabdomyolysis associated with continued combativeness. A standardized form is recommended for this monitoring and should be developed by every emergency department (ED) or ward that physically restrains patients. Documentation should include the specific indication for restraints and a colleague's agreement that restraints were necessary. Physical restraints should be removed as soon as possible.</p><p>In addition to monitoring and other measures to prevent medical complications, clinicians must ensure that basic needs (eg, hydration, toilet) are met for any patient who is physically restrained or chemically sedated.</p><p>The restraint team should review their performance and discuss ways to improve effectiveness. Education and rehearsal by staff is imperative to maintain skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical sedation may be necessary, with or without physical restraints, in a patient that does not respond to verbal deescalation techniques. Rapid tranquilization may be required in the agitated or violent patient. Anticipating the need for pharmacologic management early in the clinical course of a patient likely to become agitated may obviate the need for physical restraint.</p><p>The ideal sedative medication for the agitated or violent patient would be rapidly acting, effective regardless of the route of administration, and possess minimal side effects. Few double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been performed to establish the efficacy or safety of any single medication in the management of acute delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. With all medications, the degree of sedation required must be balanced against potential side effects.</p><p>The three major classes of medication generally used to control the violent or agitated patient include benzodiazepines, first generation (typical) antipsychotics, and second generation (atypical) antipsychotics. Each class is discussed in detail below.</p><p>Clinicians may need to consider the potential difficulty and time required to place an intravenous catheter when determining their approach to chemical sedation. Clinical studies reporting the time required to achieve sedation often fail to account for the time needed to complete this procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-based approach to drug selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A treatment algorithm outlining our approach to chemical sedation of the acutely agitated patient, including specific medication suggestions, is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61852 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>In summary we suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severely violent patients requiring immediate sedation, give a rapidly acting first generation (typical) antipsychotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a>) or benzodiazepine alone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) or a combination of a first generation antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine (eg, droperidol and midazolam, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>).

Some patients may have paradoxical reactions and become more agitated after receiving a particular medication. In such cases, no additional agents from this class should be given and only alternative classes used.</p><p>The use of injectable medications may be viewed as an assault by the patient, invoking images of punishment and incarceration rather than therapy and relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. For the agitated but nonviolent patient willing to cooperate with treatment, the use of oral medication may be as effective as a parenteral form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>In 2006 the American College of Emergency Physicians published a clinical policy that discusses pharmacologic treatment for the acutely agitated patient in the emergency department (ED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], while in 2012 a workgroup of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry published recommendations for the management of agitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. These guidelines reflect common practice in many EDs throughout the United States.</p><p>Our approach to chemical sedation is based on the available, albeit limited, evidence and our clinical experience. As many agitated or violent patients presenting to emergency departments are not well known to the clinicians providing the initial care, we prefer to use medications with proven efficacy and relative safety. We recognize that psychiatrists who either know the patient or are more experienced in the diagnosis and management of particular psychiatric conditions may prefer to use different medications for chemical sedation and this is reasonable and appropriate.

Case reports describing the use of ketamine in agitated delirium have involved young adults, and clinicians may wish to avoid ketamine in patients experiencing agitated delirium who are older, have known heart disease, or are at increased risk of heart disease, as ketamine causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. While the use of ketamine for agitation is increasing, caution is needed until higher quality evidence confirms the safety and effectiveness of this approach. The properties of ketamine and its use for procedural sedation in adults are reviewed separately.

Notable side effects may include hypertension and tachycardia (usually mild and transient), laryngospasm (uncommon), emergence reactions, and vomiting. Side effects may be more common with rapid IV administration. Although respiratory complications are uncommon, clinicians using ketamine must be prepared to manage airway obstruction.

Patients over the age of 40 with new psychiatric symptoms are more likely to have an organic cause. Elderly patients are at higher risk for organic delirium due to medical illness or adverse reactions to medications. Patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse may exhibit violent behavior as a manifestation of an intoxication or withdrawal syndrome. The acute onset of agitated behavior suggests an organic etiology. Most psychiatric patients are alert and oriented and have a history of psychiatric illness. The differentiation of medical from psychiatric disorders, the evaluation of delirium and confusional states, and the general assessment of drug overdose patients are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The medical record should reflect that the emergency department (ED) evaluation makes an acute medical condition unlikely to have caused or contributed to the patient's behavior. If the etiology of the patient's violent behavior is due to drug or alcohol intoxication, the patient should be observed until he has reached the point where a therapeutic interview can be conducted by the psychiatrist. Alternatively, the patient may be transported to a facility where he can be observed until the effects of the intoxicants have abated.</p><p>Rather than pronouncing the patient &quot;medically clear&quot; the clinician should clearly convey his findings and recommendations directly to the consulting psychiatrist. After the violent patient has been medically evaluated, a decision must be made to begin commitment proceedings or discharge the patient. Admission is appropriate for violent patients who state specific intentions to hurt themselves or others, refuse to answer questions or cooperate, are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, are psychotic, or have an organic brain syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/25,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,122</a>].</p><p>Discharge may be appropriate if the violent behavior was caused by a temporary organic syndrome (eg, intoxication), medical and psychiatric evaluation reveals no other significant problem requiring acute intervention, and the patient is deemed in control and no longer violent. All discharged patients should be given specific follow-up evaluation and discharge instructions.</p><p>If a violent patient escapes the ED, law enforcement authorities should be notified. If the patient threatened violence to a specific individual before escape, that individual should be notified as well. If the patient has committed a violent act, it is often possible to discharge the patient in police custody. Jail is a safe disposition as long as authorities are warned of potential danger.

If assaulted, immediately summon help, preferably by use of a panic button. Maintain a sideward posture, keeping the arms ready for self-protection. If faced with a punch or a kick, deflect with an arm or a leg. If choking is attempted, tuck the chin in to protect the airway and carotid arteries.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the emergency department (ED), drug and alcohol intoxication or withdrawal are the most common causes of severe agitation. Fingerstick glucose, pulse oximetry, and a complete set of vital signs should be obtained in all combative patients. It is important to assess for potentially dangerous organic causes of agitation as soon as this can be done safely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82146 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Post-restraint medical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians are largely under-protected and under-prepared to prevent and manage violent patients. A number of prevention measures are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Violence prevention in the emergency department'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic safety measures should be followed during all interviews with potentially violent patients. All patients must be disarmed before an interview. The setting should be private but not isolated, and no obstacle should exist between the clinician and the exit. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Interview preparation and setting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male gender, a history of violence, and drug or alcohol abuse are associated with violence. Signs of impending violence include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provocative behavior</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angry demeanor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loud, aggressive speech</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tense posturing (eg, gripping arm rails tightly, clenching fists)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Frequently changing body position, pacing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aggressive acts (eg, pounding walls, throwing objects, hitting oneself) (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Actively violent patients and uncooperative, agitated patients, particularly those who exhibit signs of impending violence, require immediate restraint. Assume that all violent patients are armed until proven otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients who present with agitation or violent behavior deserve the chance to calm down in response to verbal techniques. The following suggestions increase the likelihood of a successful interview:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adopt an honest, non-threatening, and straightforward manner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perform friendly gestures (eg, offer food).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Listen to the patient: Identify and confirm their feelings and desires. Offer choices and optimism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid direct eye contact; do not approach the patient from behind or move suddenly; stand at least two arm's lengths away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Address violence directly: The patient should be asked relevant questions, such as, &quot;Do you feel like hurting yourself or someone else?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid arguing, machismo, condescension, or commanding the patient to calm down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Never lie to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Take all threats seriously. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Verbal techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical restraints can be used when, despite a proper approach to the combative patient, verbal techniques are unsuccessful. The implementation of physical restraints is described in the text. Every restrained patient must be carefully and frequently monitored. Physical restraints should be removed as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical restraints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid tranquilization may be required in the agitated or violent patient. A treatment algorithm outlining our approach to chemical sedation of the acutely agitated patient, including specific medication suggestions, is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61852 \">algorithm 1</a>). In summary, we suggest the following approach for the chemical sedation of acutely agitated or violent patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For severely violent patients requiring immediate sedation, we suggest treatment with a rapidly acting first generation (typical) antipsychotic alone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a>), a rapidly acting benzodiazepine alone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>), or a combination of a first generation antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine (eg, midazolam and droperidol, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with agitation from drug intoxication or withdrawal, we suggest treatment with a benzodiazepine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with undifferentiated agitation, we suggest treatment with benzodiazepines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). First generation antipsychotics are also a reasonable choice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For agitated patients with a known psychiatric disorder, we suggest treatment with first generation antipsychotic agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Second generation antipsychotics are also a reasonable choice.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Roca RP, Charen B, Boronow J.
