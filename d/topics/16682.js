Patients who are susceptible to MH have skeletal muscle receptor abnormalities that allow excessive myoplasmic calcium to accumulate in the presence of certain anesthetic triggering agents. Very little is known about the specific mechanisms by which anesthetics interact with these abnormal receptors to trigger an MH crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Susceptibility to MH (MHS) may arise de novo or be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It is suspected in individuals with a history of a clinical event strongly suspicious for an acute MH crisis or with a family history of susceptibility. The mainstay of prevention is the identification of these genetically susceptible individuals. Avoidance of anesthetic triggers in MHS patients and prompt administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a> when an acute event occurs have reduced the mortality associated with malignant hyperthermia from historic rates of 70 percent to &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the genetic basis and testing for MHS and the safe administration of anesthesia to MHS patients. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of an acute MH crisis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant hyperthermia: Clinical diagnosis and management of acute crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336378118\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MHS) in the general population is unknown, though it is estimated at 1:2000 by the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Published rates of susceptibility vary widely depending upon the population studied and the manner in which MHS was determined. Prevalence is most often studied in family cohorts of patients known to be MHS; rates range from 1:200 to 1:5000 in these cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity lead to far fewer cases of clinically significant MH than gene prevalence rates would suggest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCATION OF MUTATIONS CAUSING MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA SUSCEPTIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MHS) is conferred by mutations of genes associated with proteins controlling levels of cytosolic calcium and, therefore, skeletal muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Approximately one-half of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion; others are presumed to be new mutations. Genes responsible for coding proteins of the calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum are most commonly affected: the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and the closely associated dihydropyridine receptor (DHP). The likelihood that a susceptible patient will develop MH depends upon the specific type of receptor mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Because of incomplete genetic penetrance and variable expressivity, there is great variability in the clinical expression of the syndrome among individuals and between anesthetic episodes in the same individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant hyperthermia: Clinical diagnosis and management of acute crisis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of known cases of MH are caused by mutations on chromosome 19 in regions that encode the hydrophilic, amino-terminal portion of the RYR1 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. Although nearly 700 distinct mutations in this region have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-26</a>]; only 35have been formally shown to be causative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; the remainder await confirmatory studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The majority of MH-related mutations in the RYR1 gene are located in one of three &quot;hot spots&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A small number of known MH-related mutations (approximately 1 percent) are caused by a mutation of the gene for the DHP receptor located on chromosome 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22-26</a>].

Patients with myopathies caused by ryanodine receptor (RYR1) mutations, notably central core myopathy, are assumed to be MHS. Patients with a history of unexpected exertional rhabdomyolysis (under conditions that are less extreme than the usual triggers) may also have a higher than normal risk of MHS and should be treated as MHS unless contracture biopsy testing is negative. In addition, patients with severe statin-induced myopathy may be at increased risk for having the RYR1 mutation, and should receive non-triggering anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Patients with several other muscle diseases, notably Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, develop rhabdomyolysis and severe hyperkalemia when exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (and possibly with volatile anesthetics); although this is not MH, anesthetic considerations are similar (ie, avoid succinylcholine and consider avoiding volatile anesthetics). For patients with other muscle diseases with sporadic case reports of rhabdomyolysis related to these agents, non-triggering anesthetics have been administered as a precaution, although there is no evidence of MHS.

The possibility of a common etiology is illustrated by a series of six patients with a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis and positive contracture tests, in which five had RYR1 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These findings were confirmed in a Canadian cohort of patients with a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis and a subsequent positive MH contracture biopsy and known MH-causative mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Because of these findings, some experts, including this author, advocate treating patients with a history of unexpected heat- or exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis as MHS, and recommend genetic testing for the RYR1 mutation.

While this clinical syndrome can closely resemble acute MH and is related to abnormal calcium release in the muscle, the etiology is thought to be different.

This is primarily done by obtaining a personal and family history of prior adverse reactions to anesthetics and examining these events in detail; there are no practical MH susceptibility (MHS) screening tests.

Approximately half of patients who develop acute MH have one or two uneventful exposures to triggering agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>], and many patients who develop MH have had multiple previous uneventful anesthetics that included administration of triggering agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">MH clinical grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MH clinical grading scale is used to judge the likelihood that a prior event represents true MH; this helps provide guidance in patient counseling.

The caffeine-halothane contracture test (CHCT), used in North America, is discussed here. Results are reported as positive or negative. The test is highly sensitive, so negative results generally rule out a diagnosis of MHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. However, there is up to a 20 percent false-positive rate, so positive results should be followed up with genetic testing.</p><p>In lieu of (or following) contracture testing, some patients with suspected MHS will opt for molecular genetic testing. This is a noninvasive and less costly option, but not all mutations causing MHS have been identified, leading to a low sensitivity (&lt;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/26,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,76</a>].

Some patients prefer to simply consider themselves (and their family members) MHS. They do not undergo contracture testing as it involves a surgical procedure and significant travel and cost; in the United States, there are only four testing centers, and costs may not be covered by insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Also, they do not undergo genetic testing since there is a very high false-negative rate.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MHS individuals have skeletal muscle receptor abnormalities, allowing excessive intracellular calcium to accumulate in response to volatile anesthetic agents or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>; this triggers intracellular events, leading to skeletal muscle hypermetabolism. Genes known to be responsible for coding calcium channel proteins (RYR1) and receptors (DHP) are responsible for approximately 30 to 50 percent of the mutations known to cause MHS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Location of mutations causing malignant hyperthermia susceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MHS is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Its prevalence is unknown but is estimated at 1:2000. Due to variable penetrance, not all exposures of MHS patients to triggering agents result in MH crisis. (See <a href=\"#H336378118\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstay of prevention is the identification of MHS individuals. MHS is suspected in patients with a prior clinical event with signs of MH and confirmed by susceptibility testing. A clinical grading scale for possible MH events assists in determining whether past events were actually MH. (See <a href=\"#H336379131\" class=\"local\">'Identification of malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'MH clinical grading'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with some muscle diseases have genetic abnormalities in RYR1 or DHP receptors that also make the patient MHS; these include central core myopathy, multiminicore myopathy, Native American myopathy, and King-Denborough syndrome. There is some evidence that individuals with a history of exercise- or heat-induced rhabdomyolysis, and those with severe statin induced myopathy, may also have a higher incidence of MHS than the general population. Therefore, these patients should be assumed to be MHS unless they have tested negative. (See <a href=\"#H130378866\" class=\"local\">'Myopathies with ryanodine receptor abnormalities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H130379109\" class=\"local\">'Exertional rhabdomyolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some conditions characterized by muscle atrophy are associated with an increased risk for life-threatening rhabdomyolysis or hyperkalemia following volatile anesthetic or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> administration. This clinical syndrome may resemble, but is not, acute MH. These include the dystrophinopathies, myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, McArdle disease, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase type 2 deficiency. These patients are not MHS, but the MH-triggering agents should not be given. (See <a href=\"#H112418375\" class=\"local\">'Muscle disorders with intraoperative rhabdomyolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no practical MH-susceptibility screening tests for the general population. Testing for MHS is indicated only under specific circumstances, generally in a patient with an event suspicious for MH or in family members of a patient with positive tests. (See <a href=\"#H336379131\" class=\"local\">'Identification of malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contracture testing is the preferred initial test for individuals with an event suspicious for MH and some preexisting conditions. However, contracture testing is invasive and offered at only a limited number of centers. Contracture testing has few false negatives; a negative test effectively rules out MH susceptibility. The Caffeine Halothane Contracture Test (used in North America) has about a 20 percent false-positive rate; positive results should be followed up with genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Contracture test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic testing is indicated in individuals with a positive contracture test, positive family history for a gene mutation, and those who are unable or unwilling to undergo contracture testing. Genetic testing identifies approximately 50 percent of MH-susceptible individuals.(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Genetic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients considered MHS who need anesthesia may safely have general anesthesia, administered without triggering agents (volatile anesthetic gasses and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>). Anesthesia machines should be cleaned of trace gases, and an MH cart with supplies and medications to manage acute MH (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a>) should be available on site prior to anesthetic administration.
