Despite the availability of effective vaccines since 1982, HBV infection has remained endemic in many localities, with more than 350 million chronic HBV carriers worldwide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HBV infection in dialysis patients presents a distinct clinical problem in view of the immunosuppressive effect of renal failure, the susceptibility for de novo infection and nosocomial transmission, the long-term implications on morbidity and mortality, and the change in clinical course after kidney transplantation. The natural history of HBV infection in dialysis patients may also vary according to the timing of infection, genotype, and thus locality.</p><p>In endemic areas, most adult dialysis patients with HBV infection are chronic carriers who acquired HBV infection during early childhood. By comparison, HBV infection in nonendemic areas is often acquired during adulthood. Dialysis patients are more prone to become chronic carriers, compared with patients without renal failure, due to their immunosuppressed state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The majority of newly HBV-infected dialysis patients have a relatively mild clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infected patients are often asymptomatic and have normal or only slightly elevated serum transaminase levels. The impact of HBV infection per se on the survival of dialysis patients is relatively small, especially since antiviral therapies are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>By comparison, there is a significant risk of clinical deterioration in the HBV-infected renal transplant recipient. The risk of severe, life-threatening complications is highest when de novo HBV infection occurs shortly after a patient is given heavy immunosuppression (eg, in the initial posttransplant period or after treatment of rejection), but hepatitic flares and liver-related complications can occur at any time after kidney transplantation in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive kidney transplant recipients, including those who have been asymptomatic HBV carriers during dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Therefore, despite the relatively benign clinical disease in dialysis patients, the importance of preventing and treating HBV infection in dialysis patients must be underscored.</p><p>This topic review will discuss HBV infection among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reviews of different aspects of HBV infection in patients without renal failure can be found separately (see appropriate topic reviews). Renal disease resulting from HBV infection and the interplay between HBV infection and the renal transplant recipient are also discussed elsewhere.

The annual incidence of HBV infection among dialysis patients, which was 0.12 percent in 2002, has remained relatively stable over the past decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>HBsAg positivity rates in dialysis patients correlate with endemicity in the general population, as illustrated by the prevalence rates within Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

The preparation of injectable medications on a cart or in a location within the hemodialysis treatment area is associated with a higher incidence rate for HBV infection compared with centers that prepared these medications in a dedicated medication room (2002 incidence rates of 0.27 and 0.06 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of HBV infection in dialysis units'</a> below.)</p><p>Occult hepatitis B, when HBV DNA is detected in the serum of an HBsAg-negative patient, though uncommon (affecting not more than 3 percent of hemodialysis patients), is often associated with low levels of HBV DNA and presents a risk for nosocomial transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. This can be associated with deletions in the pre-S1 region of the viral genome, which affected the S promoter, thereby reducing the production of HBsAg while minute amounts of transcriptionally active HBV DNA could be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or serum samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Crucial to preventing nosocomial transmission is the implementation of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adherence to (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of HBV infection in dialysis units'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B vaccination'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard or universal precautionary measures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis unit procedures for the prevention of bloodborne infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B vaccination of nonimmune individuals</p><p/><p>Outbreaks of HBV infection in dialysis units are often attributed to failure to adhere to universal precautions or the omission of initial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periodic HBsAg screening for patients, the sharing of multidose vials or blood-contact equipment, and failure to reduce the susceptible pool of patients by vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although HBV DNA traverses the dialyzer membrane during high-flux dialysis, the degree of infectivity of dialysate and ultrafiltrate remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients on peritoneal dialysis have a lower risk of acquiring HBV infection compared with those on long-term hemodialysis. There is a reported 19-fold difference in seroconversion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF HBV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HBV is a partly double-stranded circular DNA virus. The complete infectious virion (Dane particle) consists of a 42 nm spherical envelope carrying the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a 27 nm inner shell of nucleocapsid with the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), and a processing derivative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The viral genome and its tightly associated DNA polymerase are located within the inner nucleocapsid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis B virus and pathogenesis of infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conventional diagnosis of current or past HBV infection is based on immunoassays for HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc, HBeAg, and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe), combinations of which can indicate the stage of infection, viral replication and infectivity, and the immune status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Although seropositivity for HBeAg has often been used as a surrogate marker for viral replication, it is unreliable in infections by precore or core promoter HBV mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to the serum levels of liver enzymes, which reflect hepatocyte lysis, measurement of HBV DNA in serum provides direct qualitative or quantitative information on viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HBV DNA offer increased sensitivity, with detection threshold down to 20 international units or 10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>In the majority of dialysis patients, testing for HBsAg is sufficient for the diagnosis of HBV infection. Nevertheless, a negative HBsAg test does not preclude absolutely the presence of occult HBV infection. Occult HBV infection has been defined by positivity in nested PCR assays for the <span class=\"nowrap\">pre-S/S,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">pre-Core/Core,</span> and X viral regions with sensitivity down to below 2 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> and the results showed a generally low prevalence of occult HBV infection, with HBV DNA detected in less than 5 percent of subjects with isolated anti-HBc seropositivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The prevalence of occult HBV infection is related to endemicity of HBV infection in the general population, and the level of viremia in occult HBV infection is usually low, with HBV DNA level mostly below 10 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Transient false seropositivity for HBsAg can occur in subjects who have recently received HBV vaccination.</p><p>In patients with chronic HBV infection, determination of <span class=\"nowrap\">HBeAg/anti-HBe</span> status is indicated in case of hepatitis flare or when antiviral treatment is considered. Serial testing of alpha-fetal protein levels is important for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in HBsAg-positive patients. Testing for HBV DNA may be indicated in patients with hepatitis who are positive for anti-HBc but negative for HBsAg, anti-HBs, hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA.</p><p>A detailed discussion concerning the diagnosis and monitoring of HBV infection can be found elsewhere.

Consequently, dialysis patients, in particular those on hemodialysis, are at risk for nosocomial HBV infection. The latter has been related to inadequate infection control measures or technical breaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>To prevent nosocomial transmission, standard precautionary measures must be rigorously followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These include barrier procedures to prevent exposure to bloodborne micro-organisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing hands after contact with potentially infectious surface or material</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing gloves when contacting potentially infectious surface or material</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a face mask and gown when exposure to blood or body fluids is expected</p><p/><p>In addition to these standard precautions, measures specific to hemodialysis units are also important to prevent nosocomial HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing gloves before contact with patients or dialysis equipment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prohibition of sharing instruments or medications among patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparing and distributing medications from a centralized area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding the use of medication supply carts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular screening of HBsAg status (at least annually) in nonimmune individuals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B vaccination of patients and staff (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B vaccination'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Treatment of HBV-infected hemodialysis patients with nucleotide or nucleoside analogs may also reduce the risk of other hemodialysis patients in the same center acquiring HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This is consistent with the well-established association between the risk of nosocomial transmission and the prevalence of HBsAg-positive patients in a hemodialysis center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Segregation and reuse of dialyzers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to segregate and use dedicated hemodialysis machines for HBsAg-positive patients is associated with an increased incidence of HBV infection, and machine segregation is now standard practice. On the other hand, the United States national surveillance in 1997 showed no difference in the incidence of HBV infection between centers that practiced segregation of dialysis rooms and those that did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/16,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,43</a>]. Dialyzer reuse was also not associated with a higher risk of HBV infection both in patients and in staff. Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that dialyzers from HBsAg<strong>-</strong>positive patients be excluded from reuse programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B VACCINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccination is important both to prevent susceptible patients from acquiring HBV and to reduce the pool of HBV-infected patients. In a case-control study, the risk of HBV infection in hemodialysis patients was reduced by 70 percent after hepatitis B vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It is imperative that HBV vaccination be performed early in the course of renal failure in nonimmune subjects since seroconversion response correlates with the level of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Issues surrounding hepatitis B vaccination in dialysis patients are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in patients with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing during the acute or chronic phases of HBV infection can reveal elevations in the concentration of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels (ALT and AST). However, hypotransaminasemia is a well-recognized feature in dialysis patients with or without liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Consequently, the normal range of transaminases should be adjusted downwards; otherwise, the incidence or severity of clinical liver disease might be underestimated. In this regard, levels of 24 and 17 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> have been recommended as the upper limits of normal for AST and ALT, respectively, in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum enzymes in patients with renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manifestation of acute HBV infection in dialysis patients is extremely variable. The majority of dialysis patients with new HBV infection are either asymptomatic or have mild clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Serum transaminase levels are either normal or only slightly elevated. This also relates to the lower values of the normal range in these patients. It is not uncommon that the diagnosis of HBV infection is made through regular surveillance testing.</p><p>The serotype of HBV may affect the severity of clinical manifestations. As an example, an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis resulting in four mortalities in a dialysis center in Tokyo was attributed to infection by a precore mutant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Acute hepatitis B in dialysis patients is more likely to result in chronic infection compared with nonimmunosuppressed individuals. Up to 80 percent of acutely infected dialysis patients may become chronic carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manifestations of chronic hepatitis B or HBV-induced cirrhosis in dialysis patients are identical to those without renal failure. Aminotransferase levels indicate hepatitic activity but need to be interpreted according to the adjusted normal ranges. The level of gamma glutamyltranspeptidase may be increased, which could signify bile duct injury. Progression of liver disease manifests as hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and development of complications such as hypersplenism, ascites, esophageal varices, or hepatic encephalopathy. Considerations for combined liver and renal transplantation may be warranted in dialysis patients with severe, irreversible liver disease. Coinfection with the hepatitis D virus can lead to more severe liver disease and needs to be investigated when clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There have been few studies on the histologic manifestations of chronic hepatitis B in dialysis patients, particularly related to its long-term evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Liver pathology, such as piecemeal necrosis, portal inflammation, or fibrosis, is similar to patients without renal failure.</p><p>Although early data suggested inferior clinical outcomes in HBV-infected dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the majority of studies have not indicated significant differences in morbidity and mortality between HBV surface antigen (HbsAg)-positive and negative dialysis patients, especially after the advent of nucleoside(tide) analog therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/4,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,50</a>]. Fewer than 5 percent of these patients die from liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/4,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,50</a>]. The adverse impact of HBV infection on the survival rate of dialysis patients appears much lower compared with infections and vascular complications, which are the leading causes of death.</p><p>Cirrhosis has been associated with a 35 percent increase in mortality rate among dialysis patients; however, whether HBV infection alone has an adverse effect on patient survival remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Before the advent of nucleoside or nucleotide antiviral medications, the prognostic impact of HBV infection was even worse in renal allograft recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/8,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis patients with chronic HBV infection should have regular monitoring of parenchymal and ductal liver enzymes and serum albumin concentration, preferably at 6- to 12-week intervals. Prothrombin time should also be measured when there is evidence of severe hepatitis or cirrhosis. In addition, serum alpha-fetal protein levels should be measured at least every six months and liver ultrasound performed at least annually.</p><p>Since the biochemical manifestations often cannot reliably indicate the status of liver histology, it would be ideal if a liver biopsy is available to best assess the activity of HBV-related liver disease and the extent of cirrhotic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/48,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55</a>]. However, the role and optimal timing of liver biopsy in otherwise asymptomatic patients without clinical or biochemical abnormalities remain to be defined. Decisions on management for an individual patient must also take into consideration the level of HBV DNA in serum and the timing of kidney transplantation.</p><p>For practical purposes, liver biopsy is advisable when antiviral treatment is being considered. Availability of histologic information is also preferred before kidney transplantation to ascertain the activity of hepatitis and the degree of cirrhosis. However, while it is easy to arrange liver biopsy before living-donor kidney transplantation, the optimal timing for this procedure may be difficult to establish in localities with a long waiting time for transplantation. The role of liver stiffness measurement using transient elastography in dialysis patients remains to be established as hemodialysis treatment can affect the result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions on the treatment of chronic HBV infection are based in part upon an accurate assessment of the presence or absence of virus replication and active liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. As previously mentioned, this usually involves testing for HBV DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), measuring the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration with or without a liver biopsy. Treatment is often indicated when abnormal ALT levels suggest evidence of hepatic inflammation and HBV DNA levels are over 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. Based upon these and other clinical findings, optimal therapy may involve the administration of interferon alfa, nucleoside or nucleotide analogs, combination therapy, liver transplantation, or only observation.

Such resistance, occurring in approximately 15 percent of patients after 12 months, more than 30 percent after two years, and over half of patients after three years of lamivudine therapy, is almost universally associated with mutations in the highly conserved YMDD (tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, aspartate) nucleotide-binding motif of the major catalytic domain of the HBV RNA dependent DNA polymerase. The emergence of lamivudine resistance can be associated with potentially life-threatening exacerbation of liver disease. Lamivudine is no longer regarded as the preferred first-line therapy for hepatitis B.

Nephrotoxicity is a side effect of both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a> and tenofovir, but tenofovir given at doses adjusted according to renal function appeared relatively safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-and-dialysis-patients/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

HBV infection in dialysis patients presents a distinct clinical problem in view of the immunosuppressive effect of renal failure, the susceptibility for de novo infection and nosocomial transmission, the long-term implications on morbidity and mortality, and the change in clinical course after kidney transplantation. The natural history of HBV infection in dialysis patients may also vary according to the timing of infection and genotype. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis patients are at increased risk of contracting hepatitis B due to nosocomial transmission. Prevention of HBV infection through universal precautions and vaccination is of critical importance. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for HBV infection in dialysis units'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of HBV infection in dialysis units'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of dialysis patients, testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is sufficient for the diagnosis of HBV infection. Nevertheless, a negative HBsAg test does not preclude absolutely the presence of occult HBV infection. The level of viremia in patients with occult hepatitis B is generally low. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of HBV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The manifestations of acute HBV infection in dialysis patients are variable. The manifestations of chronic hepatitis B or HBV-induced cirrhosis in dialysis patients are identical to those without renal failure. Aminotransferase levels indicate hepatitic activity but need to be interpreted according to the adjusted normal range, which is lower in patients on long-term dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the clinical course of HBV infection in dialysis patients appears less severe, the aim of management is to minimize the progression of liver disease and for the early detection of liver complications including hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment is indicated in HBsAg-positive patients with evidence of disease activity, as indicated by viral replication and abnormal transaminase levels, preferably corroborated by examination of liver histology. A level of 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for HBV DNA is usually taken as the threshold to start treatment. It is important to realize that hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be negative in patients with precore- or core promotor-mutant infection despite active disease. In view of the side effects of interferon in patients on dialysis, nucleotide or nucleoside analogs are better choices. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a> or tenofovir are the recommended first-line oral agents for HBV infection in patients with kidney diseases. The doses of all medications must be adjusted appropriately according to renal function.
