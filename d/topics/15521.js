Of these, approximately 20 percent can be attributed to the consequences of coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients with varying stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but who are not yet dialysis dependent also have a markedly increased risk of morbidity and mortality from CVD, including CHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with established CVD have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death from CVD. Compared with the general population, patients undergoing maintenance dialysis have a significantly increased incidence of CVD. This is due to both an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors for CVD and risk factors due to the severe loss of kidney function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and epidemiology of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A discussion of risk-factor modification for CVD by therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) and drug therapies among patients undergoing maintenance dialysis will be presented in this topic review. Although many of the issues relating to CHD are presumably similar in patients with and without renal failure, this topic review will emphasize those features that distinguish the dialysis patient from those without renal dysfunction. Discussions of this issue in patients with CKD who are not yet on dialysis as well as those without kidney disease are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CORONARY HEART DISEASE RISK EQUIVALENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD), such as those with diabetes, have a risk of subsequent cardiovascular events that is comparable with that seen in patients with established coronary disease. Such patients are regarded as having a CHD risk equivalent.</p><p>We agree with the practice guidelines from several national organizations, which recommend that chronic kidney disease (CKD), including ESRD, be considered a CHD risk equivalent. This is based upon evidence that renal dysfunction (even of a mild degree) is associated with an increase in CHD risk, with renal dysfunction defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or significant albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Data have also emphasized the importance of albuminuria as a risk factor independent of GFR.

In patients with established CHD, these measures are referred to as &quot;secondary prevention&quot; or prevention of complications due to established disease.</p><p>Evidence of benefit with cardiovascular risk factor modification has largely been shown in patients without CKD. By comparison, most interventions have not been rigorously examined, and very few interventions in dialysis patients have been shown to be effective. Risk factor modification for secondary prevention in dialysis patients will be reviewed here, with the evidence examining each of the possible modalities.</p><p>Detailed discussions of each risk factor in those without renal disease and the efficacy of primary prevention of CVD and stroke are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of primary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LIPID MODIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients without kidney disease, there is a graded relationship between the serum total cholesterol concentration and coronary risk, and the absolute risk is greater in patients with previous manifestations of coronary disease. During the past two decades, many large, randomized trials in patients with normal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> modestly reduced renal function have demonstrated the benefit of lipid lowering, almost entirely with statin therapy, for secondary prevention. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Despite a substantial decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, both trials found that the initiation of statin therapy provided <strong>no</strong> cardiovascular benefit in primary analysis. In apparent contrast, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial showed a benefit of pharmacologic therapy using the combination of statin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> in the entire study cohort, which included nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients, but the effect was not statistically significant in the dialysis subgroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Trials of statin therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of whether statins are effective in lowering the risk of a cardiovascular event in dialysis patients was addressed in the 4-D, AURORA, and SHARP trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">4-D trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 4-D study, 1255 hemodialysis patients (80 percent were not being treated with a statin) with type 2 diabetes and elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels were randomly assigned to placebo or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The primary outcome measure was the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke. After four weeks, atorvastatin successfully lowered LDL-cholesterol (121 to 72 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.1 to 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> versus no change with placebo (125 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.2 to 3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p>At a median follow-up of four years, however, there was no difference in the incidence of the primary outcome between both groups (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.77-1.10).

On the other hand, there was a significant and apparently paradoxical increase in the rate of fatal stroke (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.05-3.93), but the absolute number of stroke events was small in both the statin and the placebo groups.</p><p>A post-hoc analysis that stratified patients by LDL-cholesterol concentration demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome among those with a baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration &gt;145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.76 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among such patients, there were also reductions in risk for cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, nonfatal MI, and for all cardiac deaths combined.

The individual components of the primary composite endpoint as well as all-cause mortality were also not significantly different between the two groups. Active therapy did not provide benefit for any analyzed, prespecified subgroup, including those with diabetes or elevated C-reactive protein levels. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rosuvastatin</a> was not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events.</p><p>A post-hoc analysis of 731 diabetic patients from AURORA also showed no difference in the composite outcome or in the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The rosuvastatin group had a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke compared with placebo, although the number of events was small (12 versus 2, respectively).

We include in this group peritoneal dialysis patients, although the data on peritoneal dialysis patients are more sparse than those on hemodialysis patients, despite being at high overall cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Despite significant reductions in mean serum LDL-cholesterol levels, the 4-D, AURORA, and SHARP trials found no definite clinical benefit with statin therapy in hemodialysis patients. However, as noted above, primary analysis of the SHARP trial showed a decrease in atherosclerotic events in the entire cohort that included both dialysis and nondialysis-dependent CKD patients and a trend towards benefit in atherosclerotic events in the dialysis subgroup, and post-hoc analyses of AURORA and 4-D showed benefits among diabetic patients and among those with an LDL-cholesterol concentration &gt;145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.76 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively. In addition, one meta-analysis including all three trials showed a modest benefit in atherosclerotic-related events, while another found no benefit of statin treatment in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major cardiovascular events. (See <a href=\"#H878000148\" class=\"local\">'Meta-analyses'</a> above.)</p><p>By comparison, randomized, prospective studies have reported consistent and robust improvements in cardiovascular outcomes with statin therapy in patients with normal kidney function at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. In addition, meta-analyses and post-hoc analyses of studies of patients with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction have noted benefits with statin therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most likely explanation for these discordant results is that the pathogenic processes for adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with ESRD differ from those with either mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction or normal kidney function. In the dialysis population, approximately 60 percent of all cardiac deaths are presumably due to sudden death or arrhythmias, and the underlying diseases that trigger the sudden death or arrhythmias are unclear. There is a markedly increased prevalence of myocardial abnormalities such as left ventricular hypertrophy (present in approximately 75 percent of dialysis patients) and alterations in myocardial ultrastructure and function; atheromatous coronary lesions are thought by some investigators to be less important than the nonatherosclerotic diseases, such as nonischemic cardiac fibrosis, in maintenance dialysis patients. The supportive data for these conclusions are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We also agree that statin therapy be continued in patients who are already receiving statins or a <span class=\"nowrap\">statin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a></span> combination at the time of initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], especially in those patients with significantly elevated serum levels of LDL-cholesterol, largely due to the overwhelming evidence of benefit in the general population and limited data in the dialysis population. However, some clinicians would withdraw statin therapy in dialysis patients based upon the lack of benefit in 4-D and AURORA. The question of whether to withdraw statin therapy in dialysis patients already being treated with these agents has not been addressed in randomized trials. Both 4-D and AURORA trials had a large number of patients who discontinued the study medication, but this was most commonly due to achieving a study endpoint or undergoing kidney transplantation.</p><p>Our overall recommendation not to routinely administer statins to dialysis patients does not necessarily apply to those with very high serum LDL-cholesterol levels (such as &gt;145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> as the post-hoc analysis of the 4-D trial showed an apparent beneficial effect in patients in that subgroup. This uncertainty is particularly poignant for patients with very high LDL-cholesterol (eg, &gt;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> since those patients might not have been enrolled in AURORA, because of the potential reluctance of nephrologists to refer these patients to the randomized trial.

The role of fish oil for prevention of AV graft thrombosis is discussed separately.

However, unlike that found in the general population, there are few studies showing beneficial cardiovascular outcomes with smoking cessation in dialysis patients. In a post-hoc analysis of the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, including 1842 hemodialysis patients, there was a trend toward an increase in risk of cardiovascular mortality among current smokers compared with former smokers, but this was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In this analysis, the population-attributable fractions (ie, the fraction of observed deaths that may have been avoided) were 5.3 for current smokers versus patients who never smoked and 2.1 for current versus former smokers. We recommend that dialysis patients completely stop smoking, given the marked benefits of smoking cessation observed in the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-risk-of-smoking-and-benefits-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular risk of smoking and benefits of smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight reduction &ndash; In those with normal renal function, obesity is associated with an increased risk for CVD. By comparison, the benefits of weight reduction in dialysis patients are unclear. In fact, there appears to be a survival advantage in obese dialysis patients. The higher mortality risks in dialysis patients with lower body mass indices (BMIs) may be attributed to malnutrition. Limited data suggest that increased muscle mass confers greater survival advantage than increased fat in the dialysis population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, we do not currently recommend weight reduction for dialysis patients, although it is reasonable to recommend an increase in muscle rather than fat. Weight reduction, however, should be considered in morbidly obese patients, especially in those who are planning kidney transplant surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; Regular exercise has a variety of possible cardiovascular benefits in those with normal renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By comparison, a paucity of data exists concerning the association between cardiovascular benefits, survival, and exercise in dialysis patients. This was examined using data for 2507 patients from the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Wave II Study (DMMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Decreased mortality was associated with patients who exercised two to three and four to five times per week. However, for unclear reasons, daily exercise provided no survival benefit. Nonetheless, gradual increase in physical activity is probably beneficial in most dialysis patients and should be encouraged unless there are specific medical contraindications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular risk factor modification should be undertaken for dialysis patients, given that they are considered a coronary heart disease (CHD) equivalent. In dialysis patients, these measures are referred to as &quot;secondary prevention.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Coronary heart disease risk equivalent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview of secondary prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> initiating statin therapy in dialysis patients with no, mild, or moderate increase in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, pending more definitive data (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest continuing statin therapy in dialysis patients currently receiving these agents unless side effects develop (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, some clinicians would withdraw statin therapy in dialysis patients based upon the lack of benefit. In dialysis patients with very high LDL-cholesterol levels, the initiation of statins may be reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lipid modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These recommendations concerning the use of statins do not apply to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not on dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse outcomes appear to be generally associated with very high blood pressure (BP) in dialysis patients. We aim for a predialysis BP value below <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> on minimal medications, if possible. However, this target BP level should be individualized, partly depending upon symptoms of intradialytic hypotension. In some patients, targeting predialysis BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> may not be appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in dialysis patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The dose of aspirin is 81 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Dialysis patients who would prefer to avoid the increased risk of bleeding for an unproven cardiovascular benefit may reasonably choose to forgo aspirin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for secondary prevention in dialysis patients is discussed in detail separately.

Despite this, we generally aim for a calcium x phosphate product &lt;55 mg<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL<sup>2</sup></span> using current therapeutic options. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Mineral metabolism issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not administer any therapy for the purpose of improving cardiovascular outcomes by lowering homocysteine levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oxidative stress.
