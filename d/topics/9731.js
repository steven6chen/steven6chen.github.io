The most important treatment-related issues include the identification of those who can be adequately managed without total cystectomy, those who need radical cystectomy, and those who require a combined modality approach that may include chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (RT).</p><p>Radical cystectomy is the treatment of choice for <span class=\"nowrap\">high-risk/recurrent</span> non-muscle-invasive disease as well as organ-confined muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Traditionally, radical cystectomy has been performed using an open approach that allows wide excision of the bladder, extended lymph node dissection, and a full range of urinary diversion.</p><p>The goal of minimally invasive radical cystectomy (currently most often performed with robot assistance) is to reproduce the oncologic results of an open procedure, while decreasing the surgical complications and postoperative recovery time. Laparoscopy was first used for removal of the urinary bladder in 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and subsequent advances have evolved towards a robotic-assisted intracorporeal approach to include extended lymph node dissection and totally intracorporeal urinary diversion.</p><p>The technical aspects of <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> radical cystectomy and the early results with this approach are reviewed here. The role of open radical cystectomy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical cystectomy and bladder-sparing treatments for urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of minimally-invasive radical cystectomy (with or without robotic assistance) is to reproduce the oncologic results of an open procedure, while minimizing surgical complications and postoperative recovery time. The technique continues to evolve. </p><p>Our technique uses a transperitoneal approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55963 \">figure 1</a>). The ureters are identified and divided, and a terminal ureteral biopsy is sent for frozen section analysis. The bladder is then progressively freed from surrounding structures, beginning posteriorly, proceeding laterally, and then anteriorly, including transection of the urethra. In selected men, the cystectomy may be modified to include a nerve sparing approach as with open cystectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical cystectomy and bladder-sparing treatments for urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Nerve-sparing procedures'</a>.)</p><p>High-extended bilateral pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is performed, typically up to the aortic bifurcation or origin of the inferior mesenteric artery, in a manner similar to open cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical cystectomy and bladder-sparing treatments for urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After completion of cystectomy and lymphadenectomy, urinary diversion is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1456375\"><span class=\"h2\">Robot-assisted</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Robot-assisted radical cystectomy has evolved from, and further extended, the purely laparoscopic approach and has steadily increased in popularity amongst urologists who are familiar with robotic techniques. Robotic technology aids complex laparoscopic surgery due to three-dimensional visualization and wristed, articulating instruments, which facilitate intra-corporeal suturing. Robot-assisted radical cystectomy utilization increased from 0.6 percent in 2004 to 12.8 percent in 2010, a 21-fold increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At the authors&rsquo; institution, robot-assisted radical cystectomy comprised 40 percent of all radical cystectomies in 2014.</p><p>Between 1999 and 2006, the authors performed laparoscopic radical cystectomy in 54 patients for bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of these, 17 underwent a totally laparoscopic approach for the cystectomy and urinary diversion, while 37 underwent laparoscopic cystectomy, followed by the urinary diversion procedure (ileal conduit or orthotopic neobladder) through a mini-laparotomy open incision. The lower rate of perioperative complications in the open-assisted group led us to discontinue a totally laparoscopic approach. Major complications associated with a totally laparoscopic approach include bowel leak <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine extravasation and sepsis. However, advancements in robotic technology and techniques has led to a resurgence of a purely intracorporeal minimally invasive approach to radical cystectomy</p><p>Our experience with robot-assisted radical cystectomy now exceeds 400 cases. Following robot-assisted radical cystectomy and high-extended bilateral lymphadenectomy, we now perform completely intra-corporeal urinary diversion (instead of using a mini-laparotomy). Complications rates and oncological outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy are similar to those cited for open techniques. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.) </p><p>While the most common urinary diversions performed after robotic radical cystectomy have been an ileal conduit or an ileal orthotopic neobladder, we have added robotic continent cutaneous diversions to our reconstructive armamentarium as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcomes of <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> radical cystectomy are primarily from retrospective case series. To date, four randomized trials comparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy with open radical cystectomy have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. </p><p>A randomized trial published in 2016 compared open with laparoscopic with robotic radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this study, the 30-day complication rate was higher with open surgery, but the 90-day complication rate was similar. The operating time was longer for robotic cystectomy. Each of the randomized trials comparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy with open radical cystectomy has used an open, rather than intracorporeal, approach to urinary diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In most of the randomized trials, blood loss has been significantly decreased with robot-assisted radical cystectomy; the portion of the operation associated with the most blood loss is the extirpative part of the operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].<sup> </sup>Thus, robotic surgery has demonstrated a benefit for the portion of the operation for which it was designed. Complications from a radical cystectomy are more often directly, or indirectly, related to urinary diversion. In the United States, there is an ongoing large multicenter randomized trial comparing open with robotic radical cystectomy, and the initial results from that trial are likely to become available later in 2017.</p><p>Two systematic reviews have compared robot-assisted radical cystectomy and open radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].<sup> </sup>Available data indicate that robot-assisted radical cystectomy is not inferior to open radical cystectomy with respect to oncological outcomes or other morbidity. One of the randomized trials mentioned above compared the lymph node yield for robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy as the primary endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were no significant differences in the numbers of lymph nodes obtained (19 robotic, 18 open), or secondary outcomes of overall complication rate, or length of hospital stay. Other randomized trials are underway. Several retrospective reviews have also shown that the perioperative and oncologic outcomes of <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> cystectomy appear to be at least equivalent to open surgery. However, long-term oncologic survival data are limited due to the short follow-up in most reports. </p><p>Decreased blood loss is a clear benefit of robot-assisted radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. There may also be a trend toward less in-hospital analgesia, and shorter length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, operating room time is longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6-9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,11,12</a>]. Due to the cost of the robot, disposables and annual maintenance contract, direct costs are higher for robot-assisted radical cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, there is some suggestion that lower hospital costs associated with shorter length of stay and fewer complications may compensate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. A population-based study reported that overall cost differences between robot-assisted radical cystectomy and open radical cystectomy are not different for high-volume surgeons (&gt;7 per year) and high-volume hospitals (&gt;19 per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These authors estimated that if the length of stay could be reduced to no more than seven days, which is achievable using enhanced recovery pathways, then robot-assisted radical cystectomy may be cost-effective, particularly for high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>A retrospective review from the International Robotic Cystectomy Consortium database evaluated the outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical cystectomy compared with an extracorporeal versus intracorporeal diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The intracorporeal group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of overall complications, gastrointestinal complications, and 30- and 90-day readmission rates. There were no differences in reoperation rates and operative times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Robotic-assisted techniques have improved many of the technical aspects of the procedure and have made a minimally invasive approach competitive with the open approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/6,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25-29</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study, 45 patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical cystectomy were stratified into three groups of 15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Among the patients, 61 underwent diversion using an ileal conduit, 38 received a neobladder, and one had no ureterostomy. The mean operating time, blood loss, and time to discharge were 4.6 hours, 271 mL, and 4.9 days, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study that compared 83 <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> to 104 open cystectomy procedures found lower perioperative complications rates for the robotic-assisted approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At 30 days, the overall complication rate was 59 percent in the open group and 51 percent in the robotic group. At 90 days, complication rates were 62 and 48 percent, respectively. Major complications occurred in 10 versus 30 percent of patients at 30 days in the robotic compared with open groups, respectively. Blood loss, need for transfusion, and units of blood transfused were significantly less in the robotic group. There were no significant differences in the operative time between the groups (5.25 hours open versus 6.24 hours robotic).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of data obtained from the nationwide inpatient sample (NIS) compared 1444 open and 224 robotic cystectomies. Fewer inpatient complications (49.1 versus 63.8 percent), fewer deaths (0 versus 2.5 percent), and lower parenteral nutrition use (6.4 versus 13.3 percent) were found for robotic-assisted compared with open cystectomy. The length of stay was not different between the groups. The robotic technique, however, was more costly compared with open cystectomy (+$3797) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest published randomized trial to date comparing open with robotic radical cystectomy from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, grade 2 to 5 complications were observed in 62 and 66 percent of robot-assisted radical cystectomy and open radical cystectomy patients, respectively.

Three- and six-month quality-of-life outcomes were similar in the two arms as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Oncologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival data are available for oncologic outcomes following <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. However, there appear to be no significant differences for a <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> approach compared with the open approach.</p><p>The largest experience comes from a retrospective review of the International Robotic Cystectomy Consortium database, which evaluated long-term oncologic outcomes of 702 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy with a median follow-up of 67 months (interquartile range: 18 to 84 months). Five-year disease-specific survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival was 67, 75, and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Open radical cystectomy has traditionally been performed and allows wide excision of the bladder, extended lymph node dissection, and a full range of urinary diversion procedures. A minimally-invasive approach is being performed in many centers worldwide. Reports from these sites have demonstrated the technical feasibility and safety of <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic-assisted</span> cystectomy and urinary diversion. However, there is a steep learning curve.
