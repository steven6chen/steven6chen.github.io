Kidneys receive blood through the renal arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80336 \">figure 1</a>). The blood flows into parts of the kidney called nephrons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82497 \">figure 2</a>). Each nephron is made of a glomerulus and a tubule. Each kidney contains hundreds of thousands of nephrons.</p><p>The glomeruli filter the blood, removing waste products from the blood. They also prevent some substances, such as protein, from being taken out of the blood. If the glomeruli are damaged, protein from the blood leaks into the urine.</p><p>Normally, you should have less than 150 milligrams (about 3 percent of a teaspoon) of protein in the urine per day. Having more than 150 milligrams per day is called proteinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DOES PROTEINURIA CAUSE SYMPTOMS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a small amount of proteinuria generally have no signs or symptoms. However, some patients have edema (swelling) in the face, legs, or abdomen if they lose large amounts of protein in their urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF PROTEINURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proteinuria can be divided into three categories: transient (intermittent), orthostatic (related to <span class=\"nowrap\">sitting/standing</span> or lying down), and persistent (always present).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient (intermittent) proteinuria is by far the most common form of proteinuria. Transient proteinuria usually resolves without treatment. Stresses such as fever and heavy exercise may cause transient proteinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthostatic proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthostatic proteinuria occurs when one loses protein in the urine while in an upright position but not when lying down. It occurs in 2 to 5 percent of adolescents but is unusual in people over the age of 30 years. The cause of orthostatic proteinuria is not known. Orthostatic proteinuria is not harmful, does not require treatment, and typically disappears with age.</p><p>Orthostatic proteinuria is diagnosed by obtaining a split urine collection. This requires collecting two urine samples: one while you are standing or sitting up (usually during the day) and another after you have been sleeping for several hours (eg, first thing in the morning). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Urine testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to transient and orthostatic proteinuria, persistent proteinuria occurs in people with underlying kidney disease or other medical problems. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney diseases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that affect the kidney, such as diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that cause the body to overproduce certain types of protein</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTEINURIA DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proteinuria is diagnosed by analyzing the urine (called a urinalysis), often with a dipstick test. However, dipstick testing is not very precise. Also, people should have the urine test repeated to determine whether or not the proteinuria is transient or persistent.</p><p>The urine should also be examined with a microscope to see whether there are cells, crystals, bacteria, or structures called casts. These urine elements can be signs of specific types of kidney problems (for example, diseases that injure the glomeruli). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Glomerular disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If two or more urinalyses show protein in the urine, the next step is to determine how much protein is in the urine. This can be measured from:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single urine sample collected at any time (a common and convenient method)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine that has been collected over 24 hours (a more exact but somewhat inconvenient method) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>If you have a known diagnosis of kidney disease or if you are already being treated for protein in your urine, your doctor may prefer that you collect your urine over 24 hours to determine the amount of protein in your urine.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse asks you to collect urine at home, try to keep it in a cool place, like the refrigerator. Urine is generally sterile, so it will not contaminate the food in your refrigerator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse might also ask you to have blood tests to see how well your kidneys are working (called kidney function testing). These include measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine and then calculating how well the kidneys work with a formula to determine the glomerular filtration rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might recommend a test called a kidney biopsy. During a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece of one kidney and then looks at the tissue under the microscope. The kidney biopsy is a procedure that is usually done as an outpatient and with local anesthesia. Most patients can resume regular activities the next day, except for heavy lifting and exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTEINURIA TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient and orthostatic proteinuria are not harmful conditions, and no specific treatment is needed.</p><p>Patients with persistent low-grade proteinuria that is not related to decreased kidney function or a systemic disease typically have no long-term complications, even if untreated. Many nephrologists use an antihypertensive drug, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, to reduce or eliminate proteinuria. However, patients with low-grade proteinuria should have it evaluated yearly to make sure it is not getting worse and that kidney function is stable.</p><p>In patients with persistent high-grade proteinuria who have decreased kidney function, the underlying condition is usually treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normally, protein should not be found in the urine.
