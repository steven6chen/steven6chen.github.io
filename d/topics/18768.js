The previous designation was lichen sclerosus et atrophicus; the &quot;et atrophicus&quot; was dropped because areas of thickening and hyperplasia often occur.</p><p>LS usually occurs in the anogenital region (85 to 98 percent of cases), but can develop on any skin surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Extragenital lesions are present in up to 15 percent of patients, although this may be an underestimate.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of vulvar LS will be reviewed here. Extragenital LS and LS involving the male genitalia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragenital-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragenital lichen sclerosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar LS can occur at any age but tends to have two peaks of onset: prepubertal girls and perimenopausal or postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is one of the most common conditions treated in vulvar clinics. The true prevalence is not known; estimates range from 1 in 30 older adult women to 1 in 59 women in a general gynecology practice to 1 in 300 to 1000 patients referred to dermatologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of lichen sclerosus (LS) is unknown. A number of mechanisms have been proposed based upon epidemiologic data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic factors </strong>&ndash; Familial aggregations of LS among fathers and daughters, mothers and daughters, sisters, and twins (identical and fraternal) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Trauma, injury, and sexual abuse may trigger symptoms in genetically predisposed individuals, which suggests presence of the Koebner phenomenon (ie, development of isomorphic pathologic lesions in the traumatized uninvolved skin of patients who have a cutaneous disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local factors </strong>&ndash; A study using skin grafts showed that a graft placed on the vulva developed LS, and skin with LS from the vulva became normal when grafted to the thigh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This suggests that local vulvar factors facilitate disease expression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunologic abnormality </strong>&ndash; Disorders of the immune system are more common among patients with LS, suggesting autoimmune mechanisms and immune dysregulation may be involved in the etiology of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-23</a>]. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>LS has been associated with autoimmune diseases such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, thyroid disorders, pernicious anemia, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, a few cases of concomitant LS and celiac disease have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one study of 350 women with histologically confirmed LS (of which 98 percent had vulvar disease), 22 percent had an autoimmune disorder and 42 percent had one or more autoantibodies (anti-thyroid, anti-gastric parietal cell, antinuclear, anti-smooth muscle, or antimitochondrial antibodies) with titers greater than 1:20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A separate study of 190 women with vulvar LS and 922 female controls also found an increased likelihood for autoimmune disorders among patients with vulvar LS (28 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, an increase in the prevalence of a similar panel of autoantibodies was not detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is an increased level of antibody formation against extracellular matrix protein 1 (a key component of the dermis) in up to 75 percent of women with LS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; however the relevance to disease pathogenesis requires further investigation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormonal factors </strong>&ndash; The highest incidence of LS in women is observed during low-estrogen physiologic states, such as the premenarchal child and the postmenopausal woman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], suggesting a hormonal influence on the pathogenesis of the disease. Although there may be a negative association between progesterone-only forms of contraception and LS, systematic reviews have not found evidence to support the efficacy of topical application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>, nor of hormone replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H690941636\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Androgen levels do not appear to be related to LS. An early, poorly designed study noted that patients with vulvar LS have decreased serum levels of dihydrotestosterone, free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a>, and androstenedione compared with age-matched controls without the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, many subsequent studies have been unable to confirm these findings, and testosterone is not an effective treatment for the disease. (See <a href=\"#H690941636\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection </strong>&ndash; Infectious agents (eg, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, variably acid-fast bacteria, human papillomavirus [HPV]) have been postulated to induce LS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>], but no clear relationship has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cell kinetics </strong>&ndash; An elastase-type enzyme produced by vulvar fibroblasts may lead to the destruction of connective tissue in patients with LS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Despite this destruction, there appears to be active regeneration with significant collagen synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a study of keratin differentiation markers using specific monoclonal antibodies, keratins 6 and 16 were associated with increased cell turnover in LS, consistent with a hyperproliferative state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This was confirmed in another study using flow cytometry analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The clinical significance of these findings has not been established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vulvar skin affected by LS has a wide range of proliferative capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Proliferation markers as well as the tumor-suppressor p53, are upregulated in genital LS, perhaps reflecting increased levels of oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus and soreness or irritation are the most common symptoms of vulvar LS.</p><p>Other women are asymptomatic; in these patients, LS is detected by careful inspection of the vulva for the characteristic thin, white, wrinkled skin and changes in vulvar architecture (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Signs'</a> below). For example, there may be loss of portions or all of the labia minora, and the clitoris may become buried under the fused prepuce. Although uncommon, active disease may be asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major symptoms of vulvar LS are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vulvar pruritus </strong>&ndash; Vulvar pruritus, which is the hallmark of the disease, is often so intense that it interferes with sleep. Although most women present with pruritus, some women present with pain and a small group are asymptomatic. Pruritus is not specific to LS as pruritus is a feature of most vulvar disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55449 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anal discomfort </strong>&ndash; Patients with vulvar LS may also have involvement of perianal skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62753%7EOBGYN%2F59461\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62753 graphicRef59461 \">picture 1B-C</a>). Pruritus ani, painful defecation, anal fissures, and rectal bleeding are common symptoms. In children, constipation may be a presenting symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dyspareunia </strong>&ndash; Dyspareunia and other forms of sexual dysfunction are common in women with LS and may significantly impact a patient's quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Sexual dysfunction may occur due to inflammatory disease, or as a late symptom if associated with introital stenosis, fissures, or posterior deflection of fused labial tissues at the time of intromission. Fusion over the clitoris can also cause diminished sexual sensation or even anorgasmia, although this is not common. Marked dyspareunia may occur in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with estrogen deficiency in addition to vulvar LS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A questionnaire-based study that examined patients' views of their sexual problems following the diagnosis of vulvar LS found that the majority of 45 sexually active respondents described detrimental effects on sexual function, including dyspareunia, apareunia, and difficulty achieving orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These symptoms appeared to be due to continuing inflammation and anatomic changes and scarring from long-standing active disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dysuria </strong>&ndash; Dysuria and difficulty voiding can occur, especially when there is fusion of the labia minora over the urethra with advanced disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic vulvar LS is expressed as white, atrophic papules that may coalesce into plaques; follicular plugging may be observed in early lesions. LS can also be hemorrhagic, purpuric, hyperkeratotic, bullous, eroded, or ulcerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The lesions most frequently affect the labia minora <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> labia majora (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78574%7EDERM%2F98770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78574 graphicRef98770 \">picture 1A, 1D</a>), although the whitening may extend over the perineum and around the anus in a keyhole fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62753%7EOBGYN%2F59461\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62753 graphicRef59461 \">picture 1B-C</a>). Extension onto the genitocrural folds or buttocks also may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Fissuring is frequently seen at the posterior fourchette, perianally, in the interlabial folds, or around the clitoris. The introitus may have a yellow, waxy appearance. Fordyce spots (small raised papules along the inner aspect of the labia minora, which represent normal sebaceous glands) disappear.</p><p>Scratching may result in excoriations and secondary mild lichenification (thickening of the epidermis with exaggeration of normal skin lines), often associated with edema of the labia minora and the prepuce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72766\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72766 \">picture 2</a>). Relatively minor rubbing or intercourse may lead to hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> petechiae with purpura and ecchymoses due to the fragility of the involved skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75883%7EOBGYN%2F80900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75883 graphicRef80900 \">picture 3A-B</a>).</p><p>The vulvar architecture remains intact early in the course of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60960\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60960 \">picture 4</a>). As the disease progresses, the distinction between the labia majora and minora is lost and the clitoris becomes buried under the fused prepuce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57562%7EOBGYN%2F54149%7EOBGYN%2F70014\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57562 graphicRef54149 graphicRef70014 \">picture 5A-C</a>). Shrinkage of the introitus and perineum causes dyspareunia and more fissuring upon intercourse or insertion of a speculum. At the end-stages of LS, the vulva is pallid and featureless due to midline fusion, which leaves only a posterior pinhole orifice.</p><p>Although vaginal involvement traditionally has not been considered a feature of LS, a few cases of combined vulvar and vaginal LS have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the prevalence of vaginal LS. Cervical LS does not occur.</p><p>Extragenital LS may be present in patients with vulvar LS. Extragenital lesions consist of white papules or atrophic plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79867%7EDERM%2F51592\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79867 graphicRef51592 \">picture 6A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In patients with dark skin, lesions may demonstrate hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation rather than a white color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Potential sites for extragenital LS include the thighs, breasts, wrists, shoulders, neck, back, and, rarely, the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Unlike vulvar LS, extragenital LS is usually asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragenital-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragenital lichen sclerosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vulvar LS is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical manifestations, ideally with histologic confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Evidence-based guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] from the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology state that not all cases of adult-onset vulvar LS require a confirmatory biopsy. However, a biopsy may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis, or to reevaluate the diagnosis if initial treatment fails or if malignancy is suspected. Our practice is to biopsy most adult-onset vulvar LS at the time of initial diagnosis because of the broad differential diagnosis of vulvar whitening, the possibility of underlying atypia or malignancy, and because typical histologic findings are less evident after treatment with topical corticosteroids.</p><p>In children, the diagnosis of vulvar LS is often made based upon the clinical examination only. Biopsy may be reserved for children with atypical clinical features or treatment-refractory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1469408205\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 4 mm vulvar punch biopsy typically provides sufficient tissue to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for atypical histologic features. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Associated malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519585352\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On histologic examination, the epidermis is typically thinned (accounting for the older nomenclature &quot;lichen sclerosus et atrophicus&quot;), although areas of hyperkeratosis may be observed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58841 \">picture 7</a>) and early lesions may demonstrate mild, irregular epidermal acanthosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The upper dermis exhibits homogenization of collagen with a band of lymphocytes below this region.</p><p>If LS has been present for a long period of time (especially since childhood), characteristic histologic findings may be absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This can also occur if the biopsy misses the area of active pathology or if the biopsy report indicates hyperplasia or lichen simplex chronicus, both of which are associated with lichen sclerosus, but not diagnostic of the disorder.</p><p>Clinical judgment should guide the diagnosis and treatment of LS when biopsy results are not specific. For example, when clinical signs that strongly suggest vulvar LS (eg, local pruritus plus depigmentation or loss of vulvar architecture) are present in conjunction with inconclusive biopsy results, we proceed with treatment. Clinicopathologic correlation in conjunction with a dermatopathologist can be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since disorders of the immune system are more common among patients with LS (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above), a review of systems should be performed in patients with this disease. When clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of autoimmune disease are evident, we select additional diagnostic studies based upon the suspected autoimmune disease (eg, thyroid disease, diabetes, pernicious anemia).</p><p>Clinicians must also remain alert to the possibility of coexisting bacterial or fungal infections. Investigative studies (eg, microscopy or culture) to diagnose infection should be performed if signs suggestive of vulvar or vaginal infection are present. <em>Candida</em> infection is not uncommon in vulvar LS patients who are taking estrogen and progestin preparations (eg, contraception, replacement therapy), or who are diabetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of other disorders may be confused with vulvar LS. Therefore, we recommend diagnostic biopsy in adult patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planus </strong>&ndash; LS and lichen planus share several common features and may occur together on the vulva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96570 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Both disorders produce intense itching and loss of architecture, but lichen planus usually also involves the vagina (inflammation and synechiae), whereas the vagina usually is not affected by LS. A punch biopsy is required to make the diagnosis and review by a dermatopathologist is helpful, although the histologic findings may be similar to those seen in LS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen simplex chronicus </strong>&ndash; Lichen simplex chronicus, or squamous cell hyperplasia, does not denote a specific entity, but describes a nonneoplastic morphologic alteration of vulvar skin related to chronic irritation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59195 \">picture 9</a>). The histology consists of elongation, widening of the rete ridges and irregular thickening of the Malpighian layer of rete ridges (acanthosis), hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis with a mid-dermal inflammatory infiltrate. Lichen simplex <span class=\"nowrap\">chronicus/squamous</span> cell hyperplasia is diagnosed when anatomic and clinical findings have excluded specific causes of hyperplastic epithelial changes, such as lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, lichen planus, eczema, seborrheic dermatosis, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and <em>Candida</em> infection.

The labia majora are commonly affected. Although the etiology classically has been divided into endogenous types of dermatitis (eg, seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis) and exogenous dermatitis (eg, contact irritant and allergic dermatitis), frequently the cause is multifactorial. Signs of atopic or seborrheic dermatitis are usually observed elsewhere on the skin. Dermatitis may be indistinguishable from early LS, in which case biopsy is indicated.

Much of the available evidence of the relationship between vulvar LS and SCC is based on historical studies and retrospective case series. Risk has never been defined in terms of treated versus nontreated or unrecognized disease, or to the length of time the disease has been present. Earlier detection, the introduction of potent topical glucocorticoids, the more liberal use of biopsy, and excision of abnormally thickened skin resistant to treatment may lead to a reduction in risk of SCC for women diagnosed with LS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/5,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,68</a>].

In addition, patient-reported symptom scores improved in 18 of 20 patients (90 percent) treated with clobetasol compared with only 6 of 19 patients (32 percent) treated with placebo.

In a 12-week open-label trial, 54 women with clinical or histologically confirmed diagnoses of vulvar LS were randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment or mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The medications were applied five days per week for four weeks, on alternate days for four weeks, and then twice weekly for four weeks. After 12 weeks, 89 percent of patients in both groups had responded to therapy. Additional studies will be useful for confirming whether mometasone furoate treatment is equivalent to superpotent topical corticosteroid therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Treatment regimens used for superpotent topical corticosteroid therapy vary and the ideal treatment regimen is unknown. We typically begin treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=halobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">halobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment (another superpotent topical corticosteroid). The patient applies the corticosteroid for 6 to 12 weeks as the initial course of treatment. Both once-nightly treatment regimens and tapering treatment regimens can successfully treat LS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/78-80,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80,82</a>]. An example of a tapering treatment regimen is application at night for four weeks, then every other night for four weeks, then twice weekly for four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. We prefer to use ointment formulations of topical corticosteroids because in our experience, patients sometimes find cream formulations more irritating. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ointment is applied and spread in a film over the affected area. We recommend patients use 1 Fingertip Unit (FTU) per application; 1 FTU is the amount of ointment expressed from a tube with a 5 mm nozzle, applied from the distal skin crease of the index finger to the tip (approximately 0.5 g). A 30 g tube of ointment is typically enough to last for the initial treatment period. Before the woman leaves the office, she should be shown (via a large mirror or using clinical photographs) exactly where to apply the ointment. In our experience, women begin to notice improvement in symptoms of itching and burning within the first one to two weeks of treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We reevaluate the patient after the initial 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. A good response is indicated by relief of pruritus and pain and resolution of hyperkeratosis, fissuring, and ecchymoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because symptoms often recur in women who terminate therapy, we routinely prescribe a maintenance regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/52,70,73,75,76,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,70,73,75,76,83,84</a>]. Furthermore, adherence to long-term maintenance therapy to maintain normality of skin color and texture reduces the risk of scarring, but is also associated with a reduced incidence of differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vulvar cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A prospective cohort study of 507 women with vulvar LS followed over six years compared women who reported adherence to treatment (use of maintenance corticosteroids as directed all or most of the time) versus those who reported less adherence to treatment (use of maintenance topical corticosteroids as directed some, little, or none of the time). There was a statistically significant inverse association between treatment adherence and the risk of vulvar neoplasia (0 cases among 357 women in the adherent group versus 4 differentiated VIN and 3 invasive squamous cell carcinomas among 150 women in the non-adherent group [4.7 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the maintenance phase, the patient tapers treatment with the superpotent topical corticosteroid ointment to two to three nights per week as tolerated. We reevaluate the patient after 12 weeks to ensure disease is adequately controlled with the maintenance regimen. If symptoms recur during or after tapering, the frequency of treatment is increased until there is satisfactory clinical improvement. Twice-weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate 0.1% ointment, a potent corticosteroid, has been found to be safe and effective for long-term maintenance of LS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient is unwilling to perform maintenance therapy, we examine her every three to six months because asymptomatic recurrence resulting in scarring and loss of architecture can occur over a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, evidence suggests that poor adherence to maintenance therapy may increase the risk of development of vulvar neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Some patients will achieve long-term remission without maintenance therapy, but it is impossible to predict which patients will fall into this category. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects </strong>&ndash; Potent topical corticosteroids can induce cutaneous atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae as early as two to three weeks following daily application. However, long-term follow-up of vulvar LS patients generally has not demonstrated these changes since the modified mucous membranes of the labia and clitoris are relatively resistant to the side effects of topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/77,83,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,83,86</a>]. The groin fold creases, hair bearing skin of the labia majora, and perianal skin are more prone to corticosteroid-induced skin atrophy and need to be monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Patients should be advised to use, on average, no more than one 30 g tube of superpotent topical steroid every six months once in the maintenance phase.

A superpotent topical corticosteroid is the preferred first-line therapy. Most children respond well to this therapy.</p><p>One of the largest prospective pediatric studies of outcomes from topical corticosteroid therapy for vulvar LS supports the use of superpotent topical corticosteroids in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Among 62 prepubertal girls with vulvar LS treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment daily for three months, 73 percent were completely clear of symptoms and 90 percent experienced improvement in clinical signs of vulvar LS after three months. </p><p>Similar to adults, maintenance therapy for children following induction treatment with topical corticosteroids is usually required to prevent progression or scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. A retrospective study divided a cohort of 46 prepubertal girls with vulvar LS into two groups: those that reported adherence to maintenance treatment (using topical steroids all or most of the time, 33 patients) versus those who were non-adherent (using topical corticosteroids only some or less of the time, 13 patients).

Surgical intervention is used to manage these complications. Ideally, surgery is deferred until the disease is well controlled with medication to avoid surgery-induced tissue irritation and symptom exacerbation. Surgery is not indicated for the management of uncomplicated vulvar LS.</p><p>Introital stenosis, posterior fissuring, and scarring at the fourchette can be treated by vulvoperineoplasty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79506\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79506 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">131,132</a>]. Since vaginal tissue rarely is affected by LS, part of the posterior vaginal wall is used in the repair to prevent recurrent adhesions and fissuring at the introitus. Release or excision of adhesions without vaginal advancement is seldom successful.</p><p>Adhesions burying the clitoris can result in formation of painful pseudocysts. Clitoral adhesions are released with delicate knife strokes and use of a lacrimal duct probe to free the hood from the glans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. We have had success maintaining the restored anatomy through the methods described in the next two paragraphs. </p><p>Postoperative care regimens vary among clinicians. We typically restart treatment with a potent topical corticosteroid three to four days after surgery. The patient is also asked to manually massage the area daily with a greasy emollient to separate any adhesions. Massage can be performed with fingers. Alternatively, a vaginal dilator (the largest size tolerated) can be used. Dilators should be gently inserted with a copious amount of lubricant and gradually rotated using gentle pressure for three to four minutes. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> may be beneficial for pain relief if dilation is very painful; however, it usually is not necessary.</p><p>Three weeks after surgery, the patient begins to gradually reduce the frequency of topical corticosteroid application and massage (or dilation), with the goal of reaching a maintenance regimen of twice weekly administration after an additional six weeks. Women should be warned to be vigilant about the reformation of adhesions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519584872\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The probability of improvement or remission (not cure) appears to be associated with age. In one prospective study of 83 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate for vulvar LS, complete clinical and histologic remission occurred in 45 patients (54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, no patient over age 70 years had a complete clinical and histologic remission. Relapses were common among those patients who achieved remission; 50 percent relapsed within 16 months and 84 percent relapsed within four years. </p><p>In the past, it was thought that childhood LS typically resolved spontaneously at puberty. However, it is now evident that many children may experience persistent symptoms after puberty. In a study that identified 18 adolescents and young adults with prepubertal onset of vulvar lichen sclerosus, of the 12 who were not lost to follow-up, 9 still had signs or symptoms that persisted after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-sclerosus/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p>Adult-onset vulvar LS is associated with increased risk for vulvar SCC.
