There is an increased incidence of HF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with the general population, and HF may contribute to the shortened life expectancy observed in RA. In addition to symptomatic HF, asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, defined by a reduced LV ejection fraction, is also more prevalent among patients with RA. Attempts to eliminate the risk of HF in patients with RA may significantly improve their survival.</p><p>Issues related to HF in patients with RA will be reviewed here. Other cardiac manifestations of RA and the issue of HF as a complication of targeted therapy directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are presented separately.

In a cross-sectional study that compared 226 patients with RA with 3960 members of the general population, the following observations were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV systolic dysfunction, defined as an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent on echocardiography, was significantly more common in patients with RA (5.3 versus 1.8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even after adjustment for hypertension, diabetes, and exposure to cigarette smoke, all of which were greater among the RA patients, LV systolic dysfunction was still 3.2 times more common in the RA group.</p><p/><p>In another cross-sectional study, involving 157 RA patients, the prevalence of HF with reduced EF was much lower than HF with a preserved EF (slightly over 1 percent versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies typically use Doppler echocardiography to assess diastolic heart function. The measurements usually consist of transmitral blood flow velocity in early (E) and late (A) diastole, the ratio of these velocities <span class=\"nowrap\">(E/A</span> ratio), and valve annulus velocities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, 35 RA patients and 30 healthy subjects were examined with Doppler echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Impaired right ventricular (RV) filling, an index of RV diastolic function, was noted in 34 percent of the RA patients but only 7 percent of the controls.</p><p>These echocardiographic measures are more frequently abnormal in patients with RA than in healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. As an example, a significantly higher prevalence of impaired LV diastolic relaxation was found in a group of 47 patients with RA of at least five years' duration compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls (66 versus 43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, in another cross-sectional study, the frequency of at least mild diastolic dysfunction was significantly increased in patients with RA versus age- and sex-matched controls (59 versus 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>As in the general population, the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction increases with age. While some studies suggested that RA disease duration is a risk factor that is independent of patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>], another study showed that the prevalence of HF, predominantly diastolic, was significantly related in patients with RA to both age and disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>LV hypertrophy (LVH) is a recognized cause of diastolic HF, but it is unclear whether LV mass is higher or lower in RA patients compared with controls. In a study of 89 RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease and 89 healthy matched controls who were examined echocardiographically, the prevalence of LVH was significantly greater in those with RA than in controls (18 versus 6.7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>By contrast, a study of 75 RA patients and 225 matched controls, also without clinical cardiovascular disease, found that LV mass was lower in RA patients than in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mean LV mass, measured using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for RA patients was 26 g or 18 percent lower than in controls. End diastolic volumes did not significantly differ between the two groups. When a population of 157 patients with RA and 77 matched controls (not selected for the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease) was analyzed, the echocardiographic LV mass index was significantly greater among women with RA compared with controls (95 versus 83 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> but not significantly changed in men with RA compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality due to heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RA is associated with an increased mortality rate compared with the general population.

In a longitudinal cohort of patients with RA who developed HF, the proportion with an erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) &gt;39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> was highest during the six-month period immediately preceding the new-onset HF, as compared with the proportion of patients with an ESR &gt;39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour,</span> on the average, in all other six-month intervals, both before and after the HF incidence date (23 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The proportion of patients with anemia also peaked during the six-month period after HF, consistent with an effect of inflammation. In a cross-sectional study of patients with RA, an ESR of &gt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> were each associated with an increased risk of HF (odds ratio [OR] 5.4, 95% CI 2.1-16, and 2.6, 95% CI 0.8-8.0, respectively), further supporting an association of active inflammation with HF in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is one of the major proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;, section on 'Prevention of heart failure'</a>.)</p><p>Some data suggest a higher prevalence of established risk factors for HF in patients with RA compared with the general population. These risk factors include longstanding hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, obesity, and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The following observations illustrate the range of findings with different antirheumatic drugs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit from disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) was suggested in a retrospective case control study of 41,885 RA patients that assessed DMARD use relative to the risk of hospitalization with newly diagnosed HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After adjustment for HF risk factors, the relative risk (RR) was significantly lower for current DMARD users than for nonusers (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9). The use of anti-TNF therapy was also protective (RR of 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The correlation between anti-TNF agent use and the incidence of HF was evaluated over a two-year period among 13,171 patients with RA and 2568 patients with osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The incidence of HF was significantly lower among RA patients who were receiving anti-TNF therapies (3.1 versus 3.8 percent). Although the development of HF was unrelated to anti-TNF therapy in this study, the study's design was limited by the fact that TNF treatments were not allocated on a randomized basis and by the dependence of patient reporting of HF events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A short-term study found that treatment with a TNF inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>) of patients with active RA and without clinical evidence of HF was associated with reduced levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) after 16 weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-left-ventricular-dysfunction-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The changes in NT-proBNP were significantly associated with changes in the pulse pressure, although the trend toward a reduction in the latter did not achieve significance. The clinical implications of such changes in patients with RA remain to be shown.</p><p/><p>If anti-TNF therapy has a beneficial cardiac effect in RA, it is most likely to be due to control of the inflammatory process.

The prevalence of echocardiographically determined left ventricular (LV) systolic and both left and right ventricular (RV) diastolic dysfunction is also increased in this population. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology and pathogenesis of HF in RA are not well-understood. An increased prevalence of established risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) may contribute, but RA itself appears to be an independent risk factor.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents may exacerbate existing HF, but whether they can precipitate new HF remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antirheumatic drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efforts to prevent HF in RA patients are focused on modifying traditional risk factors for HF and for ischemic heart disease, and on optimizing control of RA disease activity.

(See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Avoiding exacerbation of HF'</a> above.) We recommend NOT using high-dose anti-TNF therapy in RA patients with a history of HF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
