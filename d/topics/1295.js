In the United States, for example, there are 1.5 million regular cocaine users and approximately 353,000 regular methamphetamine users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treatment-of-stimulant-use-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Abuse of synthetic cathinones (bath salts) emerged in Europe in 2009 and spread to the United States in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treatment-of-stimulant-use-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These drugs were initially marketed in the United States as &ldquo;bath salts&rdquo; or &ldquo;plant food&rdquo; to avoid controlled-substance restrictions. The mechanism of action of cathinones is similar to that of methamphetamine. Cathinones block the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, as well as stimulate the release of dopamine.

The DSM-5 categorizes SUD severity with the specifiers mild, moderate, and severe based on the number of diagnostic criteria for SUD the patient has met over the past 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treatment-of-stimulant-use-disorder-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders#H3107677312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of substance use disorders&quot;, section on 'Assessment/Diagnosis'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; Two to three criteria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Four to five criteria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &ndash; Six or more criteria</p><p/><p>The 11 diagnostic criteria for SUD address the presence of symptoms (such as cravings or desire to cut back), behaviors (eg, recurrent or continued use despite failure to meet obligations), or physiologic factors (tolerance or withdrawal). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3664265678\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild stimulant use disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, for patients with mild stimulant use disorder, we suggest first-line treatment with individual or group drug counseling. If the patient experiences only a partial response or no response to drug counseling after three weeks, we suggest a transition to intensive outpatient therapy (IOT) rather than to other treatments. Although clinical trials of drug counseling and IOT have been insufficient to establish the efficacy of these interventions as initial treatment, in our clinical experience, they can help patients with stimulant use disorder to maintain abstinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-stimulant-use-disorder-in-adults#H1284390581\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Drug counseling'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-stimulant-use-disorder-in-adults#H78099023\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Intensive outpatient therapy'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient does not achieve sustained abstinence after an 8- to 12-week trial of IOT, treatment can be augmented with contingency management or the individual component of IOT can be replaced by cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or motivational interviewing. CBT and contingency management have been found to be efficacious for stimulant use disorder in clinical trials. Clinical trials have not found motivational interviewing to be efficacious in patients with cocaine use disorder, but more research is needed and, in our clinical experience, motivational interviewing can help some individuals with low motivation to maintain abstinence.
