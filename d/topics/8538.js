Plasma glucose concentrations may be less than 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 to 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> as much as 10 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with type 1 diabetes may suffer an average of two episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia per week, thousands of such episodes over a lifetime of diabetes, and one episode of severe, at least temporarily disabling hypoglycemia per year. Severe hypoglycemia events, the most reliable values albeit representing only a small fraction of the total hypoglycemic experience, have been reported to range from 62 to 320 episodes per 100 patient-years in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>Hypoglycemia is less frequent in type 2 diabetes than it is in type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Population-based data indicate that the overall event rate for severe hypoglycemia (requiring the assistance of another individual) in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes is approximately 30 percent of that in type 1 diabetes (35 versus 115 episodes per 100 patient-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and that event rates for hypoglycemia requiring professional emergency medical treatment range from 40 to 100 percent of those in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Over time, the frequency of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes approaches that in type 1 diabetes as patients with type 2 diabetes approach the insulin-deficient end of the spectrum of the disease and require aggressive treatment with insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1-3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5</a>]. This difference in the incidence of iatrogenic hypoglycemia (relatively high throughout the course of type 1 diabetes but progressing from relatively low to relatively high over the course of type 2 diabetes) is a function of the pathophysiology of glucose counterregulation, specifically the rate of beta cell failure and the resulting rate of alpha cell failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. The pathophysiology of glucose counterregulation is reviewed separately.

In these patients, hypoglycemia was caused by a variety of nondiabetes drugs, including alcohol, and common critical illnesses such as hepatic, renal, or cardiac failure, sepsis, or inanition. Most patients had multiple possible reasons for hypoglycemia. Only seven patients had unexplained hypoglycemia, which did not recur during the inpatient admission.

Hypoglycemia causes neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neurogenic symptoms include tremor, palpitations, and <span class=\"nowrap\">anxiety/arousal</span> (catecholamine-mediated, adrenergic) and sweating, hunger, and paresthesias (acetylcholine-mediated, cholinergic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>]. They are largely caused by sympathetic neural, rather than adrenomedullary, activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neuroglycopenic symptoms include cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, psychomotor abnormalities, and, at lower plasma glucose concentrations, seizure and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/12,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15</a>]. Although profound, prolonged hypoglycemia can cause brain death in the unobserved patient with diabetes, the vast majority of episodes are reversed after the glucose level is raised to normal and the rare fatal episodes are generally thought to be the result of ventricular arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>In the patient without diabetes, the occurrence of neuroglycopenic symptoms provides clinically compelling evidence of an underlying hypoglycemic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The character of the hypoglycemia symptoms are usually consistent from episode to episode, they may occur in the fasting or postprandial state, and the symptoms may not be recognized by the patient, even though they are evident to an observer. Many cannot describe their episodes in any detail because of amnesia, so that information should be obtained from a close family member or friend whenever possible.</p><p>Recognition of neurogenic symptoms by patients with diabetes can lead to prompt self-treatment. However, the symptoms may be absent because of hypoglycemia unawareness (which is thought to be the result of reduced sympathoadrenal [predominantly sympathetic neural] responses) to a given degree of hypoglycemia caused by recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, or sleep in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Some degree of hypoglycemia unawareness may be observed in hypoglycemic patients without diabetes.

Heart rates and systolic blood pressures are raised but not greatly. Neuroglycopenic manifestations (eg, cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, psychomotor abnormalities) are often observable. Occasionally, transient neurologic deficits occur. Permanent neurologic damage is rare and, should it occur, it would be more likely in a patient with diabetes and prolonged severe hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms of hypoglycemia normally occur at glucose levels of 50 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The lower limit of the normal fasting plasma glucose value is typically 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. In nondiabetic persons, the secretion of insulin decreases as glucose levels decline within the physiological range, and the release of counterregulatory hormones, glucagon and epinephrine, increases when the glucose concentration falls to 65 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.6 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Growth hormone and cortisol secretion also increase at similar plasma glucose concentrations. These hormonal responses begin well before the onset of symptoms of hypoglycemia. It is important to note, however, that the hypoglycemic thresholds are variable. The glycemic thresholds for these responses shift to higher plasma glucose concentrations in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and to lower plasma glucose concentrations in patients with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, such as may be caused by intensive therapy of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or an insulinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

People with diabetes should become concerned about the possibility of hypoglycemia at a self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) level or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) level &le;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. When a value is &le;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> it does not mean that patients should always self-treat. Defensive options include repeating the measurement in the near term, avoiding critical tasks such as driving, adjusting the subsequent treatment regimen, or ingesting carbohydrates.</p><p>While this value is higher than the value used to diagnose hypoglycemia in people without diabetes, it reflects the high probability that persons treated with insulin may have repeated episodes of hypoglycemia related to treatment and the importance of detecting episodes early before they become clinically severe. This value also approximates the lower limit of the physiological fasting nondiabetic range, the normal glycemic threshold for glucose counterregulatory hormone secretion, and the highest antecedent low glucose level reported to reduce sympathoadrenal responses to subsequent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This cut-off value has been debated, with some favoring a value of &lt;63 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to avoid overclassification of hypoglycemia in asymptomatic diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].

Although neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms may be highly suggestive of hypoglycemia, they cannot be ascribed to hypoglycemia with confidence unless the plasma glucose concentration is low at the same time and the symptoms are relieved when it is raised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This triad of symptoms, a low plasma glucose concentration, and relief by raising plasma glucose, was coined by Whipple in 1938 and bears his name, Whipple's triad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognize that the patient's symptoms could be caused by hypoglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Document that the patient's plasma glucose concentration is low when the symptoms are present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrate that the symptoms are relieved by correction of the hypoglycemia by administration of glucose or glucagon</p><p/><p>A hypoglycemic disorder should be diagnosed only in those in whom Whipple's triad is documented, and only those patients in whom Whipple's triad is documented require evaluation and management of hypoglycemia.</p><p>However, reliably measured, severely depressed plasma glucose concentrations (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> in the absence of symptoms should not be ignored. This may occur in patients with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia or artifactual hypoglycemia.

Thus, a patient who has a single low blood glucose value measured by a meter but no symptoms of hypoglycemia probably does not need further evaluation; on the other hand, evaluation is indicated in a patient who has repeated low values.

The latter can occur if an antiglycolytic agent (such as fluoride) is not present in the blood collection tube and processing is delayed, particularly in samples from patients with leukemia, in which the large numbers of leukocytes consume glucose, and in samples from patients with severe hemolytic disease or erythrocytosis, in which the nucleated red blood cells or erythrocytes consume glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. This problem tends to be greater if glucose is measured in serum and the blood sample is not processed quickly. Thus, reliably measured low plasma glucose concentrations should not be ignored. The measurement should be repeated using a collection tube that contains an inhibitor of glycolysis, and processing should not be delayed.</p><p>For patients with diabetes who may have asymptomatic hypoglycemia due to repeated episodes of hypoglycemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoglycemia unawareness, intermittent use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may be valuable for the detection of nocturnal hypoglycemia or patterns of hypoglycemia.

The insulin-based classification deals with pathogenesis but not cause. The latter classification is descriptive and may be useful for communicating the timing of symptoms but provides little definitive clues as to the etiology of the underlying hypoglycemia. This is because hypoglycemic disorders once thought to cause exclusively postprandial or fasting hypoglycemia have been observed in some cases to cause hypoglycemia in the alternate state. In a retrospective review of 237 patients with surgically confirmed insulinoma, 21 percent reported both fasting and postprandial symptoms and 6 percent reported only postprandial symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A classification that is more useful clinically is one based upon whether the patient appears to be ill (or is medicated) or is seemingly well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The context in which hypoglycemia occurs (ie, in a hospitalized patient versus in the outpatient setting) provides similar information. The major causes of hypoglycemia using this classification are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 1</a>).

In them, hypoglycemia, even in those with diabetes, is often multifactorial and iatrogenic.

Even in the setting of intact defenses, these drugs can cause hypoglycemia when given in sufficient doses. Among the commonly used sulfonylureas, glyburide (glibenclamide) is more often associated with hypoglycemia than glipizide or glimepiride, probably because of the longer duration of action of glyburide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Among the drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes early in its course, insulin sensitizers (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, thiazolidinediones), glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors should not cause hypoglycemia. These drugs rely on residual endogenous insulin secretion for efficacy, and insulin secretion should decrease appropriately as plasma glucose concentrations decline into the normal range. This is true even for GLP-1 receptor agonists that stimulate insulin secretion but do so largely only in a glucose-dependent fashion. They also suppress glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion. Thus, insulin levels decrease and glucagon levels increase as glucose levels fall to subthreshold concentrations. However, all of these drugs can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with administration of insulin secretagogues or insulin.

In a systematic review of 448 publications describing drug-induced hypoglycemia (excluding drugs used to treat diabetes and alcohol), 164 different drugs were associated with hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the evidence supporting the majority of the associations was judged to be of very low quality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52892 \">table 2</a>). The drugs most commonly associated with hypoglycemia were quinolones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and IGF-1.</p><p>The possible contribution of drugs in either ill or seemingly well individuals cannot be overemphasized. A thorough review of a patient's medication history is essential. Drug-induced hypoglycemia occurs more frequently in older patients with underlying renal or hepatic dysfunction and in those taking glucose lowering medications, particularly insulin or sulfonylureas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Thus, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia typically follows a several-day alcohol binge with limited ingestion of food, resulting in hepatic glycogen depletion. Ethanol may not be detectable in blood at the time of presentation. Because gluconeogenesis becomes the sole source of glucose production during prolonged hypoglycemia, alcohol can also contribute to the progression of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes. Alcohol ingestion is often the cause of, or a contributing factor to, hypoglycemia in an emergency department.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe hypoglycemia can occur during critical illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Cytokine-accelerated glucose utilization is usually matched by increased glucose production. Hypoglycemia develops when the latter fails to keep pace, perhaps because of cytokine-induced inhibition of gluconeogenesis in the setting of glycogen depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The mechanism of hypoglycemia in chronic kidney disease is less clear. It likely involves impaired gluconeogenesis, reduced renal clearance of insulin, and reduced renal glucose production. In severe liver failure, gluconeogenesis is also impaired.</p><p>In tropical countries where malaria is endemic, hypoglycemia can result from malaria, its treatment, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes/abstract/1,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31</a>].

However, it is not often found in adults in the absence of other clinical clues. Hypoglycemia is more common in infants and children with primary adrenal insufficiency, patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency caused by isolated corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency, and patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who develop adrenal insufficiency. In the latter patients, sensitivity to insulin is increased because of loss of the gluconeogenic effect of cortisol and the hyperglycemic effects of epinephrine.
