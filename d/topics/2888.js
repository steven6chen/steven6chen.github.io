However, the incidence of penile carcinoma is much higher in parts of South America, Africa, and Asia.

Our overall approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary tumor</strong> &ndash; For men with an operable primary tumor, treatment depends on whether the lesion can be adequately controlled with limited excision techniques or radiation therapy (RT) in an effort to preserve penile form, function, or both. For bulky stage T2 to T4 primary tumors, primary tumor control essentially requires amputation to achieve tumor-free margins and low rates of local recurrence. Men with a low risk of recurrence are candidates for organ-preserving treatment. In general, men with a high risk of recurrence should be treated by penile amputation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114726\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114726 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1159395689\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of the primary tumor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Regional lymph nodes</strong> &ndash; The need for surgical staging and subsequent treatment of the regional lymph nodes is based upon characteristics of the primary tumor (ie, grade, stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion) as well as the presence or absence of palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F114727\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114727 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114728\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114728 \">algorithm 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114729\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114729 \">algorithm 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H118145918\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the regional nodes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Locally advanced disease</strong> &ndash; Men with locally advanced disease (ie, unresectable primary tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bulky lymphadenopathy) should be treated initially with systemic or multimodal therapy rather than surgery or RT alone. (See <a href=\"#H133644063\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced or unresectable disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrent or metastatic disease</strong> &ndash; The approach to men with recurrent or metastatic penile carcinoma depends upon whether disease is localized and potentially curable, whether adjacent structures are involved (ie, major blood vessels, vital organs), or whether distant metastatic disease is present. (See <a href=\"#H133643934\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent or metastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159395689\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF THE PRIMARY TUMOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6182223\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors with a low risk of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary tumors with a low risk of recurrence include Tis involving shaft skin and glans penis, Ta lesions involving the glans only, and T1a and T1b lesions involving the shaft skin and glans alone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159395874\"><span class=\"h3\">Limited excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The objective of a limited excision is to preserve as much of the anatomy of the penis as possible in order to maintain penile length and sexual function while not compromising complete resection of the cancer. Minimally invasive tumors involving the glans (Tis, Ta, T1) and foreskin are most amenable to these techniques. However, small distal T2 glanular lesions can sometimes be resected with negative margins using a glans-sparing technique or with complete glans resection alone, sparing the corporal bodies. </p><p>The results with a conservative surgical procedure are illustrated by a study from the United Kingdom that analyzed outcomes among 179 patients treated over an eight-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Surgical procedures used in this series included circumcision, wide local excision with primary closure or skin graft placement, removal of the glans, or removal of the glans and distal corpora. The mean distance between the microscopic tumor and the resection margin was approximately 5 mm. At a median follow-up of 39 months (range 4 to 107), the local recurrence rate was 9 percent, with a projected five-year freedom from recurrence rate of 86 percent. Predictors of local recurrence were tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion. However, distance to the resection margin was not a significant predictor of recurrence. </p><p>Excision to negative margins is critical, but a 2 cm margin (which was historically recommended) is no longer mandated. In a study of 64 penectomy specimens, histologic grade was highly correlated with microscopic tumor extension beyond the grossly negative margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The maximum tumor extension was 5 mm for grade 1 to 2 tumors and up to 10 mm for grade 3 tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6182384\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative organ-preserving strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, alternative organ-preserving strategies should be reserved for men with small, low-stage primary (Tis, Ta, T1) penile tumors. Available options include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical therapy, laser ablation, and total glans resurfacing (TGS) are primarily used for Tis lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is sometimes used for Tis to T1 lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penile radiation therapy (RT; external beam or interstitial brachytherapy) can be used for Tis, T1, and T2 lesions &lt;4 cm.</p><p/><p>The choice of treatment approach depends upon the available local expertise and patient preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12814023\"><span class=\"h4\">Topical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (5 percent cream applied every other day for four to six weeks) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> (5 percent cream applied five days a week for four to six weeks) are used topically to treat carcinoma in situ. However, data on long-term outcomes with topical treatment are limited due to the small sample sizes in single-institution studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In one of the largest reports, 44 men received topical therapy for carcinoma in situ, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> used as first-line treatment and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> as second-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With a mean follow-up of 34 months, 31 men had a response to treatment, and in 25, it was a complete response. With a median follow-up of 34 months (range 12 to 180), 20 men remained in remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12814046\"><span class=\"h4\">Laser ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser ablation utilizes a laser energy source to penetrate and ablate the tumor. Commonly used energy sources include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG), and potassium titanyl phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Laser ablation is associated with a high rate of resumption of sexual activity and sexual satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but its use appears most successful among patients with carcinoma in situ. For men considering laser ablation, the penis must be examined after application of 5 percent acetic acid to identify premalignant areas that will require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Several retrospective series have provided information about long-term outcome after laser therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The largest series, which evaluated 104 patients treated with excision plus laser therapy, reported a higher local recurrence rate compared with that of 100 men managed with partial amputation (38 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, local control was achieved in more than 90 percent of those who experienced a local recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12814061\"><span class=\"h4\">Total glans resurfacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TGS removes the skin and lamina propria layers of the glans penis down to the corpus spongiosum, followed by placement of a skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The evidence to support its use in low-risk penile carcinoma is limited to single-institution case reports and small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. As an example, in one report, 25 men with carcinoma in situ were treated with either TGS or partial glans resurfacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. With a mean follow-up of 29 months (range 2 to 120), 24 men had excellent graft take. However, seven men (28 percent) required further surgery, and in five of these cases, it was due to incidental detection of invasive disease. However, the overall local recurrence rate was only 4 percent. Additional follow-up will be required to determine the long-term efficacy of TGS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12814071\"><span class=\"h4\">Mohs micrographic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MMS involves layer-by-layer excision of the penile lesion. It is performed in multiple sessions and provides improved precision while maximizing organ preservation. MMS is performed by a dermatologic surgeon with specific training but requires careful coordination between the MMS surgeon and the urologist to optimize patient care.</p><p>The results with MMS are illustrated by a series of 33 patients (15 with invasive lesions) who underwent 41 MMS procedures between 1988 and 2006 at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, eight patients had a local recurrence, of which seven were managed with repeat MMS. Only one patient ultimately required penectomy, and one patient died of metastatic penile cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12814079\"><span class=\"h4\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penile RT can be administered by either external beam or interstitial brachytherapy techniques. However, the rate of tumor control using external beam RT appears to be inferior to interstitial brachytherapy, as noted in a 2009 review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The most extensive experience with brachytherapy comes from a subsequent series of 201 patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the glans penis treated at a French center over a period of 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. With a median follow-up of 10.7 years, the estimated five-year local control rate was 82 percent, and the five-year overall survival rate was 79 percent. Local relapse was the initial site of recurrence in 37 cases (19 percent), and 24 of the 31 patients (77 percent) who recurred locally and received additional therapy remained in complete remission. At last follow-up, 25 patients had undergone partial surgical resection of the penis, and seven required total penectomy.</p><p>High doses of RT are generally needed to eradicate penile squamous cell carcinoma. Because of this, complications are common, including urethral mucositis, edema, and secondary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Late complications (eg, telangiectasia, dyschromia, superficial necrosis, urethral stricture, fistula formation, meatal stenosis) can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p>Prognostic factors for a poor response among patients treated with RT include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/15,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22-24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total treatment dose less than 60 Gy or use of daily fractions less than 2 Gy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protracted treatment time greater than 45 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3 or greater tumor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor larger than 4 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High tumor grade</p><p/><p>Circumcision is necessary prior to RT to ensure full exposure of the penile cancer, allow resolution of any surface infection, and prevent maceration and preputial edema. For men who undergo RT, careful follow-up is still required given the risk of local recurrence. Such recurrences may be successfully treated with surgery if diagnosed early. (See <a href=\"#H681108\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6624224\" class=\"local\">'Localized recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6182816\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors with a higher risk of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bulky T2 to T4 tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65885 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110727\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110727 \">table 2</a>) are considered to have a high risk of recurrence without adequate treatment.</p><p>Most of these patients will require penile amputation and are not candidates for a limited excision or organ preservation (see <a href=\"#H1159395886\" class=\"local\">'Penile amputation'</a> below). There are some exceptions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal, smaller, T2 to T3 tumors can be successfully treated with limited excisions as long as a tumor-free margin can be achieved.

This procedure is usually performed for distal invasive tumors in situations where resection of the tumor may leave the patient with sufficient penile length to enable micturition while standing. In addition, preservation of penile length may be possible for select men with distal tumors amenable to removal of the glans alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/2,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26-28</a>].

The urethra is brought out on the perineum as a urethrostomy in order to facilitate voiding in a sitting position. Total amputation is indicated if the tumor cannot be controlled while sparing sufficient length for the patient to stand and void. This is often the case for very large tumors extending down the shaft.</p><p/><p>Partial penectomy is performed more commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. In a review of seven surgical series, total penectomy accounted for 23 percent of 1176 procedures, with the remainder consisting of partial penectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-surgical-and-medical-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
