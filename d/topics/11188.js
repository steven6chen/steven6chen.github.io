Among these species, 10 have been isolated from humans. The species responsible for the most serious diseases are <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> (<em>V. cholerae</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">O1/O139</span> strains causing the disease cholera and other <em>V. cholerae</em> strains linked with diarrhea, wound infections, and septicemia), <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em>, and <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em>. </p><p>Four additional species (<em>Vibrio mimicus</em>, <em>Vibrio</em> <em>fluvialis</em>, <em>Vibrio furnissii</em>, <em>Vibrio alginolyticus</em>) clearly have pathogenic potential for humans but cause illness that generally is less severe. Two closely related species that were originally classified in the genus <em>Vibrio</em> but have undergone a change in name on the basis of recent taxonomic studies, <em>Grimontia hollisae</em> (formerly <em>Vibrio hollisae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and <em>Photobacterium damselae </em>subspecies <em>damselae</em> (formerly <em>Vibrio damselae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], are also established human pathogens.

A new species, <em>Vibrio metoecus</em>, within the <em>V. cholerae</em>-<em>V. mimicus</em> clade, has been identified in stool and blood samples from patients; its role as a human pathogen is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of the six minor <em>Vibrio</em> and <em>Vibrio</em>-like species that have been associated with human disease.

They can grow on standard media used for wound and blood cultures. Isolation of <em>Vibrio</em> species from stool generally requires a selective media to suppress growth of other organisms, such as thiosulfate, citrate, bile salts, and sucrose (TCBS). The laboratory should be alerted regarding cases of diarrhea in which illness due to <em>Vibrio</em> species is suspected so that the appropriate media can be used. Species identification is based on standard biochemical tests. </p><p>Certain species have particular diagnostic characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>V. mimicus</em> and <em>P. damselae</em> appear as green colonies on TCBS agar. <em>V. cholerae</em>, <em>V. alginolyticus</em>, <em>V. fluvialis</em>, and <em>V. furnissii</em> are yellow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>V. fluvialis</em> shows marked biochemical similarity to <em>Aeromonas</em> species. When the British Public Health Laboratories reviewed all of their old anaerogenic, lysine-decarboxylase-negative <em>Aeromonas</em> strains, they found that one-third were actually <em>V. fluvialis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Microbiologic identification schemes in current use in the United States will sometimes mistakenly identify <em>V. fluvialis</em> as <em>Aeromonas</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Where <em>V. fluvialis</em> is suspected, isolates should be screened for salt requirements (<em>V. fluvialis</em> grows in 6 to 7 percent sodium chloride, while <em>Aeromonas</em> generally does not) to help differentiate the two species.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>G. hollisae</em> does <strong>not</strong> grow on TCBS agar, in contrast to <em>Vibrio</em> species. Isolation is possible on blood agar or marine agar but tends to be difficult, particularly from stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22319510\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22319517\"><span class=\"h2\">Diarrheal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume repletion is the most important element of therapy in patients with diarrheal disease and is best done through the oral route with solutions that contain water, salt, and sugar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Fluid repletion'</a>.) </p><p>Although diarrhea associated with these <em>Vibrio </em>species is often mild and self-limited, antimicrobial therapy is reasonable in moderate to severe cases, particularly in <em>V. fluvialis</em> infections, given its association with blood and leukocytes in the stool. Evidence to guide antimicrobial selection when treatment is indicated is extremely limited, and antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem with substantial geographic variability. Given emerging patterns of resistance, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 g single oral dose) as initial therapy if susceptibility testing results are not yet available. Alternatives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (300 mg single oral dose) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (1 g single oral dose). Susceptibility testing should be performed to confirm susceptibility to the chosen agent. </p><p>No controlled trials of therapy of these <em>Vibrio</em> species have been performed, and there are limited observational data. In the Thai outbreak of <em>V. mimicus</em>, patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; no outcome data were reported. Successful therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> has been reported in one case of severe diarrhea and sepsis with <em>G. hollisae</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Reports of antimicrobial resistance are increasingly common among <em>Vibrio</em> species. Particular concerns have been noted for <em>V. fluvialis</em>, with the resistance patterns varying widely by geographic area. In one report from India, 24 percent of <em>V. fluvialis</em> isolates from patients with acute diarrhea harbored an NDM-1 resistance plasmid (conferring resistance to carbapenems); all of these were resistant to ciprofloxacin but susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In contrast, in a study from Nigeria, almost all strains were resistant to tetracyclines, but 100 percent were susceptible to ciprofloxacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In both of these studies, strains retained susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>. </p><p>Even though strains may show <em>in vitro</em> susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, studies with <em>V. cholerae </em>suggest that ampicillin has decreased efficacy in <em>Vibrios</em>; its use is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22319573\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data on treatment of wound infections due to these <em>Vibrio </em>species. Treatment suggestions are based upon clinical experience. Serious wound infections generally require debridement and antimicrobial therapy. Mild wound infections generally respond well to local wound care and oral antibiotics. In the case of <em>V. alginolyticus</em> infections of superficial wounds, antibiotics may not be necessary, as reflected by the report from Australia in which most cases resolved spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-vibrio-and-vibrio-like-species-associated-with-human-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Based upon antibiotic susceptibility patterns and clinical response of other <em>Vibrio</em> species, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, a fluoroquinolone, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> for severe wound infections and infections in immunocompromised hosts. Susceptibility testing should be done to confirm sensitivity to these agents. We typically use oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 500 mg twice daily, or azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg once daily. Duration of therapy is dictated by clinical response; most patients respond to five to seven days of antibiotics. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284321924\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Bloody diarrhea and fecal leukocytes are common in <em>V. fluvialis</em> infection. It is very similar biochemically to Aeromonas, with which it may be confused in the laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H631646204\" class=\"local\">'V. fluvialis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10851583\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Vibrio furnissii</em> has been associated with gastroenteritis, although its role as a pathogen remains controversial.

Infections with both are linked with exposure to marine or estuarine waters. (See <a href=\"#H631646293\" class=\"local\">'V. alginolyticus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H631646308\" class=\"local\">'Photobacterium damselae'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of these <em>Vibrio</em> species is established by isolation of the organism from the relevant clinical specimen, generally stool or wound culture. <em>Vibrio</em> species can grow on standard media for wound and blood cultures. For gastroenteritis cases, the laboratory should be alerted of the suspicion for <em>Vibrio</em>, as isolation from stool requires a selective media to suppress growth of other organisms. In contrast to <em>Vibrio</em> species, <em>G. hollisae</em> does <strong>not</strong> grow on TCBS, the standard selective media used in isolation of Vibrios from stool. It does grow on blood agar.

For patients with mild superficial wounds due to <em>V. alginolyticus</em>, we suggest initial observation without antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
