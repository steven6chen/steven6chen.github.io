Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including chest compressions and assisted ventilation, can provide transient circulatory support for the patient with cardiac arrest, the only effective approach for terminating VF is electrical defibrillation. Success with external defibrillation led to the development of an implantable defibrillator, followed in 1980 by the first automatic internal defibrillator implantation in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. FDA approval followed in 1985, initially only for secondary prevention in survivors of cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Because of its high success rate in terminating <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> rapidly, along with the results of multiple clinical trials showing improvement in survival, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is generally considered the first-line treatment option for the secondary prevention of SCD and for primary prevention in certain populations at high risk of SCD due to <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. Alternatives to ICD implantation include antiarrhythmic drugs, ablative surgery, catheter ablation, and, in selected individuals, cardiac transplantation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ELEMENTS OF THE ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ICD system is comprised of the following elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Pacing/sensing</span> electrodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defibrillation electrodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse generator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104721\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104721 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p>In contemporary transvenous ICDs, both the <span class=\"nowrap\">pace/sense</span> electrodes and the defibrillation electrodes are located on a single ventricular lead. Initially, ICD systems were implanted epicardially, requiring major surgery to affix separate shocking and sensing electrodes to the epicardial surface of the heart. Generators were typically placed in the upper abdomen. The need for epicardial electrodes and abdominal pulse generators, though, has become vanishingly rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pacing and sensing functions require a pair of electrodes. Contemporary pacemakers and defibrillators usually use leads with two electrodes on the ventricular lead: the distal electrode at the tip of the lead and a second electrode in the shape of a ring, several millimeters back from the tip (ie, true bipolar leads). These bipolar leads provide accurate sensing, with high amplitude, narrow electrograms. Some ICD leads utilize integrated bipolar sensing in which the bipole consists of a single tip electrode and the distal shocking coil electrode. In addition to improved sensing capabilities, bipolar leads reduce the risk of extraneous interference, which could lead to inappropriate device function (eg, inappropriate shocks delivered due to sensing of muscular activity).</p><p>The defibrillation function of the electrodes requires a relatively large surface area and positioning of the lead to maximize the density of current flow through the ventricular myocardium. Contemporary ICD systems use a &quot;coil&quot; of wire that extends along the ventricular lead as the primary defibrillation electrode. Thus, a single transvenous lead can accomplish all pacing, sensing, and defibrillation functions. In the past, epicardial patches were used for defibrillation, but placement required a thoracotomy.</p><p>Additional defibrillation electrodes improve defibrillation efficacy and reduce the defibrillation threshold. Most contemporary ICD systems have two or three defibrillation electrodes. Along with the distal coil in the right ventricle (RV) on the transvenous lead, some ICD leads have a second defibrillation coil proximal to the RV coil. In addition, with &quot;active can&quot; technology, the metal housing of the ICD serves as one of the shocking electrodes. This configuration requires that the pulse generator be implanted in the pectoral region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113994 \">figure 1</a>). The active can and transvenous lead systems can be combined to achieve adequate defibrillation thresholds (minimum energy required for successful defibrillation, which should generally be 10 joules less than the maximum output of the device). (See <a href=\"#H3613523668\" class=\"local\">'Defibrillation threshold testing'</a> below.)</p><p>There are three types of pacing offered by current transvenous systems. Single-chamber systems have only an RV lead. Dual-chamber systems have right atrial (RA) and RV leads. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT, also called biventricular) systems have RA, RV, and left ventricular (LV) leads, or in some patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, RV and LV leads.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse generator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulse generator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104721\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104721 \">picture 1</a>) contains the sensing circuitry as well as the high voltage capacitors and battery. While the initial pulse generators were located in the abdomen, the development of small pulse generators (eg, thickness &le;15 mm) has permitted placement in the infraclavicular region of the anterior chest wall in nearly all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The majority are placed in a prepectoral (ie, subcutaneous) position, but in some cases, a subpectoral position is advantageous. For most patients with the pulse generator in this location, the impulses generated are transmitted to the myocardium via transvenous leads. Epicardial systems are still available and may be necessary as a result of anatomical limitations to placing a transvenous lead(s). Additionally, a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) system is now available in which the pulse generator is placed overlying the left lower lateral ribs. (See <a href=\"#H859859563\" class=\"local\">'Choosing the optimal pulse generator location'</a> below.)</p><p>A pulse generator will last for five or more years in most patients, with one study suggesting that devices implanted after 2002 have significantly longer battery lives (5.6 versus 4.9 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Single-chamber ICDs implanted since 2002 had the longest battery life (mean 6.7 years). Current devices are expected to last even longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to implanting an ICD, the provider must determine the optimal position for placement of the leads and the pulse generator. Most current ICD systems utilize one or two transvenous leads placed via the axillary, subclavian, or cephalic vein, with attachment to a pulse generator in the subcutaneous tissue in the infraclavicular anterior chest wall. In more recent years, there has been a trend toward single coils rather than dual coils, which were favored earlier in the era of transvenous ICD systems. The rationale for this is that a proximal coil is rarely needed for defibrillation and that single-coil leads are less difficult to extract in the future if lead removal is necessary. An additional defibrillation lead can be placed in the azygos vein, coronary sinus, or subcutaneous tissue if necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H859859563\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing the optimal pulse generator location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern devices are small enough to be implanted in the pectoral region of the anterior chest wall, either subcutaneously or submuscularly, similar to a pacemaker implantation. Compared with abdominal implantation, transvenous devices placed in the pectoral region are associated with fewer perioperative complications, shorter procedure time, shorter hospital stays, lower hospitalization costs, and lower total costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Although implantation on the left side is preferred, a right-sided implant can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The left pectoral position is usually chosen for two reasons: defibrillation energy requirement is usually lower on the left because of the location of the heart in the left chest, and there is a small risk of arm swelling due to venous occlusion, which would impact fewer people on the left as the majority of patients are right handed. </p><p>Additionally, a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) system is available that allows for defibrillation (though no backup pacing or antitachycardia pacing) without the insertion of a transvenous lead. The pulse generator for the S-ICD system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104722 \">picture 2</a>) is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the left lateral, mid-axillary thoracic position.

RV septal lead placement is also an option. In rare cases, usually due to limitations of the venous anatomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a high risk of bacteremia and endovascular infection, the <span class=\"nowrap\">pace/sense</span> electrodes are placed on the epicardium during surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56923 \">image 1</a>). The electrodes should record a ventricular electrogram of at least 5 mV. These signals should be sufficiently large for detection of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).</p><p>Dual-chamber ICDs have an additional lead with another pair of <span class=\"nowrap\">pace/sense</span> electrodes in the right atrium for atrial sensing and pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Pacing modes'</a>.)</p><p>An S-ICD has been developed with no leads placed in the heart.

Data regarding DFT testing on the more modern single-coil systems are limited since the available cohort and registry data predate the development of single-coil systems. On average, omitting the proximal coil in a single-coil system likely increases the DFT a few joules, which usually does not impact the safety margin but could be significant in some patients.</p><p>Several studies have illustrated the impact of DFT testing at the time of ICD implantation with the current generation of devices, generally showing no significant difference in outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/18-21,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21,24,25</a>]. In the Shockless Implant Evaluation (SIMPLE) trial, a single-blind, multicenter, noninferiority study of 2500 patients receiving an initial ICD in the left pectoral region for standard primary or secondary prevention indications, patients were randomized 1:1 to either have or not have DFT testing at the time of ICD implantation and were followed for an average of 3.1 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For the composite primary outcome of arrhythmic death or failed appropriate shock, no DFT testing was identified as noninferior to DFT testing (with a trend toward superiority), as patients in the no DFT testing group had a lower incidence of the primary outcome (7 percent per year versus 8 percent per year in the DFT testing group), with no significant differences in the secondary safety outcomes noted between the two groups. Similarly, in the NORDIC ICD trial, which also randomized patients receiving a first ICD to have or not have DFT testing at the time of ICD implantation, no DFT testing was identified as noninferior to DFT testing (also with a trend toward superiority) and was also associated with a trend toward fewer procedure-related adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

When a paced impulse enters the reentrant circuit during a tachycardia, it can depolarize a segment of the circuit, leaving that segment refractory when the reentrant wave returns, thus terminating the tachycardia.</p><p>Antitachycardia pacing, or overdrive pacing, refers to the delivery of short bursts (eg, eight beats) of rapid ventricular pacing to terminate VT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114829\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef114829 \">waveform 1</a>). Although a variety of algorithms exist, antitachycardia pacing is usually programmed to be delivered at a rate that is slightly faster (eg, at a cycle length 10 to 12 percent shorter) than the rate of the detected tachycardia. Subcutaneous ICDs (S-ICDs) cannot pace for bradycardia or for antitachycardic pacing.

Because VT is an organized electrical rhythm, the delivery of an electrical shock during the vulnerable period of repolarization can cause VT to degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF). Synchronized cardioversion prevents shock delivery during the vulnerable period. Although ICDs can be programmed to deliver synchronized shocks at a range of energies up to the maximum output of the device (usually 30 to 35 joules), synchronized cardioversion can often terminate VT with relatively low energy (eg, 10 joules or less).

Because VF is not an organized rhythm, synchronized cardioversion is neither possible nor necessary. Similarly, it can be difficult to synchronize with very rapid VTs, and such rapid rhythms are unlikely to be hemodynamically tolerated.

With rare exceptions, patients should have only one transvenous or epicardial device, although the combined use of a leadless pacemaker with an S-ICD is under investigation.

The evidence of benefit is greatest in patients with left bundle branch block and a QRS duration &gt;150 milliseconds. Pacing of the LV is most frequently achieved by transvenous insertion of an electrode into a cardiac vein via the coronary sinus. Surgical placement of an epicardial lead is also an option in patients following failed efforts at transvenous lead placement, or in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for another reason.
