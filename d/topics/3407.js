It may progressively enlarge to surround and destroy the ossicles, resulting in conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss also may occur if the cholesteatoma obstructs the eustachian tube orifice, leading to middle ear effusion. Surgical therapy is required for most cholesteatomas. The extent and effectiveness of surgery depends upon the size of the cholesteatoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The most widely held theory holds that squamous inclusion cysts arise from epithelial rests in the middle ear and that failed involution leads to cholesteatoma behind the intact tympanic membrane (TM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This theory is supported by the histologic demonstration of single or multiple epidermoid formations in fetal temporal bones that typically disappear before birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Alternative theories suggest that the middle ear is seeded by squamous cells in the amniotic fluid or from bits of the outer surface of the TM following infection or microperforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retraction pocket &ndash; Acquired cholesteatomas usually arise from focal retractions of the TM. Retraction pockets are invaginations of the TM that form in patients with chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, negative middle ear pressure, and focal collapse of the TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. As the retraction pocket is progressively pulled into the middle ear space, it forms a large pouch with a narrow neck. The pouch traps desquamating cells, forming a cholesteatoma lined by the metabolically active epithelium of the TM and filled with dead keratin debris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56231 \">figure 2</a>). The metabolically active squamous epithelium has the ability to erode bone: first the delicate ossicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75737\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75737 \">picture 2</a>) and then the solid cortices of the temporal bone. The keratin debris may become infected following water exposure or a middle ear infection, resulting in chronic purulent drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76079\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76079 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1910589297\" class=\"local\">'Natural history and complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Areas of predilection for retraction pockets include old tympanostomy tube sites, the posterosuperior portion of the TM overlying the entrance to the mastoid, and the pars flaccida at the top of the TM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64096 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In a review of 172 cases of congenital cholesteatoma from a single institution, the average age at diagnosis was five years.

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>The risks of ear surgery include hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and tympanic membrane (TM) perforation, in addition to the general risks of surgery (eg, bleeding, infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/11,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Early cholesteatoma</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital &ndash; Small, congenital cholesteatomas are usually treated by middle ear exploration and simple excision. Access to the TM is either through the ear canal or via a postauricular incision, reflecting the pinna out of the way for better exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The TM is reflected downward after incision of the ear canal skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58365 \">figure 4</a>) and elevation of the top half of the tympanic annulus. Usually the TM is left attached to the end of the malleus (umbo). The cyst is detached from its mucosal connections and delivered intact. The TM is returned to its normal anatomic position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retraction pocket &ndash; Early retraction pocket cholesteatomas may be successfully treated with middle ear ventilation and mechanical reduction of the retraction pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/40,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,51-53</a>]. Tympanostomy tube placement (with or without adenoidectomy) releases the vacuum that retracts the TM. Once the middle ear is ventilated, it is often possible to mechanically reduce the pocket by removing debris and sucking the pocket out with a small Frazier ear suction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54514 \">picture 8</a>). The stretched segment of TM will return to its normal appearance, though it remains thin and will appear hypermobile on pneumatic otoscopy. It may retract again once the tube extrudes, so follow-up is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tympanostomy tube placement, postoperative care, and complications in children&quot;, section on 'Postoperative care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retraction pockets that cannot be reduced require excision and grafting of the TM. For lesions limited to the middle ear, exploration of the middle ear and microdissection of the cholesteatoma sac (matrix) is usually sufficient. Endoscopes allow access to recesses of the middle ear not normally visible with microscopy. Endoscopically assisted surgery permits thorough surgery using more limited surgical exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because the cholesteatoma sac is a retracted portion of the TM, its removal produces a hole that must be repaired, usually with the thin, strong fascia overlying the temporalis muscle. Tympanostomy tube placement (with or without adenoidectomy) at the time of grafting or at the first sign of retraction may prevent recurrent cholesteatoma formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the ossicles have been damaged by the osteolytic effects of the cholesteatoma or if it was necessary to remove a portion of the ossicles to fully expose the cholesteatoma, the ossicular chain is reconstructed using bone, cartilage, or prosthetic material. Hearing results are generally good if the stapes superstructure can be spared. Conductive hearing losses usually result if only the footplate of the stapes is left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a cholesteatoma (congenital or acquired) has extended beyond the accessible confines of the middle ear, middle ear exploration is usually inadequate to permit complete removal. To reach the temporal bone spaces above and behind the middle ear, it is necessary to remove the overlying plates of cranial bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71262 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>The pneumatized space just superior to the middle ear is called the epitympanum or attic. The attic contains the head of the malleus and the body of the incus. When cholesteatoma enters the attic, it often encircles the ossicular heads and cannot be freed, even when visualized with a microscope or angled endoscope. In such cases, the overlying bone, called the scutum, must be drilled away for access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71262 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The atticotomy should be reconstructed with cartilage from the pinna to prevent postoperative retraction of the TM.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mastoid disease &ndash; Cholesteatoma involving the mastoid is treated by mastoidectomy (the surgical removal of the mastoid cortical bone and underlying air cells to gain access to the cholesteatoma). There are several variations in surgical approach, but mastoidectomies generally are of two types: canal wall-up mastoidectomy (complete, simple, cortical mastoidectomy) and canal wall-down mastoidectomy (modified radical mastoidectomy or radical mastoidectomy). The &quot;canal&quot; part of these terms refers to the posterior portion of the external auditory canal that separates the canal from the mastoid air cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In canal wall-up surgery (closed-cavity procedures), the posterior portion of the external auditory canal is preserved. In such cases, the healed ear usually looks normal when examined with an otoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58420 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In canal wall-down surgery (open-cavity procedures), the posterior portion of the external auditory canal is sacrificed. A common cavity (mastoid bowl) is created between the ear canal and mastoid, and often the middle ear. Regular otolaryngology follow-up for cleaning of squamous debris from the mastoid bowl is required, usually for life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52515\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52515 \">picture 19</a>). Canal wall-down surgery usually includes enlargement of the soft tissue opening of the ear canal (meatoplasty) to facilitate cleaning. Cleaning of the mastoid bowl may be uncomfortable for young children. Older children and adults sometimes complain of discomfort and dizziness, even when the bowl is cleaned skillfully.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The canal wall-up approach is usually preferred when it is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. On the other hand, canal wall-down surgery is a time-tested, safe alternative for children with large cholesteatomas, destruction of the ear canal, or failure of canal wall-up surgery, and in whom regular follow-up for assessment of recurrence cannot be assured. Without regular cleaning, a foul-smelling mastoid bowl may result as accumulated squamous debris or wax becomes secondarily infected.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence is uncommon in children with small, encapsulated congenital cholesteatomas that are removed intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholesteatoma-in-children/abstract/11,32,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32,58</a>].
