It is caused by alternating contractions of antagonistic muscles. Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders, and essential tremor (ET) is the most common neurologic cause of postural or action tremor.</p><p>This topic will cover the classification, clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of ET. The treatment and prognosis of ET are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of essential tremor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other types of tremor are reviewed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tremor#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tremor&quot;, section on 'Action tremors'</a>.)</p><p>ET is referred to as familial tremor when there is a family history (see <a href=\"#H3999203040\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below). The term &quot;benign essential tremor&quot; was used in the past to distinguish ET from Parkinson disease. However, the use of &quot;benign&quot; as a modifier for ET is best omitted, since the tremor can be severe and disabling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis#H4584270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3607744139\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of ET is mostly unexplained. There appears to be a strong genetic component, at least for familial cases. In addition, the variability in age of onset, presence of sporadic cases, and incomplete concordance of ET among monozygotic twins suggest that environmental factors play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of ET suggest that ET may represent a syndrome of related disorders rather than a single disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3999203040\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family history is present in 30 to 70 percent of patients with ET, and the proportion is as high as 80 percent among those with onset at or before the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Although no genes have been identified as the cause of ET, evidence from family and linkage studies suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with reduced penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-10</a>].</p><p>ET appears to be genetically complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the FUS gene have been identified by exome sequencing as the cause of ET in a single multigenerational family with hereditary ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Different FUS mutations cause a form of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'ALS6 (FUS gene)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dominantly inherited ET has been tentatively linked to genetic loci on chromosomes 2p, 3q13, and 6p23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,13</a>]. Other families with ET are not linked to any of these loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree relatives of patients with ET have an increased risk of developing the disorder, particularly when the proband develops ET at an early age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The lack of 100 percent concordance among monozygotic twins suggests that environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Icelandic and European subjects with ET identified sequence variations in the LINGO1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], which appears to play a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation and axonal myelination. Findings from one GWAS in European subjects suggested that ET is associated with polymorphisms in the glial glutamate transporter gene (SLC1A2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In another GWAS in subjects with ET of European descent, variants in the STK32B, PPARGC1A, and CTNNA3 genes were associated with ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the study did not confirm the previously reported association of variants in LINGO1 with ET.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4255603805\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some reports suggest that the neuropathology of ET is localized in the brainstem (locus ceruleus) and cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], but the presence of cerebellar pathology is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report analyzed postmortem findings from 33 patients with ET compared with 21 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Brainstem Lewy bodies were found in 8 ET cases; in the remaining 25 ET cases with no Lewy bodies, degenerative changes in the cerebellum (Purkinje cell loss and axonal swelling) were significantly more frequent than in controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, other neuropathology studies have reported that ET is not associated with Lewy body deposits or cerebellar Purkinje cell loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study found that depletion of pigmented neurons in the locus ceruleus and cerebellar gliosis was significantly more common in 21 subjects with ET than in 21 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of 51 neuroimaging studies evaluating participants with ET noted that most studies identified functional and structural brain abnormalities in various parts of the cerebellum, but these reports lacked consistent findings that would support a conclusive topography of neurodegeneration. In addition, it was unclear whether the neuroimaging abnormalities contributed to the clinical symptoms of ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>The significance of these findings is currently uncertain, and further age-controlled neuropathologic and neuroradiologic information is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H677086984\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ET is the most common neurologic disorder that causes postural or action tremor, with an estimated prevalence worldwide of up to 5 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The incidence of ET increases with age, although it often affects young individuals, especially when it is familial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H628669739\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ET most often affects the hands and arms and can be asymmetric. It can also affect the head and voice, and uncommonly, the face, legs, and trunk. However, ET is a heterogenous disorder with considerable variability in the character of the tremor, the circumstances in which it is exacerbated, and its association with other neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. It varies from a low amplitude, high frequency postural tremor of the hands to a much larger amplitude, tremor that is activated by particular postures and actions. In most cases, the tremor frequency of ET is 6 to 12 Hz.</p><p>ET becomes immediately apparent in the arms when they are held outstretched; it typically increases at the very end of goal-directed movements such as drinking from a glass or finger-to-nose testing. Cerebellar outflow tremor should be considered when the tremor oscillations increase steadily before arriving at the target rather than at the termination of goal-directed activity, although a distinction between the two is often difficult.</p><p>Tremor in the legs is unusual in ET; a parkinsonian tremor is more likely if resting tremor is present in the legs. Tremor of the head may be vertical (&quot;yes-yes&quot;) or horizontal (&quot;no-no&quot;) and is usually associated with tremor of the hand or voice. Tremor of the head rarely occurs in isolation in ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. When it does, the possibility of cervical dystonia with dystonic head tremor should be considered. </p><p>By definition, tremor should be the only neurologic manifestation of ET. However, in some severe cases, mild gait disorder and cerebellar signs may be present. In addition, preliminary studies suggest that very mild cognitive deficits with reduced performance on tests of memory and frontal executive function may be more common in patients with ET than age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>], and that ET may be associated with an increased risk of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Some patients with ET develop enhanced physiologic tremor due to anxiety or other adrenergic mechanisms, thereby aggravating the underlying tremor. ET is typically relieved by small amounts of alcohol but, in contrast with physiologic tremor, is not usually aggravated by caffeine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2265415702\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ET is based upon clinical features. The core criteria require either a bilateral action tremor of the hands and forearms and absence of other neurologic signs, with the exception of cogwheel phenomenon without rigidity, or an isolated head tremor without dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62078 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Secondary criteria include long duration (&gt;3 years), a positive family history of ET, and a beneficial response to alcohol.</p><p>The evaluation of tremor relies on a detailed neurologic examination to identify specific features of the tremor, including its frequency, amplitude, pattern, and distribution, and to identify other neurologic findings if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Precipitating, aggravating, or relieving factors such as caffeine, alcohol, medications, exercise, fatigue, or stress should be elicited; a complete list of all medications should be reviewed to exclude the possibility of enhanced physiologic tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tremor#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tremor&quot;, section on 'Physiologic tremor'</a>.)</p><p>Family history in ET, if present, typically reflects an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.</p><p>There are no specific biomarkers or findings from neuroimaging or other ancillary investigations for confirming the diagnosis of ET, but testing may be appropriate to exclude other causes of tremor. Laboratory evaluation may include tests of thyroid function, diagnostic studies to exclude Wilson disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a>), and screening for heavy metal poisoning such as lead if any of these causes are suspected. Wilson disease should be suspected in anyone under age 40 who has tremor or other involuntary movement or posture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a>). Brain imaging can be useful in patients suspected clinically of having a structural cause for tremor, such as Wilson disease, brain trauma, stroke, or mass lesion, but otherwise is not indicated.</p><p>Striatal dopamine transporter imaging using 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission tomography (DaTscan) can reliably distinguish patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes associated with nigrostriatal degeneration (ie, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration) from patients with ET (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'DaTscan'</a>). Thus, we suggest the use of DaTscan for the following scenarios:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear after serial clinical evaluations, such as those with long standing ET who later appear to have PD because of a change in the character of the tremor but fail to respond unequivocally to levodopa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are possible candidates for deep brain stimulation but for whom the diagnosis of ET versus PD versus some other cause (eg, dystonia) is unclear and where an accurate diagnosis determines the target of deep brain stimulation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3715139944\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is a mistake to refer to any postural or action tremor as &quot;essential tremor&quot; since there is a broad differential diagnosis for tremors of this type. The main considerations in the differential diagnosis of ET are parkinsonian tremor, tremor caused by cerebellar disorders, and dystonic tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cerebellar ataxia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common differential diagnosis is with parkinsonian tremor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60694\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60694 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54735 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77497\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77497 \">table 4</a>). Differentiation from classic resting tremor should be straightforward; however, some patients with Parkinson disease (PD) also have a postural-action tremor indistinguishable from ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In fact, it is not unusual for patients with PD to present with a postural tremor shortly before they display other signs of PD. Likewise, patients with severe ET may have a rest component to their tremor. The presence of subtle bradykinesia or micrographia in early cases of parkinsonian postural tremor helps make the diagnosis of PD, although these signs may not appear until later. Conversely, older adult patients with ET may have mild bradykinesia and limb cogwheel rigidity as a nonspecific accompaniment of aging. When resting tremor involves the legs, parkinsonian tremor is strongly suspected, as resting tremor in the legs is unusual in ET.</p><p>Tremor of the entire head is more likely to be a symptom of ET, whereas tremor of the jaw or lips is more typically parkinsonian. Occasionally, head tremor occurs in relative isolation as a manifestation of ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. When it does, the possibility of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) with dystonic head tremor should be considered. Tremor of the head is common in cervical dystonia, in which it may be due either to a coincidence of the two disorders or to a manifestation of dystonic muscle spasm. To help distinguish head tremor due to ET versus cervical dystonia, patients should be examined in the supine position with the head fully supported and relaxed. In most patients with ET, the head tremor resolves in the supine position, whereas in patents with dystonic head tremor, it generally does not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Ataxia, dysmetria, proximal distribution of the tremor, or gait disorder usually suggests a cerebellar disorder rather than ET. However, mild cerebellar signs are present in some severe familial tremors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The tremor of ET is immediately apparent in the arms when they are held outstretched; it typically increases at the very end of goal-directed movements such as drinking from a glass or finger-to-nose testing. Cerebellar outflow tremor should be considered when the tremor oscillations increase steadily before arriving at the target rather than at the termination of goal-directed activity, although a distinction between the two is often difficult.</p><p>The gait is almost always normal in patients with ET, while it is characteristically narrow-based and shuffling in PD and wide-based and ataxic in cerebellar disorders. </p><p>Voice tremor rarely occurs in isolation; when it does, it is important to differentiate it from spasmodic dysphonia, a focal dystonia. Essential voice tremor produces a quavering voice best identified by asking the patient to hold a steady note such as &quot;ahhhh&quot; or &quot;eeeee&quot; unaccompanied by the hoarseness, straining, and voice breaks characteristic of spasmodic dysphonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H427775983\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Essential tremor (ET) may represent a syndrome of related disorders rather than a single disease.
