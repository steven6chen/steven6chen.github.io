They have many of the same complications, but often at higher rates, as diamniotic twin pregnancies. In particular, they are characterized by a higher risk of fetal death.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues specific to monoamniotic twin pregnancies, including conjoined twins. General aspects of twin pregnancy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3530580\"><span class=\"h1\">PLACENTA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoamniotic twin gestations have a single placenta with one amnion and one chorion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53594 \">figure 1</a>). The two separate umbilical cords typically insert close to one another (within 6 cm of each other) and are located centrally in two-thirds of cases; the other one-third is either marginal or velamentous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intertwin placental vascular anastomoses are always present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3529432\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing of postfertilization division of the zygote determines placentation in twins. Monoamniotic, monochorionic placentation occurs with division at day 8 to 12; conjoined twins result from division at or after day 13. By comparison, diamniotic twins result from division earlier in gestation (day 4 to 8: diamniotic, monochorionic placentation; day 1 to 3: diamniotic, dichorionic placentation).</p><p>The factors responsible for timing of embryo division are not known. Use of assisted reproductive techniques appears to play a role as in vitro fertilization increases the frequency of monozygotic twinning. In some studies, manipulation of the zona pellucida, which is performed with intracytoplasmic sperm injection and assisted hatching, increased the frequency of monoamniotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. Reports about atypical monoamniotic twins suggest the role of factors other than timing of fission. Mirror image twins are a subset of monoamniotic twins in which embryonic division occurs approximately on postfertilization day 9. These twins have mirror image features involving handedness and hair whorls, as examples; situs inversus of one twin has also been reported. Mirror image twinning has been attributed to division after the embryonic plate begins to lateralize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoamniotic twins comprise about 1 percent of twin pregnancies, 5 percent of monochorionic twin pregnancies, and 0.01 percent of spontaneously conceived pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>].

Among singleton births, the <span class=\"nowrap\">male/(male</span> + female) ratio is 0.51. By comparison, among monoamniotic twins, this ratio varies from 0.28 to 0.35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Two theories have been proposed to explain this observation: (1) the process of X-inactivation overlaps with the timing of monozygotic twinning and thus may directly contribute to development of monozygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>] and (2) the XX karyotype may confer a survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinicopathological diagnosis of monoamnionicity is made when twins have all of the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Same sex (a rare exception is monovular dispermic twinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single placenta that is not fused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No intertwin dividing membrane</p><p/><p>The pathologist should confirm that the amnion is continuous between the placental cord insertions. A discontinuous amnion may be a remnant of a disrupted diamniotic membrane, while absence of the amnion due to complete separation from the chorion prevents histologic differentiation between monoamniotic and diamniotic monochorionic twins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most monoamniotic twins are diagnosed prenatally by the combination of lack of visualization of an intertwin membrane, presence of one placental disk, and same-sex fetuses on ultrasound examination. Confirmation of these findings on serial ultrasound examinations improves diagnostic certainty as some findings are best identified in early pregnancy and others in later pregnancy.</p><p>Sonographic observation of cord entanglement is pathognomonic for monoamniotic twins, and may be seen as early as the late first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/11,26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26-32</a>]. The diagnosis of cord entanglement is based on visualization of intertwined umbilical cords that have different fetal heart rates upon Doppler insonation of the various vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106319\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106319 \">image 1</a>). Three-dimensional ultrasound can also aid in the diagnosis of cord entanglement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>If an ultrasound examination is performed before eight weeks of gestation, visualization of one yolk sac with two fetal poles strongly suggests monoamniotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. However, rare case reports have described visualization of two yolk sacs in monoamniotic twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>] and one yolk sac with two embryos in diamniotic twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Therefore, the number of yolk sacs in twin pregnancies does not reliably make or exclude the diagnosis of monoamniotic twins.</p><p>The amnion first becomes sonographically apparent at about 7.5 to 8 weeks when it separates from the fetal body. Transvaginal ultrasound examination at 9 to 10 weeks of gestation is the optimum method and time for evaluating the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of an intertwin membrane and its number of layers (if an intertwin membrane is present). Evaluation for the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> and number of layers of membranes between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation is almost as informative. Later in gestation, however, a thin intertwin membrane (ie, monochorionic diamniotic placentation) can be missed.</p><p>In the second and third trimesters, sex discordancy can be identified and excludes the possibility of monoamniotic twins, except in rare cases involving postzygotic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Sex concordance is not informative.</p><p>Clearly separate placentas indicate dichorionic twins, and may be visualized on ultrasound in the first trimester.

In contrast to other complications, TTTS is less common in monoamniotic twins than in diamniotic twins (2 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/17,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,46</a>] versus 9 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]). This may be due to a higher frequency of protective arterioarterial anastomoses in monoamniotic placentas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H274775756\" class=\"local\">'Screening for twin-twin transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cord entanglement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cord entanglement occurs in most, if not all, monoamniotic twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Loose cord entanglements probably begin in the first trimester, and have the potential to tighten at any time. Intermittent occlusion of umbilical blood vessels may be associated with neurologic morbidity; significant prolonged occlusion can be lethal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/50,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52-54</a>].</p><p>In a 2013 systematic review on the impact of cord entanglement on perinatal outcome, overall survival among fetuses with cord entanglement at birth was 89 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(202/228</span> fetuses), and a subanalysis found no significant difference in perinatal mortality between fetuses with versus without cord entanglement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution as the total number of deaths was small and the limited information about prenatal diagnosis and management of these pregnancies precludes making a clear conclusion about the prognosis of twins with cord entanglement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Perinatal mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatal mortality is higher in monoamniotic twins than in other twins because these pregnancies are subject to the unique complications of their twin placentation (eg, cord entanglement) plus the complications associated with all other types of twin placentation (eg, TTTS, TRAP, congenital anomalies, preterm birth).</p><p>A 2015 systematic review of studies of the natural history of monoamniotic twin pregnancies estimated that the perinatal mortality rate after 24 weeks for euploid nonanomalous fetuses without TTTS or TRAP was 4.1 percent (95% CI 1.9-6.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The low perinatal mortality rate in this review may be attributed to exclusion of pregnancies with fetal structural or chromosomal anomalies, TTTS, TRAP, or &lt;24 weeks, as well as close fetal surveillance and early delivery. Another review suggested the perinatal mortality rate was 15 percent for monoamniotic twin pregnancies after 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, these reviews do not provide useful insight about how the perinatal mortality rate is affected by fetal surveillance and early delivery or the optimum protocol for reducing risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12411040\"><span class=\"h3\">Late fetal demise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal demise is a major concern as monoamniotic twins approach term, since early delivery would prevent this occurrence and the risk for neonatal mortality is low. Data from a multicenter retrospective cohort study of monoamniotic twins showed that the prospective risk of noniatrogenic fetal death per fetus fell from 16.3 percent at 11 weeks of gestation <span class=\"nowrap\">(63/386</span> fetuses) to 1.4 percent at 28 weeks of gestation but then increased to 5.1 percent from 32 to 34 weeks of gestation; no fetal deaths occurred in the 23 pregnancies (18 with two live fetuses) that carried beyond 34<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">1/7th</sup></span> weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106095\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106095 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Although some studies have reported no fetal deaths near term and suggested that decreased room for fetal movement at advanced gestational ages decreases the risk of death from cord entanglement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>], others have observed that fetal loss continues to occur beyond 32 weeks of gestation in these pregnancies, due to cord entanglement and possibly due to acute intertwin transfusion across large intertwin anastomoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/17,18,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,61</a>]. As discussed above, these studies do not provide insight as to how the risk for fetal demise is affected by fetal surveillance and early delivery or the optimum protocol for reducing risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of congenital anomalies is higher in twins than in singletons, higher in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins, and higher in monoamniotic monochorionic twins than diamniotic monochorionic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/51,62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,62-65</a>]. Major anomalies have been reported in 7 to 28 percent of monoamniotic monochorionic twin pregnancies compared with 6 percent of diamniotic monochorionic twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/16,51,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,51,65-67</a>]. Congenital cardiac anomalies are more common in monoamniotic twins than singletons, and possibly more common than in diamniotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/17,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,68,69</a>].

The increased risk of anomalies may be related to late cleavage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> circulatory imbalances across anastomotic vessels in the placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRIC CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of monoamniotic twin pregnancy is similar to the general management of twin pregnancy described elsewhere, with some exceptions.

Standard methods for Down syndrome screening can be used (eg, assessment of cell-free DNA, maternal serum markers). For screening tests involving nuchal translucency (NT, eg, first-trimester combined test), the formula for determining the pregnancy specific aneuploidy risk uses the mean NT measurement at 11 to 13+6 weeks of gestation for the two fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Increased NT (based on standard gestational age-based tables) or &gt;20 percent discordance between NT measurements in monochorionic twins&nbsp;in the setting of a normal karyotype can be a marker for a pregnancy at risk for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency#H3372563837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic hygroma and increased nuchal translucency&quot;, section on 'Twin-to-twin transfusion'</a>). In contrast, dichorionic twins have the potential for discordant chromosomes between fetuses, thereby limiting the reliability of traditional aneuploidy screening.</p><p>Due to the complexities surrounding aneuploidy screening in monoamniotic twins, referral to a genetic counselor is recommended, if feasible. A single invasive procedure (amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling) is performed for prenatal diagnosis, when indicated. When invasive testing is performed for a positive serum or blood screening test or due to advanced maternal age, we believe standard karyotyping alone is sufficient. We order a chromosomal microarray when a diagnostic procedure is performed because of increased nuchal translucency or a structural defect in any of the fetuses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12413024\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for fetal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the increased incidence of serious anatomic malformations, which are often discordant, we perform a detailed fetal anatomic survey of both twins in all monoamniotic twin pregnancies at 18 to 20 weeks.

There were three fetal deaths among 178 inpatient-monitored pregnancies versus 21 fetal deaths among 130 outpatient-monitored pregnancies (risk of fetal death: 1.7 versus 16.1 percent per twin pregnancy). Even with intensive outpatient monitoring (eg, four times per week fetal heart rate monitoring and twice weekly ultrasound), the fetal death rate was higher than reported for inpatient monitoring (4.7 versus 8.1 percent). The authors calculated a composite number-needed-to-treat of 13 admissions to prevent one fetal death. In contrast, a subsequent French study suggested outpatient management until 36 weeks and a trial of vaginal delivery resulted in low perinatal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>In theory, one risk of inpatient management is the potential for increased iatrogenic premature delivery due to a lower threshold for intervention. Limitations of available studies are their retrospective design and relatively small sample sizes.

Monitoring and timely intervention may prevent some of these deaths. The best approach to monitoring is unclear and no approach can prevent all fetal deaths.</p><p>We obtain twice-weekly fetal heart rate tracings beginning at 24 weeks of gestation; we interpret these tracings as reactive or nonreactive for gestational age when the fetuses are sufficiently mature physiologically to exhibit reactivity. In particular, we are checking for multiple deep variable decelerations, which suggests cord compression from entanglement. For inpatients &ge;28 weeks of gestation, we monitor the fetal heart rate three times per day until a reassuring nonstress test is obtained. In the literature review described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], after weighing the overall superiority of in-patient monitoring to out-patient monitoring, the authors concluded that fetal death due to cord entanglement was not a sudden acute event in the majority of cases. Rather, they considered these to be secondary to a sub-acute event that can be prevented with sufficiently frequent monitoring in the vast majority of cases. The authors suggested a monitoring regimen of at least three times daily monitoring, either by a nonstress test or hour-long fetal heart rate strip, was reasonable based on available literature. For patients who decline inpatient monitoring, daily nonstress tests three to four times a week are offered with the understanding that this is not ideal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamniotic-twin-pregnancy-including-conjoined-twins/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Doppler velocimetry to detect altered flow has been proposed as suggestive of compression of cord vessels.

In general, these cases need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering such factors as the gestational age at which the fetal death occurred, interval between the fetal demise and diagnosis, and the status of the living twin. If the fetal death of one twin occurs before 30 weeks, we do not deliver the surviving twin because of the fetal death.

Early prenatal sonographic findings strongly suggestive of monoamniotic twins include one yolk sac with two fetal poles and no evidence of an intertwin membrane. In the second and third trimesters, the diagnosis is excluded if two placentas, an intertwin membrane, or discordant fetal sexes are noted. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk for aneuploidy in each fetus of monozygotic twin pregnancies is similar to or lower than the risk in maternal age-matched singleton pregnancies. Both twins of a monozygotic pair are either affected or unaffected, with rare exceptions. Standard methods for Down syndrome screening can be used (eg, assessment of cell-free DNA, maternal serum markers). (See <a href=\"#H12412749\" class=\"local\">'Screening for aneuploidy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major anomalies have been reported in 7 to 28 percent of monoamniotic twin pregnancies. Congenital cardiac anomalies are more common in monoamniotic twins than singletons. We suggest a fetal anatomic survey at 18 weeks. Fetal echocardiography is reasonable if cardiac views during a detailed anatomy survey are suboptimal or concerning, or the patient has standard indications for fetal echocardiograph.
