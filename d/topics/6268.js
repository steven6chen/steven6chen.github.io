In recent years, international attention has turned toward the evolving burden of drug resistance. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged in epidemic proportions in the wake of widespread HIV infection in the world's poorest populations, including sub-Saharan Africa. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first reported in 2006 but has now been documented on six continents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These trends are critically important for global health, since drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) mortality rates are high and second- and third-line agents for the treatment of drug-resistant TB are less potent and less tolerable than first-line therapies.</p><p>This topic will focus specifically on the epidemiology and clinical features of XDR-TB. Information on MDR-TB, drug-susceptible TB, and the diagnosis of tuberculosis are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Since 2007, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been defined as resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin with additional resistance to at least one fluoroquinolone and one injectable agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kanamycin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">kanamycin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capreomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capreomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p><em>M. tuberculosis</em> strains resistant to all locally tested medications have been defined as &quot;totally drug-resistant&quot; (TDR-TB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, these TDR isolates were not tested against a complete panel of second-line antituberculosis drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cycloserine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cycloserine</a>, terizidone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, the carbapenems, and the novel agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bedaquiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bedaquiline</a> and delamanid. Regardless, reports of TDR-TB raise epidemiologic concerns regarding the ability to track complex resistance patterns in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The emergence of TDR-TB also highlights the limited availability of susceptibility testing for the less commonly used antituberculosis drugs, the concern for amplified drug resistance in the face of weakly potent drug combinations, the relative inability to predict synergy or drug activity at the site of infection, and the need for optimized pharmacokinetic strategies and entirely new antituberculosis drug regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATES OF XDR-TB DRUG RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug resistance was first noted in the 1940s when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> was formally studied as monotherapy for the treatment of tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result, subsequent therapeutic interventions utilized multidrug regimens to decrease the risk of drug resistance.</p><p>Despite this strategic approach, outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) occurred throughout the world in the mid-1990s, including the United States, Spain, Italy, Argentina, and Russia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/3,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-13</a>]. During these years, in regions where HIV infection was prevalent, the epidemiology of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> mirrored the epidemic of HIV infection, since severe immunosuppression greatly increases the risk of active tuberculosis (TB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a result, the number of tuberculosis cases in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa has increased dramatically in the past decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>These outbreaks hinted at the potential for more extensive drug resistance in regions of the world with the greatest prevalence of TB and HIV coinfection and the least infrastructure to screen and manage such patients. Among patients with known pulmonary TB in 2013, approximately 480,000 were estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to have MDR-TB, of which 9 percent were estimated to have extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This figure is probably an underestimate given that the laboratory resources required to make accurate assessments of drug susceptibility are geographically restricted to resource-rich areas.</p><p>Considerable improvement in case notification has been made; 2013 estimates suggest that upward of 45 percent of the estimated MDR-TB cases were diagnosed and reported to the WHO, a tripling of case notification since 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This increase is thought to be largely due to the rollout of the GeneXpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF,</span> a rapid diagnostic assay for TB detection and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> resistance in high-burden countries (of the global TB burden, over half of all cases are from three countries: India, China, and the Russian Federation). In many regions, clinicians still rely on sputum microscopy for detection of acid-fast bacilli for diagnosis of TB, although this technique cannot distinguish between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, and laboratory resources for culture and drug susceptibility testing may not exist or may be severely limited. Referral bias may also lower the estimate of drug resistance, since patients may die before seeking medical attention or before drug-resistant TB was suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">South Africa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>International alarm first surfaced in 2006 with the detection of a large cluster of cases of XDR-TB from the rural town of Tugela Ferry in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a prospective study of enhanced surveillance, 2203 sputum specimens from 1539 individual patients with suspected TB were sent for sputum culture and drug susceptibility testing. Of 542 patients with at least one positive sample for <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, 221 (41 percent) had MDR-TB and 53 patients of this subset were confirmed to have XDR-TB. The following important observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All 44 of the 53 patients with XDR-TB who were tested were HIV infected.

Approximately 70 percent of patients died within 30 days from the time of sputum collection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two healthcare workers were among the XDR cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the patients demonstrated resistance to all of the six drugs tested at the time (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kanamycin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">kanamycin</a>).</p><p/><p>In the first five years of the epidemic, more than 400 cases of XDR-TB were reported from Tugela Ferry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and, during the height of the epidemic in 2007 to 2008, there were more reported cases of XDR-TB than MDR-TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and nosocomial transmission was identified as an important source of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Since that time, there has been a significant local decline of notified XDR-TB cases, associated with the application of expanded, comprehensive, and integrated TB and HIV treatment and prevention policies and practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nevertheless, the province of KwaZulu-Natal has continued to experience an overall rise in XDR-TB incidence (estimated at 3.5 per 100,000 persons in 2011 to 2012) reflective of the significant public health challenge to reverse a country-wide epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A study including 404 patients in KwaZulu-Natal with a diagnosis of XDR-TB between 2011 and 2014 included genotyping of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> isolates and social network analyses to describe epidemiologic linkages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Findings demonstrated that 280 patients (69 percent) with XDR-TB had not received prior treatment for MDR-TB. In addition, genotypic analysis in 386 participants demonstrated 84 percent belonged to a defined cluster. The authors concluded that the majority of cases were probably due to person-to-person transmission, rather than inadequate treatment of MDR-TB. This work demonstrates that focus on interrupting transmission (both community based and healthcare facility based) is paramount to limiting spread of complex drug-resistant TB strains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Worldwide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>XDR-TB has been reported in &gt;100 countries from all geographic regions of the world (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75814 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/1,2,17,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,17,24-27</a>]. The largest numbers of cases occur in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union. In high TB burden countries in 2016, the proportion of new cases without prior TB treatment that had at least rifampin-resistant or MDR-TB were greatest in Belarus (38 percent), Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and the Russian Federation (all 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In countries with continuous surveillance data, the proportion of notified TB cases with XDR-TB in 2016 was highest in the European region (1.19 percent) compared with the global proportion of XDR-TB (0.12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rates can vary widely within regions depending on the timing and location of surveillance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56811 \">table 1</a>). Effort for continuous surveillance (routine drug-susceptibility testing for epidemiology) and universal access to clinically oriented drug-susceptibility testing (for individual patient care) has improved but remains well short of WHO-defined targets.</p><p>In a pivotal study from 2006, a United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) task force, with assistance from the WHO, surveyed 14 supranational TB reference laboratories. Among a sample of 17,490 isolates that had been previously collected from 2000 to 2004, 20 percent were found to be MDR-TB and 2 percent were XDR-TB isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. For this survey, XDR-TB was defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to three or more second-line medications. A subsequent conference of the WHO Stop TB Task Force officially refined the definition of XDR-TB in 2007 to that referenced above; according to this later definition, an even higher prevalence of XDR-TB would have been expected. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Following the initial reports of XDR-TB in South Africa, cases have been reported in neighboring countries of Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Botswana. Data regarding the rates of drug-resistant TB from the rest of the African continent are relatively sparse, but efforts are underway at improvement as countries have completed or are planning to complete national population-based surveillance using recommended screening and diagnostic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1155906744\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a descriptive analysis of United States TB cases reported from 1993 to 2007, a total of 83 XDR-TB cases were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The majority of cases were United States born (n = 45) and 33 of the patients (40 percent) were Hispanic. The annual rates of XDR-TB declined from 18 cases in 1993 (0.07 percent of 25,107 total TB cases) to 2 cases in 2007 (0.02 percent of 13,293 total TB cases). In 2014, there were only two cases of XDR-TB reported in the United States, and since 2009 the majority have been foreign born [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The decline of reported cases coincided with the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the United States and improved public health control of TB and HIV infections. Of 40 cases reported from 1993 to 1997, 25 (63 percent) were known to be HIV infected; from 1998 to 2007, only 6 (14 percent) were known to be HIV infected. These data shed additional light on the effect of the HIV epidemic on the epidemiology of drug-resistant TB infection and emphasize the need for solid infrastructure for containment and prevention of TB.</p><p>The following clinical observations were also made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with MDR-TB cases, XDR-TB cases were more likely to have disseminated TB disease and had a prolonged time to culture conversion when treated (183 days versus 93 days for MDR-TB).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-six XDR-TB cases (35 percent) died during treatment, of whom 21 (81 percent) were known to be HIV infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was higher among XDR-TB cases than among MDR-TB cases (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.82; 95% CI 1.10-3.02) or drug-susceptible TB cases (PR 6.10; 95% CI 3.65-10.20).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DRUG RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within any given patient infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, there is a varied population of organisms, each with naturally occurring resistance to a given medication, which preexists prior to treatment. This observation mandates multidrug therapy in order to decrease the risk of drug resistance.</p><p>The mechanisms for developing drug resistance are complex and may be multifactorial in origin even within an individual patient. While it remains difficult to study whether certain lineages of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> are more virulent independent of their drug-resistance mutations, evidence has suggested that strains of lineage 2 (East Asian and Beijing sublineage) acquire resistance more rapidly than strains of Euro-American lineage due to a higher in vitro mutation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Even with introduction of a novel regimen for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), resistance to new antibiotics may be difficult to avoid, especially if infected by strains from lineage 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Patients with &quot;acquired&quot; or &quot;amplified&quot; drug resistance have had prior treatment with antituberculosis medications, while patients with &quot;primary&quot; drug resistance may have contracted a drug-resistant organism from an infectious contact.</p><p>The factors that may lead to acquired drug resistance are discussed below (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for drug resistance'</a> below). Primary drug resistance can result from:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial infection with drug-resistant TB</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous reinfection in a patient who had previous eradication of TB</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous superinfection with a drug-resistant isolate in a patient with a concurrent and more drug-susceptible isolate of TB</p><p/><p>Exogenous reinfection with TB is more common in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression than in patients with relatively intact cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A study from Tugela Ferry demonstrated exogenous reinfection of either multidrug-resistant (MDR-) or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in a cohort of 23 patients who had previously been successfully treated for drug-susceptible TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of the 15 patients who underwent testing for HIV, all were HIV infected. Reinfection was demonstrated using spoligotyping, a genetic assay that helps determine whether a patient may have a relapse of their initial infection versus acquisition of a new strain. Another report from Uzbekistan employed spoligotyping to confirm exogenous superinfection with XDR-TB occurring in four patients being treated for MDR-TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>In a large study from nine sites in Eastern Europe, the Russian Federation, South Africa, and Southeast Asia, acquired resistance while on therapy for MDR-TB was substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of 832 patients without baseline resistance to second-line drugs, 68 (8.9 percent) developed new resistance to both a fluoroquinolone and an injectable agent, thereby characterized as XDR-TB. The relative risk for acquiring XDR-TB while on MDR-TB therapy was lower at sites with Green Light Committee (GLC)-approved programs (0.27 [95% CI 0.16-0.47]). The GLC oversees a procurement mechanism for second-line drugs used to treat MDR- and XDR-TB, but programs using this service must meet criteria including a strong infrastructure for medication administration. Programs are also assisted by the GLC and participate in regular monitoring and reporting. Thus, acquired or amplified drug resistance appears preventable with a robust public health infrastructure and coordinated international effort. Furthermore, the nine-site study found the risk of acquiring drug resistance increased as the number of other susceptible drugs decreased, emphasizing the importance of early and rapid drug-susceptibility testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention and management of primary versus acquired drug resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which primary or acquired drug resistance drives MDR- and XDR-TB rates has significant implications for designing effective prevention and management strategies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In areas with a high proportion of primary drug resistance, strategies aimed at infection control to reduce transmission of TB in hospitals, clinics, and congregate sites are essential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, poor adherence or inadequate infrastructure may lead to acquired drug resistance; in this situation, strengthening and improving the performance of TB treatment programs is critically important.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2167847\"><span class=\"h3\">Geographic distribution of primary versus acquired resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The global burden of TB drug resistance is a consequence of both primary and acquired disease. The 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) report on TB drug resistance provides MDR-TB rates in newly diagnosed patients compared with those who were retreatment cases; it is a broad approximation of the regional variability between primary and acquired drug resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116433 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116434 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Previously, primary drug resistance was thought to occur in isolated outbreaks; however, large-scale national survey data has found otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In a survey of 3037 new and 892 previously treated cases from China, MDR-TB occurred in 5.7 percent (95% CI 4.5 to 7.0) and 25.6 percent (95% CI 21.5 to 29.8), respectively, and approximately 8 percent of the patients with MDR-TB had XDR-TB. Thus, a proportionally similar total number of new cases of drug resistance occurred by primary transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR DRUG RESISTANCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence and other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suboptimal adherence can lead to acquired drug resistance and clinical relapse.</p><p>Poor adherence does not necessarily reflect a patient's purposeful desire to negatively affect the efficacy of the regimen. Rather, factors related to local health systems contribute to frank prescribing errors or suboptimal dosing, treatment interruptions from medication stock shortages, or poor treatment completion due to overstressed directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS) programs.</p><p>In addition, biologic factors play a role in acquired resistance when the decreased bioavailability of antituberculosis medication occurs secondary to malabsorption and drug-drug interactions that affect metabolism and excretion. This point is particularly pertinent to HIV-infected patients. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Effect of HIV on TB drug resistance'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical trial simulations have demonstrated that approximately 1 percent of tuberculosis (TB) patients with perfect adherence would still develop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) as a result of pharmacokinetic variability alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], a rate that may be even higher when considering the development of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in a patient on a standardized MDR-TB regimen. Even in directly observed settings, adherence to second-line drug regimens for MDR- or XDR-TB can be adversely affected by perceived social stigma, isolation, and psychological intolerance of medication, which has even led to selective adherence to HIV medications over MDR- or XDR-TB medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Historical clues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain historical factors that should raise the possibility of XDR-TB have been suggested in observational studies and expert opinion but have not been formally evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living in or originating from an area with a known high MDR- or XDR-TB prevalence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous TB therapy without documented success despite adequate adherence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalization within the last two years, particularly in areas of high MDR or XDR prevalence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incarceration</p><p/><p>Other comorbidities that may predispose to drug resistance include a history of malabsorption or taking other medications with known pharmacokinetic interactions with TB therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30395729\"><span class=\"h2\">Healthcare workers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthcare workers in endemic areas are at increased risk of tuberculosis, including MDR-TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who were hospitalized for initiation of treatment for MDR-TB and XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. All patients were asked whether they were healthcare workers as part of a solicited occupational history. From 2003 to 2008, 4941 patients were hospitalized and 213 healthcare workers were diagnosed with either MDR-TB or XDR-TB. When compared with the general population, the average incidence rate ratio for TB infection was higher for healthcare workers for both MDR- and XDR-TB (fivefold and sixfold higher, respectively), while HIV infection rates were comparable between groups. Healthcare workers were less likely to report prior treatment for TB compared with other patients, suggesting nosocomial acquisition in the majority of cases.
