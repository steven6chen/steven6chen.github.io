It is one of the most common hip disorders of adolescence. Hip pain is a common presenting feature. However, approximately 15 percent of patients present with isolated thigh or knee pain. Thus, physicians must have a high degree of suspicion to prevent delay in diagnosis, which can worsen prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCFE occurs in approximately 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10,000 children and young adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The epidemiology of SCFE was defined in a multinational study of more than 1600 children and a nationwide cohort study in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The <strong>typical</strong> patient is an obese child without any other underlying risk factors who, if female, has not yet reached menarche, and if male, has not yet reached the fourth Tanner stage. The mean age of presentation is 12 years in girls and 13.5 years in boys, near the time of peak linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SCFE is bilateral in 20 to 40 percent of cases at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. In children who present with unilateral disease, the contralateral hip slips in an additional 30 to 60 percent, and in up to 100 percent of patients with underlying endocrine disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In unilateral slips, the left hip is affected somewhat more often than the right, for unknown reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Obesity is a significant risk factor in the development of idiopathic SCFE. In the multinational study described above, more than 60 percent of patients measured greater than or equal to the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile weight for age and sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Furthermore, the increased prevalence of adolescent obesity has been associated with a marked increase in the frequency of SCFE in selected regional and national populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional risk factors include renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], history of radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], endocrine abnormalities (particularly hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], and various genetic disorders (eg, Down and Rubenstein-Taybi syndromes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. When SCFE occurs in association with one of these additional risk factors, it is called <strong>atypical</strong> SCFE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Children presenting with SCFE who are younger than 10 years, older than 16 years, whose weight is &lt;50<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, or whose height is &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile for age should be considered atypical and are likely to have one of the conditions mentioned above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/14,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term SCFE is a misnomer. It is actually the portion of the proximal femur distal to the physis (growth plate) that is displaced anterolaterally and superiorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This displacement gives the appearance of posterior and inferior displacement of the epiphysis, which in fact remains in normal position in the acetabulum.</p><p>In rare cases, usually in tall, thin adolescents, the femoral neck is displaced downward and anteriorly in relation to the femoral head. In contrast to the typical varus angulation, the femoral head-neck shaft angle in these cases is widened (valgus angulation or coxa valga) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>SCFE occurs when shearing forces applied to the femoral head exceed the strength of the capital femoral physis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The classic presentation is that of an obese adolescent with a complaint of nonradiating, dull, aching pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee, and no history of preceding trauma. The pain is increased by physical activity and may be acute, chronic, or intermittent. SCFE may be classified according to its pattern of presentation, stability, or severity. These classifications are discussed below.

Acute presentation occurs in 10 to 15 percent of patients with SCFE, and often is associated with trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/5,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,37,38</a>]. Acute traumatic slips may occur following major trauma (eg, fall from height or motor vehicle accident).</p><p>Symptoms include onset of severe pain, external rotational deformity, limited range of motion of the hip, shortening, and commonly, inability to bear weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Active motion of the hip is severely limited by muscle spasm, and the patient complains of intense pain with any attempt at passive motion.</p><p>Patients with acute symptoms of SCFE are at risk of further displacement of the epiphysis. To avoid this and for pain relief, patients with an acute slip should immediately be placed on crutches, in a wheelchair or on a stretcher and remain non-weightbearing until they have received definitive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Stability'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute-on-chronic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute-on-chronic presentation occurs when a patient with a history of symptoms and signs of chronic SCFE (eg, limp and or pain of at least three weeks&rsquo; duration) presents with an acute increase in pain and loss of motion of the affected hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Patient should be made nonweightbearing as for children with acute SCFE. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic SCFE is the most common pattern of presentation. It is characterized by vague, intermittent symptoms over a protracted period, usually considered to be longer than three weeks. Metaphyseal remodeling is present, but there is no effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The classic presentation is that of an obese adolescent with a complaint of nonradiating, dull, aching pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee and no history of preceding trauma. Approximately 15 percent of patients present with isolated thigh or knee pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. SCFE is more likely to be missed at the initial visit if hip pain is absent while knee or thigh pain is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/1,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40-42</a>], so physicians must have a high degree of suspicion to prevent delay in diagnosis, which can worsen prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pain may be chronic or intermittent; it is increased by physical activity and relieved with rest (although this may take up to an hour to achieve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Patients usually have already limited their participation in strenuous or sporting activities because of discomfort.</p><p>Patients with idiopathic SCFE usually are obese. However, they may be tall and thin, indicating a rapid growth spurt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The patient usually has an altered gait. The foot on the affected side is usually turned out more than its mate. If the SCFE is unilateral, the gait may be antalgic: the patient takes a short step on the affected side to minimize weightbearing, which is painful, during the stance phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In moderate or severe unilateral slips, there may be a Trendelenburg gait: a shift of the torso over the affected hip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74735 \">picture 1</a>). The affected leg is usually held in an externally rotated position and may be shorter than the unaffected leg. If the SCFE is bilateral, the gait is usually waddling. </p><p>Disuse atrophy of the upper thigh and gluteal muscle may be present in moderate or severe slips but may be difficult to appreciate in an obese patient. </p><p>The anterior hip may be tender to palpation. In contrast, despite a complaint of pain in the knee area, localized tenderness to palpation of this area is not present. The remainder of the knee examination is normal as well.</p><p>Range of motion of the hip demonstrates decreased internal rotation, abduction, and flexion but may be painful in all directions. The degree of restriction of range of motion depends upon the severity of the slip. Although the range of motion for adduction is usually normal, it should be tested in all patients to detect the rare patient with a valgus slip (ie, coxa valga, discussed below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When the hip is passively flexed from an extended position, the thigh of the affected limb abducts and externally rotates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22,35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,35,39</a>]. This finding is highly suggestive of SCFE.</p><p>Asking the child to stand on the affected leg (the Trendelenburg test) causes a pelvic tilt (the unaffected side is lower) in children with SCFE if the gluteal muscle has inhibited by the pain of a chronic SCFE.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coxa valga slips &ndash; Coxa valga is a rare type of slip in which the femoral neck is displaced downward and anteriorly in relation to the femoral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,44</a>]. Similar to patients with varus slips, patients with coxa valga typically complain of anteromedial thigh or knee pain and limited hip flexion on the affected side. However, they have lengthening, rather than shortening, of the affected limb (which leads to a circumduction) and limited range of motion in adduction, rather than abduction. Lateral radiographs are necessary for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCFE also has been classified according to biomechanical stability as &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stable slips</strong> &ndash; Stable slips are defined as those in which walking and weightbearing are possible with or without crutches. Nevertheless, patients with &ldquo;stable&rdquo; slips should be made nonweightbearing until orthopedic consultation and treatment have occurred. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unstable slips </strong>&ndash; Unstable slips are those in which the epiphysis is displaced from the metaphysis or the patient is unable to bear weight, even with crutches, regardless of duration of symptoms. Most of these patients present with severe pain similar to a fracture of the hip. However, patients with unstable slips may have forewarning symptoms. As an example, in an observational study of 82 children, 88 percent of patients had pain in their hips, thighs, or knees for an average of 42 days before sustaining unstable SCFE&rsquo;s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because manipulation may cause further displacement of the epiphysis, patients who have unstable slips should immediately be placed in a wheelchair or on a stretcher and remain non-weightbearing until they have received definitive treatment.

The minimum radiographic examination consists of an anteroposterior (AP) view and lateral projections of both hips. The lateral projections are obtained by the frog-leg or cross-table lateral views; true lateral hip radiographs instead of frog-leg lateral should be obtained in patients with acute onset of symptoms and probable unstable SCFE because of the potential risk of further displacement of the epiphysis with frog-leg views in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Bilateral views or pelvis views are obtained to permit comparison, which may facilitate identification of subtle findings, and because of the high incidence of bilateral disease.

In as many as 25 percent of patients whose SCFEs are missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], radiographs were misinterpreted, or the diagnosis could not be established with the radiographs that were obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Findings of SCFE on AP and lateral projections include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>AP view &ndash;</strong> On the AP view, there may be mild widening, lucency, and irregularity of the physis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The most reliable sign of an early slip may be blurring of the junction between the metaphysis and the growth plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55393 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The height of the epiphysis may be diminished because the femoral head has rotated posteriorly. With posterior slippage of the femoral head, the portion of the head that is located behind the metaphysis may be projected as a semicircular area of increased density on the proximal part of the femoral neck; this is called the &quot;blanch sign of Steel&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58172 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the normal AP view, a line drawn along the superior femoral neck (Klein's line) intersects the lateral portion of the femoral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In a patient with SCFE, the line passes outside of the epiphysis or just at its superior edge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82443 \">figure 5</a>). Also, there may be a smaller portion of the femoral head above the line compared with the contralateral hip (assuming the opposite hip is normal). Although Klein&rsquo;s line is a useful tool for identifying SCFE on the AP view, relying solely on it will fail to identify many slips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. A modification of Klein&rsquo;s line involves measuring the width of the epiphysis lateral to Klein&rsquo;s line to improve sensitivity. Using this modified Klein&rsquo;s line, a clinician should consider the diagnosis of SCFE if the epiphyseal width lateral to Klein&rsquo;s line differs by 2 mm or more between hips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lateral view</strong> &ndash; Lateral projections (either frog-leg views or cross-table lateral views) are necessary to make the diagnosis in many cases and should always be obtained when evaluating a patient for SCFE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/54,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56-58</a>]. The posterior displacement and step-off of the epiphysis on the femoral neck are better demonstrated on the lateral view. The cross-table view is recommended in patients who have acute onset of symptoms, since the flexion and abduction of the hip that is necessary for the frog-leg view may displace the physis in these unstable slips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The use of crutches or a wheelchair and bed rest is strongly recommended to prevent further slippage as demonstrated by the following image (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82320\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82320 \">image 3</a>). </p><p>The operative goals are stabilization of the diseased physis to prevent further slippage and avoidance of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The gold standard for stabilization of <span class=\"nowrap\">chronic/stable</span> slips, regardless of severity, is the use of a single cannulated screw placed in the center of the epiphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] although use of growing implants has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Stabilization usually involves pinning in situ (ie, without attempt at reduction) because manipulation has been found to correlate with a poorer long-term prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/39,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,71</a>].

Closed reduction of an acute slip before pinning is controversial. Screw fixation is the most commonly used and widely accepted treatment for SCFE.

Close follow-up should continue until the child has finished growing. In addition, patients and parents should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms of SCFE (eg, nonradiating, dull, aching pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684392471\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative management usually includes a period of limited weightbearing with crutches or a walker. In bilateral cases, patients are taught to use a four-point gait (eg, the right crutch followed by the left leg, followed by the left crutch, followed by the right leg, etc). After six to eight weeks, crutches are discontinued, and regular activities are gradually resumed. Return to sports participation depends upon the residual limitation of motion, since most patients lose internal hip rotation.</p><p>In selected cases with severe deformity, reconstructive surgery can be considered. A number of proximal femoral osteotomies have been proposed to correct excessive hip varus and extension.

SCFE patients who develop or are suspected to have osteonecrosis should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Chondrolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chondrolysis, or narrowing of the joint space and loss of articular cartilage, can occur with an untreated SCFE or develop postoperatively. It is present in up to 7 percent of cases even before treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. It is more common among girls than boys and is particularly common among black girls, having occurred in 51 percent of black females in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. It also is more common among patients with prolonged immobilization and in whom the stabilizing pins penetrate into the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of chondrolysis include pain and flexion deformity of the hip, with restricted range of motion in all planes. Radiographs show regional osteoporosis, followed by narrowing of the articular cartilage. MRI demonstrates narrowing of the joint space and irregularity of the articular cartilage. Changes on bone scan (decreased activity in the physis) may precede changes on plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>The course varies from spontaneous resolution to partial recovery to rapid destruction of the articular cartilage with fibrosis and ankylosis of the hip joint. SCFE patients who develop or are suspected of having chondrolysis should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175197738\"><span class=\"h2\">Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoroacetabular impingement is an abnormal contact between the proximal femoral metaphysis and the acetabular rim. It is believed to be caused by residual abnormal morphology with prominence of the femoral metaphysis abutting the acetabular rim. SCFE is one of the most frequent underlying causes for FAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. This may be symptomatic and leads to the premature development of osteoarthritis of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. In this instance, grade of slip is not a predictive tool for the development of FAI, as even mild slips are at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Several surgical techniques are proposed to address potential FAI by restoring the anatomy of the proximal femur or correcting healed SCFE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/105-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-108</a>]. However, evidence is lacking to suggest one approach over another. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of SCFE is related to the severity of slip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68411 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/37,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,71</a>]. Mild slips are usually well tolerated. However, patients with a history of SCFE (even mild) are at increased risk for premature development of osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>], and unrecognized SCFE is thought to be a common cause of osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. In patients without complications, osteoarthritis of the hip usually develops over a course of decades. The rate of osteoarthritis at 20- to 40-year follow-up and the incidence of osteonecrosis and chondrolysis increase with increasing severity of slip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68411 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Femoroacetabular impingement and the development of osteoarthritis are not related to severity of the slip because even mild slips are at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. </p><p>Regardless of severity of slip, reconstructive arthroplasty for degenerative changes may be needed for persistent symptoms. As an example, in an observational study of 146 patients with SCFE who underwent in situ pinning and had follow-up 2 to 43 years later, reconstructive surgery was needed for persistent symptoms, primarily pain, stiffness and functional limitation, in 12 percent of patients including patients with mild, moderate, or severe slips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Of patients not undergoing reconstructive surgery, approximately one-third had persistent mild pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCFE is characterized by a displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck through the physeal plate. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean age of presentation is 12 years in girls and 13.5 years in boys, near the time of peak linear growth. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1. Obesity is a significant risk factor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most common features of the presentation of SCFE are pain and altered gait. The classic presentation is that of an obese adolescent with a complaint of nonradiating, dull, aching pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee, and no history of preceding trauma. The pain is increased by physical activity and may be chronic or intermittent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCFE is traditionally classified into four patterns of presentation on the basis of intensity and duration of symptoms: preslip, acute, acute-on-chronic, and chronic. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Presentation patterns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SCFE is usually made on plain radiographs, which reveal an apparent posterior displacement of the femoral epiphysis, like ice cream slipping off a cone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59157\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59157 \">image 1</a>). The earliest plain radiographic changes are widening and irregularity of the physis, with thinning of the proximal epiphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55393 \">figure 3</a>). These changes are best seen on lateral views. If the radiograph is normal but suspicion for early SCFE is high, MRI may demonstrate widening of the physis with surrounding edema, essentially diagnostic of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of SCFE is operative. Children with SCFE, regardless of classification, should be referred promptly to an orthopedic surgeon; they must avoid bearing weight until they have undergone orthopedic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 30 to 60 percent of patients with unilateral SCFE at presentation eventually have SCFE in the contralateral hip. To prevent delay in diagnosis of the second slip, all patients with unilateral involvement who do not undergo prophylactic repair of the contralateral hip should be followed closely by an orthopedic surgeon until after the child has finished growing. Patients and parents should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms of SCFE (eg, nonradiating, dull, aching pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complications of SCFE include osteonecrosis of the femoral head, femoroacetabular impingement, and chondrolysis. All of these conditions increase the risk of subsequent development of osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of SCFE is related to the etiology and severity of the slip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68411 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcome'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kocher MS, Bishop JA, Weed B, et al.
