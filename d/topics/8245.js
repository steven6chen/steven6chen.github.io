Everyone has some. It is needed for good health. The problem is, people sometimes have too much cholesterol. Compared with people with normal cholesterol, people with high cholesterol have a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other health problems. The higher your cholesterol, the higher your risk of these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25074017\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of cholesterol?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are a few different types. If you get a cholesterol test, you might hear your doctor or nurse talk about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL cholesterol &ndash; Some people call this the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. That's because having high LDL levels <strong>raises</strong> your risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDL cholesterol &ndash; Some people call this the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol. That's because people with high HDL levels tend to have a <strong>lower</strong> risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other health problems. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-HDL cholesterol &ndash; Non-HDL cholesterol is your total cholesterol minus your HDL cholesterol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triglycerides &ndash; Triglycerides are not cholesterol. They are another type of fat. But they often get measured when cholesterol is measured. (Having high triglycerides also seems to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25074024\"><span class=\"h1\">What should my numbers be?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse what your numbers should be. Different people need different goals. (If you live outside the United States, see the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76734 \">table 1</a>)). In general, people who do not already have heart disease should aim for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total cholesterol below 200</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL cholesterol below 130 &ndash; or much lower, if they are at risk of heart attacks or strokes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDL cholesterol above 60</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-HDL cholesterol below 160 &ndash; or lower, if they are at risk of heart attacks or strokes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triglycerides below 150</p><p/><p>Keep in mind, though, that many people who cannot meet these goals still have a low risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25074031\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if my doctor tells me I have high cholesterol?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor what your <strong>overall</strong> risk of heart attacks and strokes is. High cholesterol, by itself, is not always a reason to worry. Having high cholesterol is just one of many things that can increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Other factors that increase your risk include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a parent, sister, or brother who got heart disease at a young age &ndash; Young, in this case, means younger than 55 for men and younger than 65 for women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diet that is not heart healthy &ndash; A &quot;heart-healthy&quot; diet includes lots of fruits and vegetables, fiber, and healthy fats (like those found in fish and certain oils). It also means limiting sugar and unhealthy fats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p/><p>If you are at high risk of heart attacks and strokes, having high cholesterol is a problem. On the other hand, if you are at low risk, having high cholesterol might not lead to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25074038\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take medicine to lower cholesterol?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not everyone who has high cholesterol needs medicines. Your doctor or nurse will decide if you need them based on your age, family history, and other health concerns.</p><p>You should probably take a cholesterol-lowering medicine called a statin if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Already had a heart attack or stroke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have known heart disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diabetes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a condition called peripheral artery disease, which makes it painful to walk, and happens when the arteries in your legs get clogged with fatty deposits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a widening of the main artery in the belly</p><p/><p>Most people with any of the conditions listed above should take a statin no matter what their cholesterol level is. If your doctor or nurse puts you on a statin, stay on it. The medicine might not make you feel any different. But it can help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25074045\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I lower my cholesterol without medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you can lower your cholesterol some by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding red meat, butter, fried foods, cheese, and other foods that have a lot of saturated fat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight (if you are overweight)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more active</p><p/><p>Even if these steps do little to change your cholesterol, they can improve your health in many ways.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25074136\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Familial hypercholesterolemia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atherosclerosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atherosclerosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-triglycerides-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High triglycerides (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=can-foods-or-supplements-lower-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Can foods or supplements lower cholesterol?
