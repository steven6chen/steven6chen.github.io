Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including chest compressions and assisted ventilation, can provide transient circulatory support for the patient with SCA, the only effective approach for terminating pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) is electrical defibrillation. Success with external defibrillation led to the development of an implantable defibrillator in the mid-1960s. It was not until 1980 that the first automatic internal defibrillator was implanted in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of its high success rate in terminating VF rapidly, along with the results of multiple clinical trials showing improvement in survival, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is generally considered the first-line treatment option for the secondary prevention of SCD and for primary prevention in certain populations at high risk of SCD due to <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. Alternatives to ICD implantation include antiarrhythmic drugs, ablative surgery, catheter ablation, and, in rare individuals, cardiac transplantation.

When recommending ICD programming settings, we are often guided in our general approach by randomized trials. However, specific patient circumstances may mandate a different approach from that of generic programming recommendations. In particular, evidence for ICD programming is often gleaned from adult populations, and direct translation to pediatric patients may not always be appropriate; this is particularly pertinent for rate cutoff settings in children, teenagers, and young adults. Thus, programming guidelines are simply that: guidelines. They are not always applicable to every patient, and care must be taken to tailor therapy to the individual. Fortunately, most patients do not have such specific requirements, and an empiric approach to programming is reasonable for the majority.</p><p>Readers who wish for a more comprehensive overview on ICD programming are directed to the 2015 <span class=\"nowrap\">HRS/EHRA/APHRS/SOLAECE</span> Expert Consensus Statement on Optimal Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Programming and Testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3944481201\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of ICD programming and therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As ICD technology has evolved, the number and variety of available programming and therapeutic options have dramatically increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Contemporary ICDs have a variety of flexible programming and therapeutic options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bradycardia settings</strong> &ndash; While ICDs are implanted for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias, patients occasionally have a need for bradycardia support also. In addition, the pacemaker settings of an ICD may influence patient outcome even when an indication for bradycardia pacing does not exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A general principle of ICD bradycardia pacing settings is to <strong>minimize the percentage of right ventricular pacing</strong>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cardiac pacing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac resynchronization therapy</strong> <strong>(CRT)</strong> &ndash; The indications for ICD implantation and CRT overlap to a degree. A general principle of ICD bradycardia pacing settings in patients with CRT-defibrillators is to <strong>maximize the percentage of biventricular pacing</strong>. A detailed discussion of CRT devices is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arrhythmia detection</strong> &ndash; At their most basic, ICDs detect arrhythmias based on duration criteria (an arrhythmia must be of sufficient length to be significant) and rate criteria (an arrhythmia must exceed a programmed rate cutoff to be significant). Therefore, an episode must be both sufficiently long and sufficiently rapid to trigger therapy. Recommendations for rate criteria and duration have evolved over time and are further refined by the addition of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) discriminators and algorithms to reduce detection of noise (both physiological and nonphysiological sources of noise).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arrhythmia discrimination</strong> &ndash; The ability to distinguish arrhythmias requiring ICD therapy from other heart rhythms is crucial to appropriate ICD function. ICDs can be programmed to assess heart rate, suddenness of onset, atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, interval stability, QRS templates, and other parameters to help identify ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Noise discrimination</strong> &ndash; Algorithms to avoid signal noise being detected as an arrhythmia have evolved over time. These aim to prevent physiological noise (eg, T-wave oversensing) and nonphysiological noise (eg, electromagnetic interference) from being falsely detected as ventricular arrhythmia and triggering inappropriate therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic device interactions with electromagnetic fields in the non-hospital environment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple available therapies</strong> &ndash; ICDs can treat ventricular tachyarrhythmias with antitachycardia pacing (ATP) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shocks. These therapies have parameters that can be varied and adjusted (eg, the number, rate, and duration of ATP cycles and the delivered energy for cardioversion and defibrillation). In each therapy zone, a sequence of therapies (ATP, cardioversion, or defibrillation) can be delivered. After each therapy, the device reevaluates the rhythm, and if the tachyarrhythmia persists, the next therapy is delivered. These therapies are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1764413667\" class=\"local\">'Tachycardia therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple zones</strong> &ndash; ICDs can be programmed to provide different therapies to tachyarrhythmias in up to three heart rate zones. The rationale for this approach is that relatively slow ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, ventricular tachycardia [VT] with a heart rate &lt;180 beats per minute) may not lead to loss of consciousness or other unstable symptoms for at least several minutes. Additionally, VT can often be terminated with ATP, which can be delivered quickly and with no pain and minimal battery drainage. By contrast, faster VTs (eg, heart rate &gt;250 beats per minute) are more likely to be unstable and poorly tolerated; they can require high-energy defibrillation and can become increasingly difficult to terminate if definitive therapy is delayed. Thus, the most successful approach for such fast VTs is high-energy defibrillation. However, there is some evidence that ATP can be effective even for very fast VTs and that self-termination is not uncommon. This has led to strategies employing longer detection times and attempts to terminate VT with ATP before or during capacitor charging. (See <a href=\"#H98224351\" class=\"local\">'Duration criteria for ventricular arrhythmia detection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidable therapy</strong> &ndash; A relatively new concept to ICD programming is to recognize therapy as not just appropriate (delivered for ventricular arrhythmia) or inappropriate (delivered for SVT or noise), but to recognize that any given therapy may be <strong>avoidable</strong>. It is increasingly accepted that self-terminating arrhythmias are common and that programming to treat slower or short duration arrhythmias tends to overtreat patients, often with negative consequences. Thus, eliminating avoidable therapy is one of the aims of modern ICD programming. (See <a href=\"#H1112020299\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to tachycardia therapies'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215689171\"><span class=\"h1\">TACHYCARDIA DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern ICD programming for the detection of arrhythmias utilizes higher detection rates, longer detection durations, antitachycardia pacing (ATP), algorithms that discriminate supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) from ventricular tachycardia (VT), and specific electrocardiographic (ECG) features to minimize the sensing of noise. All these strategies combined provide the patient with the security of ICD therapy when needed with the aim of eliminating inappropriate and avoidable therapies. </p><p>ICDs detect arrhythmias based on two primary criteria (both must be satisfied):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration criteria &ndash; An arrhythmia must be of sufficient length to be significant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rate criteria &ndash; An arrhythmia must exceed a programmed rate cutoff</p><p/><p>With early generation ICDs in clinical practice, the focus was on rapid detection and treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/ventricular</span> fibrillation (VF). This was necessary due to the inherent limitations of the devices: long charge times, potential for undersensing, monophasic waveforms, and the knowledge that defibrillation thresholds increased with VF duration. Therefore, early generation ICDs were programmed to detect and treat arrhythmia rapidly.</p><p>With subsequent technological improvements in ICDs, resulting in the advent of stored electrograms, improved electrogram sensing, and the move toward primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, there has been a gradual appreciation of the adverse effects of an ICD shock. Initially, the focus was mainly on <strong>inappropriate shocks</strong> (ie, shocks delivered for nonlife-threatening arrhythmias or because of oversensing). Oversensing is divided into physiological oversensing (eg, T-wave oversensing or double counting of QRS) or nonphysiological oversensing (eg, electromagnetic interference or lead fracture noise). More recently, there has been an appreciation that ventricular arrhythmias may self-terminate without therapy and that slower arrhythmias need not necessarily be treated. Early shock therapies for benign or self-terminating ventricular arrhythmias may appear to be appropriate shocks, but if they were not going to be absolutely necessary, then shocks for these rhythms are <strong>avoidable shocks</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H919833868\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach to tachycardia detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our recommendations for tachycardia detection programming in patients with an ICD are generally in agreement with the 2015 <span class=\"nowrap\">HRS/EHRA/APHRS/SOLAECE</span> Expert Consensus Statement on Optimal Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Programming and Testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with any ICD (primary or secondary prevention), we recommend that tachyarrhythmia detection duration criteria be programmed to require the tachycardia to continue for at least 6 to 12 seconds (or for 30 intervals), rather than a shorter duration, before completing detection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a primary prevention ICD (and for secondary prevention patients in whom the VT rate is not known), we recommend that the slowest tachycardia therapy zone limit should be programmed between 185 and 200 beats per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For secondary prevention ICD patients for whom the clinical VT rate is known, we program the slowest tachycardia therapy zone at least 10 beats per minute below the documented tachycardia rate but not faster than 200 beats per minute. </p><p/><p>The aim of the above three recommendations is to reduce the total number of ICD therapies.

This will allow for a greater number of nonsustained arrhythmias to terminate spontaneously, without any ICD therapy, thereby reducing avoidable shocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115226\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115226 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Early ICDs used short duration &quot;detection&quot; criteria of up to five seconds (variable depending on manufacturer and tachycardia rate) before either ATP or charging to shock. This time period was comprised of detection time plus duration or number of intervals. More recently, awareness of potential harm from avoidable shocks has led to strategies of prolonged detection settings, with data derived from numerous studies, initially from the nonrandomized PREPARE and RELEVANT studies but subsequently from three randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MADIT-RIT, a randomized trial of three different ICD programming and therapy strategies, assigned 1500 patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention (both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy) to one of three programming strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Conventional&quot; therapy programming &ndash; 2.5-second delay at rates of 170 to 199 beats per minute; 1-second delay at rates of 200 or more beats per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delayed therapy programming &ndash; 60-second delay at rates of 170 to 199 beats per minute; 12-second delay at rates of 200 to 249 beats per minute; 2.5-second delay at rates of 250 or more beats per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-rate therapy programming &ndash; No therapy at rates of 170 to 199 beats per minutes; 2.5-second delay at rates of 200 or more beats per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients were followed for an average of 1.4 years, with the primary outcome being the time to first delivery of inappropriate therapy and two prespecified secondary outcomes (all-cause mortality and first syncopal episode). While relatively few patients received appropriate ICD therapy (242 patients, or 16 percent, with 70 percent of appropriate therapies being ATP), the primary outcome occurred in 152 patients (11 percent). When compared with conventional programming:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inappropriate therapies were lower in both high-rate therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.13-0.34) and the delayed therapy (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15-0.40) groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All-cause mortality was lower in the high-rate therapy group (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.85), and there was a trend toward lower mortality in the delayed therapy group that was not statistically significant (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.30-1.02).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ADVANCE III trial, a randomized, single blind trial of 1902 patients receiving an ICD for primary (1425 patients, 75 percent) or secondary (477 patients, 25 percent) prevention, assigned patients to &quot;standard&quot; detection <span class=\"nowrap\">(18/24)</span> or long detection <span class=\"nowrap\">(30/40)</span> strategies for ventricular rates &gt;187 beats per minute (cycle length &le;320 milliseconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Programming for treatment options of ATP and shocks was the same for all participants. Long detection was associated with a highly significant reduction of overall therapies (appropriate and inappropriate ATP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shocks), inappropriate shocks, and all-cause hospitalizations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the PROVIDE trial, which randomized 1670 patients to experimental programming (two VT and one VF zone requiring 25-, 18-, and 12-beat detections, respectively) or conventional programming (12-beat detection in each of two zones), there was a 36 percent reduction in two-year all-cause shock rate and reduction in mortality with a prolonged detection interval (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.50-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>These studies (PREPARE, RELEVANT, MADIT-RIT, ADVANCE III, and PROVIDE) consistently showed that programming a prolonged detection algorithm benefited the patient without compromising safety. Importantly, ADVANCE III included a subset of secondary prevention patients (published separately) in whom similar findings were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Subsequent meta-analyses of these trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit in the combined therapy-reduction arms without an increased risk of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, there are some limitations to be acknowledged, including that not all ICD manufacturers are represented in these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], there are no data from aging devices in which charge times can be long, and there will always be specific situations in which prolonged detection times may be deleterious (eg, ventricular undersensing).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962448497\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate criteria for ventricular arrhythmia detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection by implantable devices is primarily based on rate. For the vast majority of patients with modern ICDs, the devices should be programmed to a higher rate at which therapies should be provided. This will prevent inappropriate shocks for slower supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and allow for slower nonsustained arrhythmias to terminate spontaneously, thereby reducing avoidable shocks.</p><p>Heart rates can be extremely rapid during ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and it is less likely that such rates are achieved during supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, thus making rate a powerful component of arrhythmia discrimination. However, VT can also have slower rates in the range of those of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias or even of sinus tachycardia. Therefore, any rate cutoff will always imply a trade-off between maximizing sensitivity for ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection at the expense of inappropriate detection of fast supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and maximizing specificity at the expense of some slow VTs going undetected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The recognition of a significant number of inappropriate therapies in ICD patients, as well as their potentially deleterious consequences, prompted the development of studies that tested if programming faster rate criteria would reduce avoidable ICD therapies and, particularly, shocks. In the MADIT-RIT trial, the primary end point of first occurrence of inappropriate therapy was observed in 20 percent of the conventional group and in 4 percent of the high-rate group over a mean follow-up of 1.4 years. ICD shocks occurred in 4 and 2 percent in the conventional and high-rate groups, respectively. Importantly, all-cause mortality was approximately double in the conventional group (6.6 percent) than in the high-rate group (3.2 percent). Observational studies have demonstrated that even a rate cutoff of 220 beats per minute has been shown to be safe and reduce avoidable shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H98224351\" class=\"local\">'Duration criteria for ventricular arrhythmia detection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112328026\"><span class=\"h2\">Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia discrimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SVTs are common in patients with ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. If the ICD interprets an SVT incorrectly as VT, the patient may experience inappropriate shocks, which occur in up to 20 to 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. The majority of inappropriate shocks for SVT occur within the range of 181 to 213 beats per minute. Therefore, adjustment of rate criteria and the deployment of SVT discriminators are most likely to be successful at around these rates. Once the duration and rate criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> have been satisfied, SVT discriminators aim to classify the rhythm as SVT (therapies for VT withheld) or VT (therapies delivered).</p><p>Examples of algorithms used to distinguish SVT from VT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV dissociation &ndash; Identification of different and distinct rhythms in the atrium and the ventricle, particularly when the ventricular rate exceeds the atrial rate, is consistent with AV dissociation seen with VT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial rate exceeds ventricular rate &ndash; In dual-chamber devices (and those with an atrial sensing ring on the ventricular lead), information from the atrial electrode may help differentiate VT from atrial tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/18-20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20,25</a>]. The primary discriminator is heart rate; if the atrial rate is greater than the ventricular rate, the arrhythmia is almost certainly SVT, usually atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter. However, care must be taken not to withhold therapy in the case of a &quot;dual tachycardia&quot; (eg, VT with coexisting AF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QRS templates &ndash; Many devices record templates of the ventricular electrogram during intrinsic rhythm. During a tachyarrhythmia, the device compares the electrograms during the tachycardia with the baseline recording. Deviations in shape, duration, and polarity all increase the likelihood that the device will categorize the tachycardia as VT or VF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An interval stability criterion detects irregularity in cycle length and can distinguish AF from VT. Obvious pitfalls with this are regularization of AF (perhaps from antiarrhythmic drugs) and irregular VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An onset criterion monitors the cycle length for the sudden or abrupt onset of a high ventricular rate (indicative of a VT) rather than a gradually increasing heart rate (as might be seen in exercise-induced sinus tachycardia). As this discriminator is applied &quot;once only,&quot; care should be taken not to allow this discriminator to withhold therapy indefinitely (in case of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> occurring after the rate threshold is crossed gradually). Some dual-chamber devices have &quot;chamber of onset&quot; as a discriminator.</p><p/><p>Each of these discrimination features is designed to help prevent SVT from being erroneously categorized as VT or VF; therefore, they reduce the likelihood of inappropriate shocks. However, as none of these discriminators are 100 percent specific for SVT, these discriminators can be programmed to &quot;time out&quot; so that the ICD eventually treats the arrhythmia as <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. As discriminator reliability has improved, recommendations have moved away from endorsing the use of the &quot;time out&quot; feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In addition to discrimination criteria, most contemporary ICDs have a &quot;second look&quot; feature designed to help prevent or limit inappropriate shocks. Once the criteria for delivering a shock are met, the capacitors charge. This takes several seconds (more as the device ages). Following charging, the device reevaluates the heart rhythm to confirm that the tachycardia persists and has not spontaneously terminated. If the tachycardia has resolved, the shock will be diverted.</p><p>Dual-chamber ICDs can be programmed for mode switching to prevent inappropriate tracking of atrial arrhythmias. In addition, some devices can deliver therapy for atrial tachyarrhythmias such as pace termination of atrial flutter or AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Displacement of the ICD lead into the fibrillating atrium is also possible in the immediate post-implant period. The problem of T-wave oversensing has led to several methods to identify this, including high bandpass filters, altering the sensing bipole, reducing sensitivity, and looking for specific repetitive patterns consistent with T-wave oversensing. Additionally, physiological noise due to T-wave oversensing can often be remedied with reprogramming (eg, adjusting sensitivity, etc).</p><p>Nonphysiological noise is most commonly related to ICD lead failure. Several high-profile lead recalls have brought this issue to the forefront and led to the development of algorithms designed to alert the clinician early to a potential lead failure and to delay or divert therapy if noise is the likely reason for the episode detected. </p><p>Generally, the following features are identified when detecting lead noise:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervals are very short; so short as to be physiologically unlikely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Such short intervals are transient and repetitive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If noise is present on the lead distal bipole, it is absent on the wide bipole (shock coil electrogram)</p><p/><p>The first two of these are used to provide alerts (vibratory, audible, or via home monitor).

Initial shocks are sometimes programmed for lower energies to reduce capacitor charge time and save battery (although all shocks should be at least 10 joules above the defibrillation threshold). Subsequent shocks are usually delivered at higher energies, often at the maximum output of the ICD (eg, 30 to 40 joules), to optimize efficacy. If the defibrillation threshold is determined, the first shock should be 10 joules above this value.

Therefore, the benefit of dual-chamber pacing modes is largely confined to improved exercise capacity and the avoidance of pacemaker syndrome, which occurs when single-chamber ventricular pacing conducts retrogradely to the atria resulting in atrial contraction against closed AV valves.

The programming choices in S-ICDs are limited to detection rate, one- or two-zone detection, post-shock pacing, and therapies on or off. Some automatic features may be manually overridden. As the S-ICD does not act as a pacemaker, bradycardia programming recommendations do not apply. Candidates for the S-ICD must initially be screened with a modified trichannel surface ECG that mimics the sensing vectors of the S-ICD system. This test is designed to assess the R wave to T wave ratio for appropriate signal characteristics and relationships. If the screening is not satisfactory for at least one of the three vectors both supine and standing, an S-ICD should not be implanted.

(See <a href=\"#H267598122\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to optimal ICD programming seeks to emphasize that, while the decision to implant the ICD and perioperative management are important factors in patient outcome, much of the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio of these devices is determined by the way they are programmed. When recommending ICD programming settings, we are often guided in our general approach by randomized trials. However, specific patient circumstances may mandate a different approach from that of generic programming recommendations. (See <a href=\"#H2617699412\" class=\"local\">'General approach to programming'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While ICDs are implanted primarily for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias, some patients require pacing for bradycardia at the time of implantation, while others will develop a need for bradycardia support at a later time. In general, single- and dual-chamber ICDs should be programmed to avoid ventricular pacing, whenever feasible; cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) devices should be programmed to encourage biventricular pacing. (See <a href=\"#H557450534\" class=\"local\">'Bradycardia programming'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4167171358\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to bradycardia programming'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modern ICD programming for the detection of arrhythmias utilizes higher detection rates, longer detection durations, antitachycardia pacing (ATP), algorithms that discriminate supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) from VT, and specific ECG features to minimize the sensing of noise. All these strategies combined provide the patient with the security of ICD therapy when needed with the aim of eliminating inappropriate and avoidable therapies. (See <a href=\"#H2215689171\" class=\"local\">'Tachycardia detection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H919833868\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to tachycardia detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with any ICD (primary or secondary prevention), we recommend that tachyarrhythmia detection duration criteria be programmed to require the tachycardia to continue for at least 6 to 12 seconds (or for 30 intervals), rather than a shorter duration, before completing detection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a primary prevention ICD (and for secondary prevention patients in whom the VT rate is not known), we recommend that the slowest tachycardia therapy zone limit should be programmed between 185 and 200 beats per minute (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For secondary prevention ICD patients for whom the clinical VT rate is known, we program the slowest tachycardia therapy zone at least 10 beats per minute below the documented tachycardia rate but not faster than 200 beats per minute. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modern ICD programming for the treatment of arrhythmias utilizes ATP as the initial therapy for many patients with VT, given the high rates of successful VT termination following ATP. If ATP is unsuccessful, or if the presenting rhythm is VF, ICDs can deliver one or more defibrillatory shocks in an effort to terminate <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1764413667\" class=\"local\">'Tachycardia therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1112020299\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to tachycardia therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients with structural heart disease and ATP-capable devices, ATP therapy should be active for all ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection zones to include arrhythmias up to 230 beats per minute (except when ATP is documented to be ineffective or proarrhythmic). This aims to reduce total shocks. ATP therapy should be programmed to deliver at least one ATP attempt with a minimum of eight stimuli and a cycle length 84 to 88 percent of the tachycardia cycle length for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Burst ATP therapy is preferred to ramp ATP therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We activate shock therapy in all ventricular tachyarrhythmia therapy zones to improve the termination rate of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, except in rare cases where ATP only might be prescribed for hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We program the initial shock energy to the maximal available energy in the highest rate detection zone to improve the first shock termination of ventricular arrhythmias, unless specific defibrillation testing demonstrates efficacy at lower energies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Programming is simpler with the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD). The programming choices in S-ICDs are limited to detection rate, one- or two-zone detection, post-shock pacing, and therapies on or off. Some automatic features may be manually overridden. As the S-ICD does not act as a pacemaker, bradycardia programming recommendations do not apply. (See <a href=\"#H3933684287\" class=\"local\">'The subcutaneous ICD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive therapies with antiarrhythmic medication <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> catheter ablation are important in the management of patients treated with an ICD, particularly as an effort to prevent recurrent ICD shocks in patients who have received multiple ICD shocks. Additionally, many other therapies such as those indicated for heart failure (eg, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or in specific conditions (eg, cervical sympathectomy for long QT syndrome) are complementary to ICD therapy. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is warranted for the management of ICD patients.
