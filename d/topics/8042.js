The plantar fascia is a tough band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73704 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis is very common. It often affects people who run, jump, or stand for long periods. Most people who get this type of heel pain get better within a year even if they do not get treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472262599\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of plantar fasciitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom is pain under the heel and sole (bottom) of the foot. The pain is often worst when you first get out of bed in the morning. It can also be bad when you get up after being seated for some time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472262606\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rest</strong> &ndash; Give your foot a chance to heal by resting. But don't completely stop being active. Doing that can lead to more pain and stiffness in the long run.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ice your foot</strong> &ndash; Putting ice on your heel for 20 minutes up to 4 times a day might relieve pain. Icing and massaging your foot before exercise might also help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Do special foot exercises</strong> &ndash; Certain exercises can help with heel pain. Do these exercises every day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73613 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Take pain medicines</strong> &ndash; If your pain is severe, you can try taking pain medicines that you can get without a prescription. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). But if you have other medical conditions or already take other medicines, ask your doctor or nurse before taking new pain medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wear sturdy shoes</strong> &ndash; Sneakers with a lot of cushion and good arch and heel support are best. Shoes with rigid soles can also help. Adding padded or gel heel inserts to your shoes might help, too.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wear splints at night</strong> &ndash; Some people feel better if they wear a splint while they sleep that keeps their foot straight. These splints are sold in drugstores and medical supply stores.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472262613\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for plantar fasciitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. He or she might suggest an X-ray, or other tests to check whether your symptoms might be caused by something else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472262620\"><span class=\"h1\">How is plantar fasciitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to try the things you can do on your own. But if you do not get better, or your symptoms are severe, your doctor or nurse might suggest:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taping up your foot in a special way that helps the support the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53721\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53721 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special shoe inserts, made to fit your foot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shots (that go into your foot) of a medicine called a steroid, which can help with the pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a splint over your foot and ankle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery (this is an option only in some cases that do not get better with other treatments)</p><p/><p>Some doctors also suggest a treatment called &quot;shock wave therapy.&quot; This treatment is painful and has not been proven to work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472262627\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to keep from getting heel pain again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce the chances that your pain will come back:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes that fit well, have a lot of cushion, and support the heel and ankle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid wearing slippers, flip-flops, slip-ons, or poorly fitted shoes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid going barefoot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not wear worn-out shoes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472262634\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heel-pain-caused-by-plantar-fasciitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heel pain (caused by plantar fasciitis) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
