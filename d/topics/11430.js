Blood is made up of different types of cells. These cells are made in the center of bones, in a part called the bone marrow. </p><p>When people have MDS, their bone marrow does not work normally. It makes abnormal blood cells and does not make enough normal blood cells. This can cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19865643\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of MDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with MDS have no symptoms. They might find out that they have MDS after they have blood tests for another reason.</p><p>Other people do have symptoms. They might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel weak, tired, or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruise or bleed more easily than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get infections more easily than usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19865650\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for MDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To test for MDS, your doctor or nurse can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor removes a very small sample of the bone marrow. Then another doctor looks at the cells under a microscope to see if abnormal cells are present.</p><p/><p>There are different types of MDS. Your doctor will use your test results to figure out which type you have. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19865657\"><span class=\"h1\">How is MDS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for you will depend, for the most part, on the type of MDS you have, your symptoms, and your age. Most treatments do not cure MDS. But treatments can improve symptoms and help people feel better.</p><p>Doctors usually treat MDS with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusions &ndash; A blood transfusion is when a person gets blood that was given (donated) by another person. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors can use different types of medicines to treat MDS. These medicines work in different ways. Some medicines help the bone marrow make more blood cells. Other medicines affect the body's infection-fighting system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. It can be used to target the abnormal cells found in MDS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This treatment uses chemotherapy or another treatment called radiation to kill the abnormal cells in the bone marrow. These dead cells are then replaced with &quot;donor&quot; cells. The &quot;donor&quot; cells can come from different places. They usually come from people whose blood matches yours. Bone marrow transplant is the only treatment that can cure MDS.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse might also talk with you about being in a clinical trial. A clinical trial is a research study that uses volunteers to test new treatments or new combinations of current treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19865664\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
