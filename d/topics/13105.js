The secondary process of bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) is the result of nonclonal fibroblastic proliferation and hyperactivity induced by growth factors abnormally shed from clonally expanded megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. BMF is the hallmark of PMF and contributes to the impaired hematopoiesis that leads to severe anemia. In addition to BMF and anemia, patients with PMF suffer from marked splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe constitutional symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-primary-myelofibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The potential to arrest or reverse the BMF in PMF may offer an alternative approach to palliative therapy. With this goal in mind, the pathogenesis of PMF will be discussed here. The prognosis and treatment of PMF are discussed separately.

PMF, along with the other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia, is considered to arise from a somatic mutation of a pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A defective stem cell &quot;niche&quot; within the bone marrow has been postulated for PMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of PMF has, in a minority of cases, been linked to exposure to thorium dioxide, petroleum manufacturing plants (especially toluene and benzene), and ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. A very high incidence of PMF has been noted in patients given thorium-based radiographic contrast material and in individuals exposed to atomic bombs at Hiroshima [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Mice with a mutation of the GATA-1 transcription factor gene develop a hematologic picture similar to myelofibrosis at 15 months of age, and may represent a suitable animal model for the human disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR ABNORMALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chromosomal and other genetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) have clonal karyotypic abnormalities at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/5,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-20</a>]. However, none of these abnormalities is specific to this disorder. The most common findings, accounting for 50 to 65 percent of the karyotypic changes, are deletion of a segment of the chromosome bearing the retinoblastoma gene (13q-), 20q-, and partial trisomy 1q (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53281 \">table 2</a>).

The detrimental effect of unfavorable karyotype was mostly attributed to monosomal karyotype or <span class=\"nowrap\">inv(3)/i(17q)</span>.</p><p>Gains of chromosome 9 or 9p have also been noted in our studies (13 percent) and those of others (50 percent), suggesting that genes on 9p may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of interest, mutations of JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a gene found on 9p, have been found in approximately 50 percent of patients with PMF. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'JAK2 mutations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Mutations in PV, ET, and PMF'</a>.)</p><p>A number of genetic mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in patients with PMF and other myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with leukemic transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. As an example, a A3669G polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor was found to contribute to the phenotype of excess myeloproliferation in PMF (eg, higher white blood cell count, larger spleen, higher frequency of CD34+ cells at diagnosis) and, in cooperation with the <em>JAK2</em>V617F mutation, increasing the risk of blastic transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In summary, mutations in PMF involve primarily <em>JAK2</em> but also to a smaller extent <em>MPL</em>, <em>LNK</em>, <em>CBL</em>, <em>TET2</em>, <em>ASXL1</em>, <em>IDH1</em>, <em>IDH2</em>, <em>IKZF1</em>, <em>EZH2, DNMT3A, TP53, SF3B1 </em>and<em> SFSR2</em>. None of these mutations has been consistently traced back to the ancestral clone, and their disease-initiating potential is uncertain. Some (eg, <em>JAK2</em> and <em>SF3B1</em> mutations) might contribute to specific phenotypes such as erythrocytosis and ring sideroblasts, respectively. Available data suggest inferior survival in PMF associated with nullizygosity for <em>JAK2</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">46/1</span> haplotype, low <em>JAK2</em>V617F allele burden, and the presence of <em>IDH, ASXL1, SRSF2 </em>or <em>EZH2</em> mutations. Some of these mutations (eg, <em>IDH</em>, <em>SRSF2</em>) have also been associated with inferior leukemia-free survival. In contrast, the presence or absence of <em>JAK2</em>V617F, <em>MPL </em>or <em>TET2 </em>mutations do not appear to affect survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12005307\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibroblasts do not share the chromosomal abnormalities found in hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As a result, it is thought that bone marrow fibrosis, as well as many of the other signs and symptoms of PMF, are secondary reactions to the clonal hemopathy mediated by cytokines released from the neoplastic megakaryocytes and other clonally expanded hematopoietic cells, such as T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous hematopoietic colony growth in vitro</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the hallmarks of polycythemia vera (PV) is in vitro erythropoietin- independent growth of red blood cell (RBC) colonies.

The finding of novel somatic activating mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL mutations W515L and W515K) in approximately 5 percent of patients with PMF, 1 percent of those with ET, and in none of the patients with PV suggests that these MPL mutations favor megakaryocyte fate while the JAK2 mutation favors erythroid fate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/35,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE MARROW FIBROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) results from the abnormal deposition of excess collagen derived from fibroblasts.

Thus, BMF in PMF is a reactive process accompanying the underlying clonal stem cell disorder.</p><p>The major megakaryocyte-derived cytokine implicated in the mediation of BMF in PMF is transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/4,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,45</a>], which may interact with thrombopoietin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56172 \">figure 1</a>). Other growth factors also may contribute to the fibrotic reaction, including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), calmodulin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and lysyl oxidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/4,5,45-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,45-52</a>].

In a study of 25 patients with PMF, significantly decreased plasma levels of MMP-3 were found, which correlated inversely with the degree of bone marrow fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Elevated levels of TIMP-1 were also found, suggesting that the balance between MMPs and TIMP may be essential in fibrosis formation.</p><p>It has been suggested, based upon a murine model and on bone marrow samples from patients with PMF, that there is a significant degree of entry of hematopoietic cells into megakaryocyte cytoplasm, a phenomenon called emperipolesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This is probably brought about by increased expression and abnormal localization of P-selectin by the megakaryocytes, leading to engulfment, activation, and damage to the cells, mainly neutrophils and eosinophils, passing through the megakaryocyte cytoplasm. The result is release of lytic granules from the engulfed cells, progressive destruction of megakaryocytes with degradation and lysis of their alpha granules, and release of growth factors, resulting in the marked fibroblast activation and infiltration characteristic of PMF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Transforming growth factor-beta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major megakaryocyte-derived cytokine implicated in the mediation of BMF in PMF is transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, which may interact with thrombopoietin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56172 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/46,56-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,56-61</a>].</p><p>TGF-beta is a glycoprotein that is synthesized and secreted primarily by the monocyte-macrophage system and endothelial cells, and also by megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/4,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,56,57</a>].

Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the major growth factor required for megakaryocyte growth and development. The TPO glycoprotein can be modified by deglycosylation and subsequent coupling to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to be less immunogenic and have an extended half-life.</p><p>Mice injected daily with high doses of PEG-TPO develop a reversible bone marrow fibrosis accompanied by thrombocytosis, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>].

Although the process was reversible by bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], chronic exposure led to a fatal myeloproliferative disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>The role of TPO has been further evaluated in immune-compromised mice. Overexpression of the TPO gene using adenovectors in SCID mice (severe combined immune deficient) resulted in thrombocytosis, increased marrow megakaryocytes, fibrosis, and extramedullary hematopoiesis that mimicked PMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

EMH is rarely as effective as medullary hematopoiesis, thereby leading to the cytopenias so often found in this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED BONE MARROW VASCULARITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have shown that bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) is increased in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and other <span class=\"nowrap\">BCR/ABL1-negative</span> myeloproliferative neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. In one of the studies, MVD was significantly increased in 114 patients with PMF, when compared with bone marrows from 44 normal controls, 15 patients with polycythemia vera and 17 with essential thrombocythemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-mechanisms-in-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. This phenomenon, as with bone marrow fibrosis, is thought to be secondary to release of several growth factors by megakaryocytes (eg, VEGF, PDGF, TGF-beta, bFGF). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow fibrosis'</a> above.)</p><p>In this study, increased MVD significantly correlated with the presence of megakaryocyte clumping, increased splenic size, and, in a multivariate model, decreased overall survival.
