People can get it from eating certain foods.</p><p>Listeria can be mild or severe. It is not usually serious in healthy people. But it can be more dangerous in pregnant women than in people who are not pregnant. Plus, a pregnant woman can pass Listeria to her unborn baby. The unborn baby can get very sick and even die.</p><p>Certain other people are also at risk of getting very sick from Listeria. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn babies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older people</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have AIDS, cancer, diabetes, or another serious medical condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who had an organ transplant or stem cell transplant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who take medicines that make it hard for the body to fight off infections</p><p/><p>These people are more likely to get Listeria infections in the bloodstream or brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77112652\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Listeria infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different depending on which part of the body is affected.</p><p>People with Listeria infection in the <strong>brain and spinal cord</strong> can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion or trouble thinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak muscles on one side of the body, trouble walking, or shaky hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

Which ones you need will depend on your symptoms, whether you are pregnant, and if you have other medical conditions. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle into your lower back and takes out a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do tests on the fluid to look for Listeria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of your bowel movement (if you could have Listeria that affects the digestive system)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests of the brain &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can include an MRI or CT scan.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77112714\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Listeria treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women, newborn babies, and people with serious Listeria infections are treated with medicines called antibiotics. These are usually given through a thin tube that goes into a vein called an &quot;IV.&quot; People who are very sick might need treatment in the hospital.</p><p>Healthy people with Listeria that affects the digestive system don't usually need treatment. The infection usually goes away on its own in about 2 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77112729\"><span class=\"h1\">Can Listeria be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting Listeria by paying attention to food safety.
