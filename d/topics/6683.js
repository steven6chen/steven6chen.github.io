It may result from the use of force, the threat of force, or from the victim's inability or refusal to give consent. Sexual assault victims do not &quot;entice&quot; their assailants; sexual assault is an act of conquest and control.</p><p>The evaluation and treatment of adult and older adolescent victims of sexual assault are discussed here. Caring for child victims of sexual assault, general trauma evaluation and management, and sexually transmitted infections are all reviewed separately.

The review noted that data is scant in particular regions (central sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific) and therefore, must be interpreted cautiously, but reported that the prevalence appeared to be highest in central sub-Saharan Africa (21 percent; 95% CI 4.5-37.5) and southern sub-Saharan Africa (17.4 percent; 95% CI 11.4-23.3). When interpreting this study, it is important to remember that sexual violence perpetrated by intimate partners was <strong>not</strong> included, and that were such data added the overall prevalence would be much greater.</p><p>The lifetime prevalence of sexual assault in the United States is approximately 18 to 19 percent in women and 2 to 3 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In a national phone survey of college women, 2.8 percent reported a completed or attempted sexual assault in a given year; the estimated cumulative rate over four years may be as high as one in four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one series, almost 30 percent of undergraduate women reported a drug-related assault, with alcohol the most common substance involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A study of Canadian women college students reported that nearly 80 percent of sexual assaults involved alcohol or drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There may be some educational programs that can reduce the risk of sexual assault on college campuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A majority of sexual assault victims have some acquaintance with their attackers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Two-thirds of assaulted women over 55 are assaulted in their own home or in a care facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In men, the prevalence of assault appears to be higher among those who are gay, bisexual, veterans, prison inmates, and those seeking mental health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Historically, statistics from the United States federal government included only assaults upon women in the category of &quot;forcible rape.&quot; In 2013, the definition was changed to &quot;penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person,&nbsp;without the consent of the victim&quot; and has been broadened to include male victims, though this still excludes statutory rape. Reports of sexual assault using the former definition had generally declined annually since 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, reported sexual assaults probably represent only a fraction of those committed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Only 10 to 15 percent of all sexual assaults are reported to police, and women who know their assailant are less likely to report the assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2401136\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of screening for domestic violence, including sexual assault, is reviewed separately.

Patients must be counseled about each component of the evaluation and documentation.

Details will also guide the trauma assessment and will help to assess the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection.</p><p>Histories must be obtained in a sensitive and supportive manner. Advocates can support patients and help them articulate their needs and questions during the history, but advocates should not respond to questions and care should be taken to avoid asking questions in a leading or suggestive manner. Family members or other patient supports should be counseled that they might be subpoenaed as witnesses if present and that they should remain passive and silent for the evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The following details of the history should be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumstances of the assault, including date, time, location, use of weapons, force, restraints, or threats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not the victim experienced loss of consciousness or memory loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assailant's physical description along with the assailant's use of drugs or alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specifics regarding oral, vaginal, or anorectal contact or penetration along with presence or absence of ejaculation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> condom use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of trauma should be ascertained focusing especially upon the victim's mouth, breasts, vagina, and rectum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding on the part of either assailant or victim may be relevant in assessing the risk of hepatitis or HIV transmission.

Such activities can lower the yield of forensic specimen collection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Note that some states require specific forms for documenting the history and examination.</p><p>The patient should undress for the examination with a sheet beneath them to capture any falling debris for medical evidence. The physical examination should describe the patient's emotional state. The examiner should document any evidence of trauma. If possible, photographs of injuries should be taken, with the patient's consent. A ruler or an easily identified object is helpful for indicating the size of objects in photographs. Physical examination evidence of trauma is more likely to be present with examination within 72 hours of assault, and when assaults occurred out of doors or were perpetrated by strangers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Extragenital trauma may be more common than anogenital trauma (70.4 versus 26.8 percent) with bruises, abrasions, or erythema on the thigh, upper arm, face or neck particularly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In women, the breasts, external genitalia, vagina, anus, and rectum should be carefully examined. Common sites of genital injury include the posterior fourchette and the labia minora. As compared to women who have had consensual sex, assaulted women are more likely to have genital lesions at sites other than the posterior fourchette, and are more likely to have multiple areas of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Genital trauma occurs more commonly in postmenopausal women and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/14,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26</a>], and detectable trauma is more likely in women reporting vaginal or anal penetration and in virgins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Suggested terminology for describing examination findings includes the TEARS categorization: <strong>T</strong>ears (defined as any break in tissue including fissures and lacerations), <strong>E</strong>cchymoses, <strong>A</strong>brasions, <strong>R</strong>edness, and <strong>S</strong>welling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Colposcopic examination can enhance detection of areas of milder genital trauma and is now performed by most SANE programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. A Wood's lamp or other UV light source may help identify foreign debris and semen on the skin. Evidence of anogenital trauma is enhanced with colposcopy or use of toluidine blue dye (TBD). However, toluidine dye can be difficult to use and is not endorsed in all United States jurisdictions.</p><p>In male victims, close attention should be paid to the penis and scrotum, evaluating for erythema, ecchymosis, excoriation, laceration, or suction marks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Penile examination should focus particularly on the glans and frenulum, and should also assess for urethral discharge. Rectal examination should be considered and performed if there was anal penetration. The prostate should be assessed for tenderness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Forensic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forensic evaluation should be offered to victims of abuse, but is not mandatory and requires informed consent. If sexual assault is suspected but the patient is unable to provide consent, it is controversial as to whether or not to perform this examination. A previously identified guardian would be authorized to provide consent. In the absence of a guardian or surrogate decision maker, portions of the examination might be done if routine examination already requires examination of those areas, would not induce additional discomfort, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if a medical procedure is to be done that would destroy evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Components of examination should <strong>not</strong> be done if they would require sedation, and photographs of intimate areas should not be taken without consent. Materials obtained prior to consent would only be released to law enforcement when consent is obtained later.</p><p>Forensic evaluation requires collection of numerous specimens. If the patient is brought by ambulance from the site of the assault, any sheets used to transport the patient and any debris on them should be kept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Providers should use evidence collection kits with careful attention to guidelines for specimen collection. There are a variety of commercial collection kits available; some states require specific kits. Kits can be obtained through state distribution programs or directly from kit manufacturers. States in the United States are required to offer free evidence collection, irrespective of a victim's intent to pursue police reporting, in order to qualify for federal funds in the STOP program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Collected samples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The victim's clothing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swabs and smears from the buccal mucosa, vagina, and rectum and from other areas highlighted by ultraviolet light</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combed specimens from the scalp and pubic hair</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingernail scrapings and clippings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control samples of the victim's scalp and pubic hair (ideally, at least 20 to 25 pulled hairs per site)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole blood sample</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saliva sample</p><p/><p>Given the painful and invasive nature of plucking hairs and the fact that hair can be removed from a victim at a later date as long as the victim is available, some jurisdictions no longer require hair samples. It is best to check with the local prosecutor's office to clarify their policy. Kits contain specific collection materials, specific containers for each specimen obtained, and detailed collection instructions. Specimens may need to be dried; some jurisdictions mandate specific drying techniques. When completed, kits must be sealed, labeled, and stored using kit-specific directions to ensure rigor in maintaining an unbroken chain of evidence.</p><p>Samples are examined for spermatozoa and for acid phosphatase as an assay for semen; it is recommended that these analyses be performed in forensic laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Collected samples can also be analyzed for DNA. Sperm has been detected in vaginal samples up to 72 hours after assault and in anal samples up to 24 hours after assault; sperm are not generally detectable in oral samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The yield of evidentiary examinations generally declines with time and with specific behaviors, like changing clothes, showering, and brushing teeth. However, there is no absolute interval during which evidence must be obtained, and as DNA technologies develop the time available for evidence collection may expand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As an example, swabs from external skin would not be useful in a victim who presents over 24 hours after an assault and has showered in the interim, but cervical and vaginal swabs, and possibly fingernail scrapings, would still be valuable. The key principle is that there is only one opportunity to collect evidence so when in doubt it is best to obtain it. Individual jurisdictions determine the maximal time interval during which certain evidence may be collected; intervals vary depending upon patient history, hygiene, and the specimen being obtained. Historically, many jurisdictions limited evidence collection to the first 72 hours after assault, but many jurisdictions have extended the period to five to seven days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Perpetrator evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians may occasionally be called upon to perform forensic evaluation of an assault perpetrator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Principles for evidentiary examinations are similar to those for victims, and require evidence collection kits and strict attention to maintain the chain of evidence. Because the suspect has the right to remain silent, no history may be given but if the examiner inquires and the suspect responds then all historical information should be recorded. Swabs, hair combing, and fingernail sampling are obtained. Penile swabs should be collected from the shaft, glans, and area under the foreskin; finger swabs would be done in cases of digital penetration of a victim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Bruises, scratches and bite marks are identified, with swabbing of bites and scratches to identify victim DNA. Blood samples for HIV and hepatitis B can be drawn and held; in many jurisdictions victims can ask the court to have the suspect tested.</p><p>Physical examination evidence of trauma is most common on the hands, forearms, face, and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Permanent physical attributes, such as tattoos, are described. If victim and assailant are in the same facility, they should be evaluated in physically separate settings by different personnel to avoid any accusation of cross contamination of specimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory evaluation is focused on trauma assessment, testing for sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy testing. Radiographic imaging is guided by the history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929775\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic studies'</a>.)</p><p>Testing for sexually transmitted infection has been considered elective, as guidelines suggest empiric treatment of possibly acquired infections regardless and testing does not provide clear evidence of infection acquired at the time of assault (identified infections may be preexisting). Historically, there has been concern that positive tests might be used by the defense as evidence of promiscuity to discredit the victim, although many states limit the evidentiary use of a victim's prior sexual history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, although this rarely occurs, evidence of a sexually transmitted infection obtained at the time of the evaluation for assault could be accessed later, and some patients or providers may choose to defer testing for this reason.</p><p>Victims may forego testing if they plan to take prophylactic treatment for infections. Testing is particularly important for the patient who initially declines treatment to ensure that appropriate therapy can be provided.</p><p>The 2015 guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in women for chlamydia and gonorrhea at the site(s) of exposure (vaginal, anal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral), and vaginal trichomonas NAAT testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. We agree with this approach. The World Health Organization recommends empiric treatment for sexually transmitted infections, but makes no recommendations regarding testing for infections during the evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Serum testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis are recommended. Although there are reports of sexual transmission of hepatitis C, there are no known reports of transmission associated with sexual assault and testing for hepatitis C is not addressed in current CDC recommendations. Given the relatively low risk, and the absence of protocols for prophylaxis against hepatitis C, most programs have not incorporated hepatitis C testing into the evaluation of sexual assault and we believe this is reasonable.

Even when reporting is mandatory, victims can remain anonymous for examination and reporting purposes (eg, Jane Doe). Successful prosecution appears to be associated with evaluation within 24 hours of assault, performance of a physical examination, documentation of anogenital trauma and other injury, the use of a weapon, and assault in the context of an intimate relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>Evidence should be collected at the time of the initial evaluation and stored securely even if the patient is not planning to report the assault.

Only 10 to 15 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the sexual assault victim should be performed by a trained provider, if at all possible. A complete history should be documented. Evaluation should include psychological assessment, evaluation of areas of trauma, and examination of the breasts, pelvic and anorectal areas. Colposcopy should be performed, when possible, to detect genital trauma. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An evidence collection kit, with detailed instruction and containers for specimen collection, is necessary for a forensic evaluation. The victim should be evaluated as soon as possible after an assault, but evidence may be collected at later times depending upon factors such as patient history and hygiene. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Forensic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for sexually transmitted infection is not necessary if prophylactic treatment is to be given. Laboratory testing should include pregnancy testing in women of childbearing age. Baseline serology for syphilis and hepatitis B may be useful and HIV counseling should be provided. Drug screening may be warranted if the victim was found unconscious or has amnesia for any time surrounding the event. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest giving empiric treatment for sexually transmitted infections, especially if the patient has declined testing for STDs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Empiric therapy includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> 250 mg by intramuscular injection (IM) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> 1 g by mouth (PO) (single dose), which treats both gonorrhea and chlamydia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> 2 g PO (single dose) is also recommended to treat trichomoniasis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B vaccine should be given to patients who have not been previously immunized. HPV vaccine should be given in age eligible patients who have not been previously immunized. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1204747302\" class=\"local\">'HPV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest prophylactic treatment against HIV infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, this issue is controversial. The risk of HIV transmission is low, and the efficacy of antiretroviral drugs is unknown. Nevertheless, most organizations do suggest treatment if it can be initiated within 72 hours of exposure, and ideally within four hours. We concur with this approach. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that postcoital contraception be offered to all patients. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute crisis counseling should be offered. Many patients experience psychological and physical symptoms over many months following the assault. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient follow-up should occur by two weeks, with psychosocial counseling, STD testing for patients who did not take empiric therapy or who have symptoms, and pregnancy testing. Hepatitis B and HPV vaccine should be given at one and six months to complete the vaccine course. HIV and RPR testing should be repeated at 12 and 24 weeks; some also recommend testing at six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abrahams N, Devries K, Watts C, et al.
