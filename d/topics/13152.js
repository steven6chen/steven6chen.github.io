These chains are derived from two copies of the alpha globin gene on chromosome 16 and a single beta globin gene on chromosome 11 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). In normal adults, globin chain synthesis is very tightly controlled such that the ratio of production of alpha to beta globin chains is 1.00&plusmn;0.05.

This discussion will focus on the mechanisms by which the excess unmatched beta globin chain synthesis in alpha thalassemia leads to increased red blood cell destruction (hemolysis). The accumulation of excess beta chains in erythroid precursors within the bone marrow and in extramedullary sites, such as the liver and spleen, also leads to a certain amount of ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><p>The molecular pathology of the thalassemias and the pathophysiology of beta thalassemia are discussed separately.

The two most common forms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha thalassemia </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Alpha thalassemia is due to impaired or absent production of alpha globin chains, which leads to a relative excess of gamma globin chains in the fetus and newborn, and excess beta globin chains in children and adults. While the excess beta globin chains are capable of forming soluble homotetramers (beta-4, HbH), they are unstable and some precipitate within the cell, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations. Since all normal hemoglobins of postnatal life contain alpha chains, homozygous alpha (0) thalassemia, in which no alpha globin chains can be produced, is incompatible with extrauterine life, leading to hydrops fetalis and death shortly after delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta thalassemia</strong> &ndash; Beta thalassemia is due to impaired production of beta globin chains, which leads to a variable excess of alpha globin chains. For reasons that are not entirely clear, excess alpha globin chains cannot form soluble homotetramers and begin aggregating as soon as they accumulate in erythroid precursors, producing insoluble aggregates even in very early marrow erythroid precursors, affecting membrane assembly and accelerating programmed cell death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A critical factor underlying the difference in pathophysiology between alpha and beta thalassemia is that, in the alpha thalassemias, the excess beta or gamma globin chains can form partially soluble but ineffective hemoglobin homotetramers. These homotetramers do not precipitate extensively until they are exposed to damaging effects in the circulation, mostly oxidant in nature. For these reasons and because of the deleterious consequences of aggregates of alpha globin, the clinical manifestations are generally less severe in alpha compared with beta thalassemia of comparable genetic severity, except for homozygous alpha (0) thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The latter is incompatible with extrauterine life.</p><p>The net loss of alpha globin synthesis reflects not only the number of alpha globin genes affected by the mutation(s), but also which of the two alpha globin loci is affected, whether the mutation(s) involved are deletional or nondeletional, and whether the nondeletional mutation(s) partially or fully block gene expression. In addition, defects in alpha globin synthesis in alpha thalassemia can ameliorate beta thalassemia severity by rebalancing the alpha to beta globin chain ratio. Thus, understanding the basis for the broad spectrum of clinical severity (phenotypes) in individual patients with alpha thalassemia requires a detailed knowledge of the underlying genetic defect(s) and the impact of these defects on the overall levels and balance of globin chain synthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the thalassemias are profoundly heterogeneous from a genetic standpoint, certain clinical terms are available to describe the phenotypic expression of the alpha thalassemias.

As a result, there are three general forms of alpha (+) thalassemia based upon the number of inherited alpha genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inheritance of <strong>three normal alpha genes</strong> <span class=\"nowrap\">(aa/a-)</span> has been termed alpha thalassemia minima, silent carrier of alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, or heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia. Affected subjects are clinically normal and may also be hematologically normal; the diagnosis can be reliably made only via DNA analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inheritance of <strong>two normal alpha genes</strong> has been termed alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait, and is due either to heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia <span class=\"nowrap\">(aa/--)</span> or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia <span class=\"nowrap\">(a-/a-)</span>.

These patients have moderate to severe degrees of lifelong hemolytic anemia, very modest degrees of ineffective erythropoiesis, splenomegaly, variable bony changes, and iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Hydrops fetalis and hemoglobin Bart's'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8671883\"><span class=\"h2\">Complex alpha thalassemia variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above definitions are useful as a starting point, although the classification of the alpha thalassemias can become extremely complex. For example, two general forms of HbH disease have been recognized, the deletional and nondeletional forms. In the former, the patient has inherited only a single alpha globin gene (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">a-/--)</span>. In the nondeletional form, the patient has inherited two alpha globin genes from one parent, but one of these carries a nondeletional defect, such as a point mutation (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">aa*/--,</span> where a* represents the mutated alpha chain, such as hemoglobin Constant Spring). HbH disease tends to be more severe in patients with the nondeletional form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], due, at least in part, to interference with transcription of the normal alpha chain gene by the abnormal one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hemoglobin Constant Spring is the most common form of nondeletional alpha thalassemia, occurring in approximately 1 to 2 percent of individuals living in northeastern Thailand, 5 to 8 percent of individuals in southern China, and one-quarter of women in an ethnic minority population in Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. It is caused by a chain termination mutation such that it not only results in a deficiency of normal alpha chains, but hemoglobin Constant Spring is itself toxic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3786212779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin H disease'</a>.)</p><p>As another example of the potential complexity of these disorders, individual patients may have combinations of alpha and beta globin gene mutations of varying nature and severity (eg, combinations or variants of alpha (0) from one parent and alpha (+) from the other with one or more beta chain abnormalities). Individuals with coinheritance of homozygous beta (+) thalassemia <span class=\"nowrap\">(b+/b+)</span> and alpha thalassemia (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">-a/-a,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">--/aa,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">-a/aa,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">--/aa)</span> will present with a form of thalassemia of intermediate clinical severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Protection against severe malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alpha thalassemia gene mutations affect up to 90 percent of some populations and appear to offer a selective advantage by protecting against severe malaria (due to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>) and perhaps other infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Papua New Guinea, there is intense malaria transmission and alpha (+) thalassemia is present in more than 90 percent of the population.

Affected patients had a hypochromic microcytic anemia of variable severity, target cells on peripheral smear, reticulocytosis, inclusions in a few red cells (Heinz bodies), many more of which could be produced by incubating RBC with mild oxidant dyes like brilliant cresyl blue, resistance to lysis by hypotonic solutions, and signs of hemolysis, including a shortened <sup>51</sup>Cr red cell survival, splenomegaly, and elevated indirect reacting bilirubin.

When this hemoglobin, now called HbH, was allowed to stand, it turned brown and precipitated, forming aggregates that looked somewhat like the red cell inclusions. This phenomenon was accentuated by addition of mild oxidants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences of impaired alpha globin synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent studies of individuals with HbH disease identified this disorder as a moderately severe form of alpha thalassemia with the deletion or inactivation of three of the four alpha genes, leading to a clinically significant unbalanced globin chain synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> synthesis ratio was found to range from 0.3 to 0.6 (normal: 1.0&plusmn;0.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The reduced synthesis of alpha globin chains in this disorder leads to an accumulation of otherwise normal beta globin chains in adults and gamma chains in the fetus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the neonatal period, before beta globin chain synthesis reaches adult levels, excess unmatched gamma globin chains accumulate and form gamma homotetramers, called HbBart's [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the adult, the excess beta globin chains assemble into beta homotetramers, called HbH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p>These two homotetramers are susceptible to oxidant injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>] and are functionally useless as oxygen delivery pigments because their affinity for oxygen is at least 10 times greater than that of HbA. They demonstrate no Bohr effect, and the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is not sigmoidal because there is no heme-heme interaction. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves for HbH and HbBart's resemble that of myoglobin, a compound that holds but cannot deliver oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The hypochromia is due both to less hemoglobin per cell as well as hyperhydration of the cell.</p><p>Unbalanced globin chain synthesis leads to a deficiency in the amount of hemoglobin per cell (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH]) and, since hemoglobin accounts for 30 to 35 percent of the red blood cell (RBC) content, the RBC volume (mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) will be low, producing the well-known hypochromic target cells and microcytosis. However, in addition to these well characterized morphologic findings, there are frequently fragmented RBCs and bizarre shapes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80776\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80776 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The introduction of sophisticated technology has allowed more precise identification of these red cell changes. The MCH tracings show that, as a consequence of time in the circulation, RBC fragmentation occurs in HbH and the alpha thalassemia variant, <span class=\"nowrap\">HbH/Constant</span> Spring <span class=\"nowrap\">(HbH/CS),</span> producing populations of tiny hemoglobin-containing fragments. It is highly likely that these fragments have shortened survival time in the circulation. Both the intact RBCs and the cell fragments with a markedly reduced surface area-to-volume ratio have great difficulty in undergoing the elongated elliptical deformation that normally allows 7 to 8 micron diameter RBCs to pass through 3 micron diameter capillaries and 2 to 3 micron slits in reticuloendothelial sinusoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement&quot;, section on 'Senescence'</a>.)</p><p>Several early observations noted that while both beta- and alpha-thalassemic RBCs were hypochromic and microcytic, the decrease in hemoglobin concentration within the RBC (ie, reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]) was more prominent in the Constant Spring thalassemic variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These observations lead to further studies of RBC hydration, discussed immediately below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Red blood cell hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RBCs are hyperhydrated in patients with severe alpha thalassemia (ie, they have a higher-than-normal ratio of water to hemoglobin and other solutes). As a result, RBCs of all ages have lower-than-normal density on density gradient analyses such as a discontinuous Stractan gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This contrasts with the RBCs of comparably anemic patients with beta thalassemia, in which populations of RBCs are found throughout the gradient. The proportions of hyperhydrated RBCs in the alpha thalassemia variants <span class=\"nowrap\">HbH/CS,</span> HbH, and <span class=\"nowrap\">HbCS/CS</span> are 70, 50, and 20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The cause of the hyperhydration in alpha thalassemic RBCs is not clear. The K-Cl cotransporter is a pH and volume activated transporter that functions in the normal remodeling of reticulocytes to mature RBCs. This transporter controls the loss of KCl and water, leading to a reduction in the MCV. It closes down in normal RBC but stays open in beta thalassemic and sickle cell RBCs in which it is partly responsible for the RBC dehydration in these disorders. It is an unproven hypothesis that, in alpha thalassemia, the K-Cl cotransporter closes down very early, thereby preventing the usual loss of K-Cl and water that is part of the red blood cell remodeling process.

As a result, gamma chains accumulate in the fetus and form gamma-4 tetramers (HbBart's).

A small component of hemoglobin H (beta-4 tetramers) may also be present if the fetus can synthesize beta chains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;, section on 'Embryonic hemoglobins'</a>.)</p><p>The result is a severe functional anemia causing high output cardiac failure with anasarca and capillary leak (&quot;hydrops&quot;). The capillary leak may be caused by increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the stressed fetal heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Other defects include a massively enlarged placenta and severe maternal complications, such as hypertension and polyhydramnios.
