For major depression, atypical antipsychotics are used adjunctively for nonpsychotic patients who respond insufficiently to antidepressant monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Second-generation antipsychotics in combination with an antidepressant are also effective for psychotic depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and the atypical antipsychotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> is effective as monotherapy for nonpsychotic depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for major depression is hypothesized to be the result of their serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>].</p><p>First-generation antipsychotics have also been used to treat depression, initially as monotherapy and subsequently as adjunctive treatment with an antidepressant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Randomized trials found that for nonpsychotic depression, first-generation antipsychotic monotherapy was superior to placebo and either comparable or superior to an antidepressant. However, the use of first-generation antipsychotics for depression has declined because of the risk of tardive dyskinesia, which is greater for first-generation than second-generation antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160;</p><p>This topic reviews the use of second-generation antipsychotics for treating unipolar major depression.

However, secondary clinical effects may differentially affect the utility of adjunctive antipsychotics for treating major depression.

By contrast, ziprasidone does not lead to weight gain. Additional secondary (side) effects are discussed separately.

Nevertheless, the number needed to treat for quetiapine was nine, which means that adjunctive quetiapine provided one more remission than placebo for every nine patients treated with each regimen; many clinicians view this as clinically meaningful. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550103\"><span class=\"h4\">Minimal response to antidepressant compared with partial response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive second-generation antipsychotics may be effective for patients with either a minimal response to antidepressant monotherapy or a partial response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-second-generation-antipsychotics/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Much of the benefit occurs within the first two weeks of treatment. Adjunctive second-generation antipsychotics may be effective for patients with either a minimal response to antidepressant monotherapy or a partial response.
