(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although other dyslipidemias, such as an elevated level of lipoprotein(a), also may promote atherosclerosis, interventions directed toward altering these have only infrequently been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Elevated serum lipoprotein(a), also referred to as Lp(a), is a risk factor for CVD. There is a causal relationship between Lp(a) excess and risk for myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk factor versus cause'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will review the genetics, structure, and function of Lp(a), as well as its association with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Possible indications for screening and therapy will also be addressed. The association between Lp(a) and aortic valve sclerosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis#H1785456712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a type of low density lipoprotein in which a large glycoprotein and two apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] proteins are covalently bound to apolipoprotein B by a disulfide bridge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The apo(a) chain contains five cysteine rich domains known as &quot;kringles&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The fourth kringle is homologous with the fibrin-binding domain of plasminogen, a plasma protein that dissolves blood clots when activated. Because of this structural similarity to plasminogen, Lp(a) interferes with fibrinolysis by competing with plasminogen binding to molecules and cells. This impairs plasminogen activation, plasmin generation, and fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Lp(a) also binds to macrophages via a high-affinity receptor that promotes foam cell formation and deposition of cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels primarily are genetically determined. In families of European descent without familial hypercholesterolemia, greater than 90 percent of the variability in Lp(a) levels can be explained by polymorphisms at the apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] gene locus (isoforms), also referred to as the <em>LPA</em> gene (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 152200) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One important <em>LPA</em> polymorphism is the kringle IV type 2 size polymorphism, which results in a large number of differently sized isoforms of apo(a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is a strong inverse relationship between the size of the apo(a) isoforms and the Lp(a) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-11</a>]. A significant proportion (30 to 60 percent) of the population variation in Lp(a) levels is determined by this polymorphism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The distribution of Lp(a) also varies between racial groups. Lp(a) levels are normally distributed in African-American populations; however, Caucasians, Eastern Asian, and Asian Indian populations have Lp(a) distributions that are skewed towards higher levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. According to the Framingham Heart Study, the 90th percentile of Lp(a) levels is 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.39 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromo/L)</span> in men and 39.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.41 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromo/L)</span> in women (units of mass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Blacks have somewhat higher values than whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of serum Lp(a) concentration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of serum Lp(a) concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lp(a) initially was identified as a &quot;sinking&quot; pre-beta lipoprotein band detected by gel electrophoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The standard method for measuring Lp(a) is density gradient ultracentrifugation. ELISA techniques are widely available; however, several of these methods are insensitive and unable to distinguish between apo(a) isoforms, which can result in significant underestimation or overestimation of Lp(a) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. A state-of-the art, commercially available assay uses a latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric method that measures Lp(a) independently of the apo(a) size and number of kringle-IV repeats and is available for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Lp(a) levels are stable in individuals with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CVD RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] excess (Lp(a) level above the 95th percentile) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary heart disease (CHD), was initially suggested by relatively small cross-sectional and retrospective epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13,14,21-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,21-37</a>]. The largest prospective analysis (2047 patients and 3921 controls) of the association between Lp(a) excess and incident CHD found an odds ratio of 1.60 (95% CI 1.38-1.85) between the upper and lower thirds of baseline Lp(a) levels after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The best data that summarize the relationship between Lp(a) and CVD come from a 2009 meta-analysis of the individual patient records of over 120,000 participants in 36 prospective studies. In this study, the association between Lp(a) and CHD risk was continuous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the 24 cohort studies in the meta-analysis, the rates of CHD were 5.6 and 4.4 per 1000 person-years in the top and bottom thirds of baseline Lp(a) distributions. After adjustment for multiple traditional risk factors, the risk ratio for CHD was 1.13 (95% CI 1.09-1.18); this is a lower risk ratio than found in the largest single study cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The increase in risk with higher Lp(a) was continuous, as has been shown in prior studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,38</a>].</p><p>Lp(a) excess is commonly detected in patients with premature CHD. In one study, for example, Lp(a) excess was present in 18.6 percent of patients with premature CHD, 12.7 percent of whom had no other dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Lp(a) is also associated with unstable angina and the presence of complex coronary lesions, suggesting a possible role in plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In patients with an acute coronary syndrome, Lp(a) concentrations predict increased risk of cardiac death. One study found that among 266 patients with an acute myocardial infarction, a Lp(a) concentration &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromo/L)</span> was associated with a 62 percent increase in cardiac death during a three-year follow-up (29.8 versus 18.6 percent for concentrations &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromo/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among 197 patients presenting with unstable angina, levels &ge;7.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.28 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromo/L)</span> were predictive of subsequent cardiac death (relative risk 2.48).</p><p>Commonly used cardiovascular multivariate risk prediction models have not included information about Lp(a) level or genotype. However, there is some evidence that measurement of apo(a) isoforms could improve risk prediction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41,42</a>].

In a second study of 826 adults followed for 15 years, the hazard ratio for incident cardiovascular disease was 1.37 per one-standard deviation higher Lp(a) level and 2.37 when comparing the top fifth quintile with other quintiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

A meta-analysis that included data from 56,010 subjects with &gt;4609 stroke events found that elevated Lp(a) was a risk factor for stroke, with the strongest evidence coming from prospective cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In the two available meta-analyses, the range of risk comparing the highest to the lowest tertiles was 1.10 to 1.22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,45</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review including six studies that evaluated ischemic stroke as an outcome, the relative risk was 2.14 (95% CI 1.85-2.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lp(a) may also play a role in the development of target-organ damage in patients with primary hypertension (formerly called &ldquo;essential&rdquo; hypertension). In one study, 277 patients with untreated hypertension were compared with 102 healthy controls. Lp(a) levels were the best predictor of target-organ damage involving the kidney, heart, and arterial wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipoprotein-a-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
