(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is hypothesized that SCD is related, at least in part, to excess vascular calcification (VC), particularly in the form of extensive coronary artery calcification (CAC) affecting epicardial and smaller arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

Risk factors, epidemiology, and clinical implications of VC in renal disease are discussed separately.

By comparison, veins hardly ever undergo calcification, unless injured or arterialized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As examples, calcification associated with arteriolization may occur after coronary artery bypass grafting or arteriovenous fistula formation or in the pulmonary arterial tree of patients with pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Among CKD patients, there are two types of VC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medial calcification</strong> &ndash; Medial calcification is due in part to increased serum calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D concentrations. In contrast to intimal calcification, medial calcification is not associated with either inflammation or lipid deposition. Medial calcification decreases vascular distensibility, leading to increased vessel stiffness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intimal calcification</strong> &ndash; Intimal calcification is the result of an inflammatory process and is a manifestation of advanced atherosclerosis and occlusive vascular disease. Like medial calcification, intimal calcification can stiffen blood vessels; intimal calcification, however, is also associated with marked reduction in endothelial function and reactivity.</p><p/><p>Both types of calcification may be observed in some vessels (such as coronary arteries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Both intimal and medial calcification have been associated with increased mortality, although intimal calcification has been more closely associated with cardiovascular events and cardiovascular-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, despite this association, it is not certain that VC contributes directly to cardiovascular events and mortality. Most of the promoting factors for the development and progression of VC are the same ones that directly damage endothelium and smooth muscle in vessels. Some believe that intimal calcification may actually stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and reduce the risk of acute plaque rupture, though this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VC is an active process that closely resembles ossification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Osteogenic proteins, such as osteocalcin, osteonectin, alkaline phosphatase, and collagen-I, are increased in the calcified vessel wall and promote differentiation of smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].
