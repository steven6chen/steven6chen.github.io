Approximately 40 to 50 percent of CKD patients have fasting triglyceride levels &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Hypertriglyceridemia among CKD patients is caused by defective clearance and reductions in the activity of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>]. Defective clearance results from alterations in the composition of circulating triglycerides, which become enriched with lipase-inhibiting apolipoprotein C-III, and reductions in the activity of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>]. Other potential contributors to decreased triglyceride clearance include secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] and retention of circulating inhibitors of lipoprotein lipase, such as pre-beta-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In other CKD patients, the serum cholesterol concentration is normal or low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>An increased low-density lipoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">(LDL)-/HDL-cholesterol</span> ratio is commonly observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The increased ratio is due to both a modest decrease in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and increased LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; approximately 10 to 45 percent of CKD patients have LDL-C levels &gt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].</p><p>The composition of HDL particles may be different among CKD patients. As an example, there is downregulation of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, which results in reduced esterification of cholesterol and therefore reduced reverse cholesterol transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This may contribute to atherosclerosis by burdening the peripheral vasculature with excess cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There may also be a decrease in the antioxidant properties of HDL particles and an increase in the oxidative modification of LDL particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of elevated cholesterol concentrations among CKD patients is not clear. This is different from non-CKD patients. Whereas in non-CKD patients, a higher serum total cholesterol progressively increases the risk of coronary disease and cardiovascular death, among CKD patients, the association between LDL-C and coronary risk tends to diminish as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and some studies have found no association between lipid levels and mortality among CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

Among patients with markedly abnormal values who may require titration of medication, we check lipids more frequently (ie, every three to six months). The KDIGO guidelines state that routine follow-up monitoring of lipids in patients taking medication is not necessary, but may be useful for detection of nonadherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1754469757\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4099188105\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We select patients for statin treatment based on age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and other cardiovascular risk factors.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Dietary modification may be helpful for hypertriglyceridemia associated with CKD. We agree with the 2013 KDIGO and NKF-KDOQI guidelines that therapeutic lifestyle changes be advised among patients with fasting triglyceride levels &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. Such lifestyle changes include dietary modification, weight reduction, increased physical activity, reduction in alcohol intake, and treatment of hyperglycemia, if present. Caution should be exercised in dietary modifications to avoid malnutrition, which may be present in CKD patients; the avoidance of malnutrition is often a higher priority in such patients.</p><p>In general, we agree with the 2013 KDIGO and NKF-KDOQI workgroup recommendations that fibrates not be used concurrently with statins among CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. Among CKD patients, fibrates are more likely to have side effects, particularly when given concurrently with statins.</p><p>However, CKD patients who have serum total triglycerides &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> despite the nonpharmacologic interventions listed above may require specific treatment of triglycerides in order to prevent pancreatitis and possibly reduce cardiovascular risk. For such patients, fibrates, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemfibrozil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemfibrozil</a>, are most effective in lowering serum triglyceride levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Such patients should only be treated by clinicians with expertise in lipid disorders.</p><p>While fibrates appear to lower the risk of cardiovascular events in CKD patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD), they appear to have no effect on total mortality and may worsen renal function. The Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) evaluated the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemfibrozil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemfibrozil</a> in patients with established CHD and an HDL-C &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Within this cohort of 2531 people, there were 1046 men who had mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction, defined as calculated creatinine clearance between 30 and 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (638, 406, and 2 patients with creatinine clearances of 60 to 75, 30 to 59.9, and &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among these patients, gemfibrozil therapy lowered the risk of the primary endpoint of coronary death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (18.2 versus 24.3 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.96). However, gemfibrozil therapy had no effect on total mortality (HR 1.03) and was associated with a significant decline in renal function.</p><p>In addition, particularly in patients also treated with a statin, fibrates may lead to muscle injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events#H107312713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;, section on 'Concurrent drug therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In view of the benefits provided by statin therapy described above, for most patients, the potential harm associated with the addition of fibrates to specifically lower triglycerides may outweigh the possible benefit provided by cardiovascular risk reduction.</p><p>There are no studies that have specifically examined pharmacotherapy for hypertriglyceridemia among CKD patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipid abnormalities are common in patients with all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertriglyceridemia is the primary lipid abnormality among CKD patients, although abnormalities in cholesterol and apolipoprotein also occur. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Common lipid abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen all CKD patients with a lipid panel that includes total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Among most patients, regardless of whether they are treated with statins or not, we re-check lipids annually. Among patients with markedly abnormal values who may require titration of medication, we check lipids more frequently (ie, every three to six months). (See <a href=\"#H1914506959\" class=\"local\">'Screening and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We select patients for statin treatment based on age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and other cardiovascular risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H4099188105\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are &ge;50 years of age, have an eGFR &lt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and are not on dialysis, we recommend treatment with statins, regardless of absence or presence of other cardiovascular risk factors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Such patients have been shown to be at significantly higher cardiovascular risk compared with the non-CKD population, and major cardiovascular events are reduced by statin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2487584272\" class=\"local\">'Evidence in support of treatment with statins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patient who are &ge;50 years of age, have eGFR 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73, and are not on dialysis, we suggest treatment with statins, even in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, some clinicians may elect not to treat some patients with only mildly reduced eGFR (ie, 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>), because of a lower overall baseline risk due to the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2487584272\" class=\"local\">'Evidence in support of treatment with statins'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Statin therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The treatment of patients who are &lt;50 years of age and have an eGFR&lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 but do <strong>not </strong>have any other cardiovascular risk factors is not clear. We and other clinicians individualize therapy with statins after a discussion with the patient of cardiovascular risk and possible statin-mediated risk reduction. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2487584272\" class=\"local\">'Evidence in support of treatment with statins'</a> above.)<br/><br/>The treatment of patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors is discussed elsewhere.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes should be advised among patients with fasting triglyceride levels &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Such lifestyle changes include dietary modification, weight reduction, increased physical activity, reduction in alcohol intake, and treatment of hyperglycemia, if present.

While fibrate therapy appears to lower the risk of cardiovascular events in CKD patients who have known coronary heart disease (CHD), they appear to have no effect of total mortality, may worsen renal function, and, particularly in patients also treated with a statin, lead to muscle injury. However, some would favor individualizing therapy in this population, and this is best done in conjunction with an expert on lipid-lowering therapies.
