In the clinical arena, this most often occurs when there is an inability to intubate the patient's trachea (even after only a single failed attempt) <strong>and</strong> an inability to ventilate the patient adequately with a bag and mask to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations above 90 percent. This is the &quot;can't intubate, can't oxygenate&quot; (CICO) type of failed airway. The term &quot;failed airway&quot;, therefore is applied at any point at which the primary airway management technique is unsuccessful, and alternative techniques are not able to maintain oxygenation. When this situation arises during emergency airway management, the clinician must take effective action immediately to avoid oxygen desaturation with resultant cerebral hypoxia.</p><p>A second form of failed airway has been defined for emergency intubation, and exists when there have been three failed attempts to intubate by an experienced operator, even when bag and mask ventilation is capable of maintaining adequate oxyhemoglobin saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is the &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can</strong> oxygenate&quot; type of failed airway. In this scenario, the clinician must plan to use alternative strategies to place a tracheal tube or ensure continued gas exchange; the latter is often accomplished through the placement of an extraglottic device.</p><p>A failed airway can arise during a rapid sequence intubation, during management of a difficult airway, or during management of a crash airway. Regardless of the circumstances leading to the airway failure, a deliberate approach must be used to ensure that oxygenation is preserved, and that the airway is ultimately secured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF THE FAILED AIRWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of the failed airway, as defined above, is not known for emergency department (ED) airway management, nor for patients undergoing anesthesia in the operating room. Analysis of over 17,000 ED intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] in the National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR III) found that rapid sequence intubation is successful in three or fewer attempts in over 98 percent of cases for which it is the first method chosen, and that rescue surgical cricothyrotomy (also called cricothyroidotomy) is required in approximately 0.3 percent of all emergency intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is likely that the incidence of failed airway, particularly of the can't intubate, <strong>can</strong> ventilate type, is higher than this in general community practice, as the NEAR sites were mostly academic medical centers. Regardless of the incidence, the failed airway represents a potential catastrophe if not managed effectively. The failed airway scenario is best avoided by a systematic preintubation evaluation of patients for difficult airway attributes and thorough planning for the intubation, including planning for failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The significance of this pre-intubation evaluation was underlined by a study performed in the United Kingdom in 2010. The National Audit Project 4 (NAP4) identified a higher likelihood of adverse outcome (permanent brain injury or death) for emergency department and intensive care unit (ICU) intubations when compared to those occurring in the operating room (OR). The investigators attributed this to various factors, most notably failure to perform adequate pre-intubation assessment to identify at-risk patients, and failure to use capnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The emergent nature of the intubations in the ED and ICU likely contributed as well. Other studies have identified increased risk of adverse events with an increasing number of attempts required to achieve intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The NEAR III investigators found an increasing use of video laryngoscopy in the later years of their 10-year study period and a decreasing incidence of airway failure and cricothyrotomy, suggesting that optimizing laryngeal view by using video laryngoscopy may increase success and decrease the likelihood of a failed airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE FAILED AIRWAY ALGORITHM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351136572\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of algorithm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a failed airway occurs, the failed airway algorithm provides a series of actions to guide management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The critical question is whether adequate oxygenation (ie, oxyhemoglobin saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] above 90 percent or stable in the high 80s) can be maintained. If oxygenation is adequate, there is time to plan a series of actions to manage the airway; if the patient's oxygenation cannot be maintained, immediate rescue by (usually) cricothyrotomy is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If time permits, there are a number of alternative or rescue devices that can be used when direct laryngoscopy has failed. In some cases, the rescue airway may provide a definitive airway, with a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) in the trachea. If the airway is secured by a cuffed ETT, the airway is considered to be managed, and general resuscitation continues. If adequate oxygenation and ventilation are achieved, but the airway is not protected by a cuffed ETT in the trachea, resuscitation can continue, but arrangements must be made to establish a definitive airway at the earliest appropriate opportunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with the difficult airway algorithm, the response to the failed airway can be thought of as a series of discrete steps. Each of these steps is described in detail below. Assistance in the form of personnel, equipment, or airway devices, should be obtained as needed at the moment the failed airway is recognized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there time?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the outset, the key determination is whether the patient is being adequately oxygenated (ie, oxyhemoglobin saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] above 90 percent or stable in the high 80s). If so, there is time to create and execute a deliberate rescue plan, perhaps customized to the patient's particular circumstances. This is the &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can</strong> oxygenate&quot; scenario.</p><p>If the patient cannot be oxygenated adequately with a bag and mask, despite use of optimal technique (ie, can't intubate, <strong>can't</strong> oxygenate), immediate cricothyrotomy is indicated. Although an alternative airway device might rescue the patient without cricothyrotomy, the extremely brief time before cerebral hypoxia ensues argues for immediate surgical intervention. Attempts to establish an alternative airway, if unsuccessful, may delay the initiation of cricothyrotomy leading to hypoxic brain injury. Thus, we equate &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can't</strong> oxygenate&quot; with cricothyrotomy in the emergency setting.</p><p>There is one important, optional modification to this approach. Placement of a single &quot;best&quot; alternative device, usually an extraglottic airway (eg, Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) or King LT Airway) can be attempted in parallel with preparations for the surgical airway. If the operator is able to insert an extraglottic airway and attempt ventilation, while a second clinician simultaneously prepares for a cricothyrotomy, then valuable time is not lost if ventilation using the extraglottic device is unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, a single operator might make one attempt with an extraglottic device, then proceed directly to cricothyrotomy if oxygenation is not promptly achieved. This approach involves a single attempt using a single &quot;go to&quot; device, and cannot delay significantly the initiation of cricothyrotomy if ventilation is not achieved immediately. Whether this single, parallel rescue maneuver is attempted but unsuccessful or not attempted, the primary rescue technique is cricothyrotomy. The performance of cricothyrotomy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVE AIRWAY DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to difficult airway management, during which placement of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) in the trachea is the goal, the initial objective for failed airway management is to provide adequate oxygenation sufficient to support the patient until a definitive airway can be achieved. So long as the patient is adequately oxygenated using a bag and mask, the clinician may use any of several alternatives to direct laryngoscopy to rescue the failed airway. The devices briefly described below are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">List of devices</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video laryngoscopes &ndash; We recommend a video laryngoscope as the primary intubating device for most intubations. However, if a conventional direct laryngoscope was used instead, then a video laryngoscope can be considered as a first rescue device. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Video laryngoscopes (eg, Storz C-MAC, Glidescope, KingVision) resemble a conventional laryngoscope with a video camera on the blade that generally provides an excellent view of the glottis, without the need to align the airway axes to achieve a direct view from outside the patient's mouth. These devices function well with the patient in the neutral position, and obstacles to conventional laryngoscopy, such as limited mouth opening or a large tongue, generally do not present a problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H1753778712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fiberoptic or video stylet &ndash; There are several rigid or semirigid fiberoptic and video stylets available (eg, Clarus Video System, Shikani Optical Stylet [SOS]). These stylets have fiberoptic or video viewers at their distal tip and are inserted through the ETT. The image generated can be used to guide the ETT between the vocal cords without need of a conventional laryngoscope. These devices are uncommon in emergency medicine practice but can be useful rescue tools provided there is adequate clinician comfort and expertise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H418683882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Optical stylets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;, section on 'Stylets'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optical devices &ndash; Various optical devices are available for intubation of the failed airway or as an alternative to direct laryngoscopy. The best studied of these is the AirTraq, a periscope-like device that uses prisms and mirrors to provide an indirect view of the glottis, in some ways mimicking a video laryngoscope, but with a significantly inferior image of the glottis. The AirTraq incorporates a channel for the ETT, which is advanced when the glottis is properly sighted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H1436099200\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Channelled VL'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;, section on 'Optical laryngoscopes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraglottic airway &ndash; Various laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) are available, some specifically designed to facilitate subsequent intubation and some intended strictly as ventilatory devices in their own right. A second type of extraglottic airway is inserted into the esophageal inlet and has two balloons that are inflated to occlude both the esophagus and the pharynx thereby permitting sidestream ventilation of the trachea. Examples include the Combitube and King LT airways. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible bronchoscope &ndash; The flexible bronchoscope, preferably an intubating bronchoscope, provides access to the glottis without having to correct for the various angles of the oropharynx, as is required for direct laryngoscopy. Intubation can be achieved nasally or orally, but by either route, attempts can be time-consuming, making this device more appropriate for a planned approach to certain difficult airways, rather than for the rescue of a failed airway. Attempts using the flexible bronchoscope may have to be abbreviated or abandoned because of the difficulty maintaining oxygenation during flexible endoscopic airway procedures. Flexible bronchoscopes require training and practice, but have high success rates when time permits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Others, such as the extraglottic airways, provide for ventilation and oxygenation, but do not protect the airway. If one of the nonprotective devices has been used, resuscitation can proceed, but a plan must be initiated to secure the airway at the earliest opportunity. If at any time oxygenation fails, and the patient reverts to a &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can't</strong> oxygenate&quot; situation, cricothyrotomy remains the rescue technique of first resort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A failed airway exists at any time during an attempt at endotracheal intubation when there is an inability to intubate the patient (even with a single attempt) and an inability to oxygenate the patient adequately using a bag and mask or an extraglottic device (ie, maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations [SpO<sub>2</sub>] above 90 percent or stable in the high 80s). This is the &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can't</strong> oxygenate&quot; type of failed airway. A failed airway also exists when there have been three failed attempts to intubate by an experienced operator, even when ventilation with a bag and mask or an extraglottic device maintains adequate SpO<sub>2</sub>. This is the &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can</strong> oxygenate&quot; type of failed airway. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that cricothyrotomy be used as the primary rescue maneuver for the &quot;can't intubate, <strong>can't</strong> oxygenate&quot; failed airway (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Cricothyrotomy has a high success rate and relatively low complication rate, and can be performed using open surgical technique or a Seldinger method.
