Occasionally they cause clinically significant infections, particularly in the setting of shoulder surgery, orthopedic hardware, endovascular devices, and cerebrospinal shunts. It can be difficult to determine whether positive culture results for cutibacteria reflect contamination or true infection.</p><p>Infections with <em>Cutibacterium</em> species can be classified into three categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne in teenagers and young adults (when caused by <em>C. acnes</em>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical wound infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive deep seated infections, usually in the setting of implantable devices (eg, pacemakers, shunts, etc)</p><p/><p>This topic discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of invasive <em>Cutibacterium</em> infections in patients with implantable devices. Issues related to acne are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutibacteria are normally present on human skin and in sebaceous glands and hair follicles; they can also be recovered from the conjunctiva, external ear, nasopharynx, oral cavity, and genitourinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, <em>C. acnes</em> is a common environmental surface contaminant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Therefore, it is often difficult to determine whether positive culture results for cutibacteria reflect contamination or true infection.</p><p><em>Cutibacterium</em> species are members of the Actinobacteria class of microorganisms. They are slow-growing, gram-positive, nonmotile, anaerobic bacilli of relatively low virulence. The organisms can occur singly, in pairs, or in groups. They produce lactic, propionic, and acetic acids, and, unlike most other anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, they are catalase positive. These organisms may be difficult to identify initially because of their slow growth, especially in clinical specimens that also contain other common, readily recovered organisms. Therefore, identification of cutibacteria may be overlooked if cultures are not rechecked or if cultures are discarded after three to five days of incubation. Cutibacteria are more likely to represent true pathogens if they are isolated in pure culture from multiple specimens (particularly in the setting of consistent Gram stain morphology between specimens) or from a deep intraoperative specimen. One study found that the time to positive culture is shorter among patients with true infection group than among those with probable contamination (5 days versus 9 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A polymerase chain reaction&ndash;restriction fragment length polymorphism assay has been used in surgical biopsy specimens with a turnaround time of 24 hours and with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of <em>C. acnes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most clinical infections due to <em>Cutibacterium</em> are due to <em>C. acnes</em>; other less common species of possible clinical significance include <em>C. granulosum</em>, <em>C. avidum</em>, and <em>C. propionicum</em>. However, most laboratories do not routinely speciate cutibacterial species. Clinical suspicion for infection should prompt request for speciation of the organism if available from a local microbiology laboratory and if the significance of an isolate is questionable. In the absence of clinical signs of infection, the relevance of unexpected positive cultures during orthopedic surgeries is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one study including 117 primary shoulder surgical procedures without signs of infection, there was at least one positive pericapsular tissue culture after prolonged incubation in 18 percent of cases, with most cultures growing <em>C. acnes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>C. acnes</em> is thought to be a commensal in deeper tissue layers and that some of these positive cultures may represent culture contamination and a false-positive result. Therefore, the diagnosis of true low-grade infection is quite challenging. A combination of clinical, microbiologic, and histopathologic evidence is important.</p><p><em>C. acnes</em> is of relatively low virulence but is capable of adherence and biofilm formation; this characteristic plays an important role in pathogenesis of infection due to this organism. In the majority of patients with <em>Cutibacterium </em>prosthetic joint infections, infiltration of the glycocalyx with adherence to the implant surface has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In one report, <em>C. acnes</em> was associated with chronic low-grade infection of implanted biomaterials as frequently as <em>Staphylococcus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <em>C. acnes</em> strains exhibiting the hemolytic phenotype appear to be more pathogenic, whereas nonhemolytic strains are more likely to represent contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Cutibacterium</em> infections are usually characterized by a paucity of classical symptoms of infection or inflammation. Invasive <em>Cutibacterium</em> infection typically occurs in the setting of prior surgery. Given the low virulence of cutibacteria, infections with these organisms are usually indolent. In some cases, clinical manifestations may be delayed for months and, rarely, for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><em>C. acnes</em> tends to inhabit the deep crevices of the skin where surgical antiseptic solutions may penetrate poorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

In late presentations, these findings may be absent; in such cases, manifestations may include pain, joint stiffness, or prosthesis dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Some patients who developed loosened prostheses &ge;2 years after implantation have positive cultures with <em>Cutibacterium</em> species when the hardware is removed. In such cases, it may be impossible to determine if the positive cultures represent true infection or contamination secondary to the removal and processing of samples for culture.</p><p>Risk factors for <em>C. acnes</em> orthopedic infection include prolonged surgery, multiple surgeries, and male gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/2,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,17</a>].

Men may be at increased risk for cutibacteria infection because they have more sebaceous glands and hair follicles than women. Neither perioperative topical antisepsis nor intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> is effective in eliminating <em>C. acnes</em> colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Cutibacteria have been implicated in a variety of orthopedic infections, including prosthetic joint infection (3.6 to 5.7 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/15,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34</a>], native joint infection following arthroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/22,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,35,36</a>], and vertebral osteomyelitis following spine surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/23,30,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,30,37-40</a>].</p><p>Cutibacteria appear to have greater predilection for infection involving the shoulder joint than other joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/7,12,22,35,36,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,22,35,36,41,42</a>]. This may be related to the observation that <em>C. acnes</em> colonization rates for the shoulder appear to be greater than colonization of the knee or hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In general, the infection rate is 0.9 to 1.9 percent following implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/12,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,44,45</a>]. Infections present with pain and stiffness of the shoulder, followed by local swelling or erythema. A peculiar bruising appearance along the surgical incision should raise suspicion for <em>Cutibacterium</em> infection of shoulder prostheses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56978 \">picture 1</a>). In one series including 17 shoulder prosthetic joint infections caused by <em>C. acnes</em>, the time to infection after surgery was &lt;3 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Endovascular infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Cutibacterium</em> may cause infections of endovascular devices such as prosthetic valves, pacemakers, and defibrillators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/24,25,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,46</a>]. Infection can be divided into local infection (pocket infection) and devic-related bloodstream infections, including device-related endocarditis. Endocarditis caused by <em>C. acnes</em> has been associated with both native and prosthetic valves but more often develops on valve prostheses, most commonly the aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

The mortality rate is 15 to 27 percent due to valvular and perivalvular destruction associated with delayed diagnosis of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>In one series of 15 cases of <em>Cutibacterium</em> endocarditis, 13 patients had a prosthetic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cutibacterium-formerly-propionibacterium-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The mean onset of infection was four years following surgery.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, cutibacteria are not usually pathogenic. Therefore, it can be difficult to determine whether positive culture results for cutibacteria reflect contamination or true infection. Cutibacteria are more likely to represent a true pathogen if isolated in pure culture from multiple specimens (particularly when the morphology on Gram stain is consistent) or from a deep intraoperative specimen. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutibacteria are of relatively low virulence but capable of adherence and biofilm formation; this characteristic plays an important role in the pathogenesis of infection due to this organism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Cutibacterium</em> infections are usually indolent and clinical manifestations may be delayed for months or, rarely, years. In addition, <em>Cutibacterium</em> infections are usually characterized by a paucity of classical symptoms of infection or inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the role of biofilm formation in the pathogenesis of <em>Cutibacterium</em> infection, eradication of <em>Cutibacterium</em> infections is difficult without device removal. We suggest hardware removal except when this intervention would result in joint or spine instability (in the case of orthopedic infections) or when the overall condition of the patient makes the procedure unsafe (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hardware removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice and duration of antibiotic therapy should be individualized depending on the clinical circumstances. In general, we suggest parenteral penicillin for initial management of invasive <em>Cutibacterium</em> infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
