The three major clinical patterns are streaks and swirls following the Blaschko lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57219 \">figure 1</a>), a segmental or &quot;checkerboard&quot; distribution, and a phylloid (leaf-like) arrangement.</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pigmentary mosaicism.

Hypomelanosis of Ito (HOI) and linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH) generally refer to hypo- and hyperpigmentation along the Blaschko lines, respectively. Extracutaneous manifestations occur in a minority of individuals with these skin findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, HOI series from pediatric neurology centers describe high frequencies of neurologic abnormalities, which reflect an obvious referral bias, and some authors limit the diagnosis of HOI to patients with extracutaneous abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>To avoid unnecessary concern based upon these uses of the HOI appellation and to acknowledge the similar nature of LWNH, alternative descriptive names such as linear nevoid <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo-/hyperpigmentation</span> (used herein) and Blaschkoid dyspigmentation have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Of note, the term &quot;incontinentia pigmenti achromians&quot; that was originally coined by Ito for linear nevoid hypopigmentation is no longer used to avoid confusion with incontinentia pigmenti, a completely separate condition.</p><p>Multiple terms have also been utilized for pigmentary mosaicism in a checkerboard pattern, including segmental nevus depigmentosus, segmental pigmentation disorder (used herein), and flag-like hypo- or hypermelanotic nevus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Cutis tricolor refers to patterned hypo- and hyperpigmentation in a background of skin with an intermediate level of pigmentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821151924\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of pigmentary mosaicism is unknown. Studies in Hispanic children have found that hypomelanosis of Ito (HOI), defined as extensive linear or patchy hypopigmentation (affecting &ge;3 body regions) with associated extracutaneous findings, was present in approximately 1 of 8000 general pediatric outpatients and 1 of 800 pediatric dermatology outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Pigmentary mosaicism without associated extracutaneous findings may not come to medical attention, especially when relatively subtle or not extensive, and is likely underreported in the literature. Segmental pigmentation disorder is thought to be relatively common, with one study estimating its presence in approximately 1 of 250 Israeli pediatric dermatology outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Pigmentary mosaicism has no clear sex predilection and is almost always sporadic, with rare reports of possible familial occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Although it can affect individuals of any ethnic background, pigmentary mosaicism is often more apparent in those with darkly pigmented or tanned skin. The areas of patterned hypo- or hyperpigmentation may be noticed at birth or become evident during the first few years of life. Delayed presentation is common in fair-skinned individuals, and hypopigmentation may go unnoticed until the contrast with the surrounding skin is accentuated following sun exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3000146059\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosaicism refers to an organism composed of at least two genetically different cell populations that originate from a homogeneous zygote. Pigmentary mosaicism results from a postzygotic mutation or other genetic change that alters the pigment production potential of daughter cells destined to be located in the skin. If daughter cells also migrate to other organs (eg, central nervous system, musculoskeletal system) and the genetic change has local detrimental effects, extracutaneous manifestations may occur. The extent of involvement of the skin (and potentially of other organs) is thought to be greater when the causal genetic event occurred earlier during the embryogenesis.</p><p>Multiple types of mosaic cytogenetic abnormalities have been found to underlie linear nevoid <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo-/hyperpigmentation,</span> including numerical (eg, trisomy 18 or 20, triploidy) and structural (eg, deletions, duplications, translocations) chromosomal aberrations. Alterations in nearly every chromosome have been reported to cause pigmentary mosaicism. However, approximately 90 percent of the cytogenetic abnormalities involve loci of genes known to be involved in skin pigmentation, with more than 50 different pigmentary genes shown to be implicated in at least one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Smaller-scale mutations (eg, point mutations) in a specific gene have less often been implicated. For example, asymmetric megalencephaly with polymicrogyria associated with nevoid hypo- and hyperpigmentation has been associated with a mosaic point mutation in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The types of genetic changes that cause segmental pigmentation disorder remain to be determined. By contrast, phylloid hypomelanosis is a distinct clinicogenetic entity caused by mosaic trisomy (or occasionally tetrasomy) 13q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are also rare reports of phylloid hypermelanosis, which has been linked to several different chromosomal aberrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52815050\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pigmentary mosaicism present with hypo- or hyperpigmentation along Blaschko lines or in a checkerboard pattern. The use of a Wood's lamp may help to better delineate the affected areas when the hypo- or hyperpigmentation is subtle. Some patients have a combination of linear and segmental hypo- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperpigmentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044225\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Wood's lamp examination (black light)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959610377\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear nevoid hypo-/hyperpigmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with linear nevoid hypo- or hyperpigmentation, streaks and swirls of hypo- or hyperpigmentation following Blaschko lines can occur anywhere on the body, forming V-shapes on the central back, S-shapes on the anterior trunk, and long, narrow bands on the extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110210%7EDERM%2F110211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110210 graphicRef110211 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Involvement may be unilateral or bilateral, localized or widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When extensive, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the lighter or darker skin represents the background color (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110212 \">picture 2</a>). Occasionally, both hypo- and hyperpigmented streaks are present in different areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>]. Scalp involvement can lead to spiral bands of lighter or darker hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There have been a few reports of associated hypohidrosis or separate streaks of Blaschko-linear hypertrichosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,8,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3092955026\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of extracutaneous manifestations in patients with linear nevoid <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo-/hyperpigmentation</span> is unknown. Older series from pediatric neurology centers reported central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities in over 80 percent of patients with linear nevoid hypopigmentation, but these findings are not generalizable due to a strong referral bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Series from pediatric dermatology referral centers have documented a 15 to 30 percent prevalence of extracutaneous findings in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Considering that healthy children without extensive skin involvement would be less likely to see a subspecialized pediatric dermatologist, the frequency is probably even lower. Of note, many experts recommend reserving the term hypomelanosis of Ito for patients with linear nevoid hypo- or hyperpigmentation associated with extracutaneous manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,20</a>].</p><p>Extracutaneous involvement most commonly affects the CNS and musculoskeletal system. Signs and symptoms usually arise during infancy, but milder manifestations occasionally have a later onset. Developmental delay and seizures are the most frequent clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/1,2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,21</a>]. Associated musculoskeletal anomalies have included hemihyperplasia or hemihypoplasia, scoliosis, coarse facies, and abnormal digits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. </p><p>Ocular abnormalities and congenital heart disease have been reported in a small minority of affected individuals, with variable manifestations that reflect the diversity of the underlying genetic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. For example, Pallister-Killian syndrome due to mosaic tetrasomy 12p features linear nevoid hypo- or hyperpigmentation together with craniofacial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, hypotonia, seizures, and intellectual disability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities#H11375682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;, section on '47,+i(12p)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3732874614\"><span class=\"h2\">Segmental pigmentation disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with segmental pigmentation disorder, hypo- or hyperpigmented patches have a segmental pattern that has been referred to as block-like, flag-like, or resembling a checkerboard (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110214\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110214 \">picture 3</a>). Any site can be affected, but the trunk is favored. Midline demarcation is more often present ventrally (approximately 80 percent of cases) than dorsally; lesions tend to be less well-defined laterally and occasionally extend past the midline by a few centimeters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The shape is frequently quadrangular, and the margins may be serrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Segmental pigmentation disorder is not usually associated with extracutaneous abnormalities. Affected areas occasionally develop multiple superimposed lentigines or melanocytic nevi, including Spitz nevi. If the background patch is hyperpigmented, this leads to a diagnosis of speckled lentiginous nevus (nevus spilus). (See <a href=\"#H760887260\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Segmental hyperpigmentation sometimes coexists with a light red-pink capillary malformation; this association is referred to as phacomatosis melanorosea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-lesions-in-the-newborn#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular lesions in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202219482\"><span class=\"h2\">Phylloid hypomelanosis and hypermelanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phylloid pattern is composed of leaf-like, pear-shaped, and oblong lesions in an arrangement reminiscent of a floral ornament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110216\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110216 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>Phylloid hypomelanosis is a distinct clinicogenetic entity associated with mosaic abnormalities of chromosome 13 (trisomy and tetrasomy 13q). It presents with additional cutaneous and extracutaneous features, including telangiectatic macules, thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, low frontal hairline, seizures, intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, conductive hearing loss, colobomas, and skeletal defects that often involve the digits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. </p><p>Only a few cases of phylloid hypermelanosis have been reported, with variable extracutaneous manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. Mosaic abnormalities of chromosome 13 have been documented in some but not all cases of phylloid hypermelanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1967156656\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypopigmented lesions have a normal or reduced number of melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Hyperpigmented lesions typically show increased pigmentation in the basal layer of the epidermis and a normal or slightly increased number of melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4275266855\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of the various types of pigmentary mosaicism is made clinically. Although the histopathologic findings are nonspecific, a skin biopsy is occasionally helpful in excluding alternative diagnoses when the clinical findings are atypical. (See <a href=\"#H760887260\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A thorough history and physical examination should be performed to assess for extracutaneous involvement, with further evaluation directed by any abnormal findings. Neurodevelopmental progress should be followed by the child's pediatrician, with additional intervention if needed.</p><p>Identification of the underlying genetic alteration does not usually affect the management of patients with pigmentary mosaicism. However, genetic analysis should be considered in children with extracutaneous abnormalities, especially when it may provide better understanding of the overall diagnosis. Karyotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes reveals mosaic chromosomal abnormalities in up to one-third of patients with linear nevoid hypopigmentation; in an additional fourth of affected individuals, chromosomal abnormalities can be detected by genetic analysis of lesional skin fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Because Blaschko lines reflect pathways of ectodermal<em> </em>cell migration during embryonic development, the mosaic abnormality may be confined to epidermal cells. Although analysis of lesional keratinocytes or melanocytes rather than fibroblasts would likely be of higher yield, keratinocyte and melanocyte cultures are not routinely performed at most cytogenetic laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>More sensitive techniques such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) may also be useful in identifying submicroscopic genetic abnormalities (eg, microdeletions, microduplications) that are not detected with conventional cytogenetic methods. Analysis of specific genes or whole <span class=\"nowrap\">exome/genome</span> sequencing utilizing lesional samples may be helpful in patients with extracutaneous manifestations suggestive of a particular diagnosis or type of disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmentary-mosaicism-hypomelanosis-of-ito/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760887260\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several conditions can present with hypo- or hyperpigmentation along Blaschko lines or in a checkerboard pattern.
