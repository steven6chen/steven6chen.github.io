Histologic examination of lymph nodes is the most accurate method for assessing lymph node metastasis. Axillary dissection has traditionally been used in breast surgery to obtain lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection in many patients with early breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-metastatic-breast-cancer#H1064914687\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognostic versus predictive factors'</a>.)</p><p>Indications for and outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy will be reviewed here. The technique of sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with breast cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1816667\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE AXILLA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation of axillary lymph nodes separates patients into two categories: patients with clinically positive nodes undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and patients with clinically negative nodes undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). </p><p>It is essential that patients receive adequate evaluation of the axilla prior to surgery. Patients who have been suboptimally examined for clinically involved nodes before surgery are at a greater risk for recurrence. The applicability of SLNB is based on trials that only included clinically node-negative patients. ALND remains the standard of care for patients with clinically positive nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817748\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpable node</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a palpably enlarged, firm mobile lymph node who elect not to undergo preoperative biopsy should undergo ALND with their primary breast procedure. Those who do elect to have preoperative biopsy may undergo core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the palpable lymph nodes for pathologic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Patients who have biopsy-confirmed nodal disease should undergo ALND for axillary clearance. </p><p>SLNB with simultaneous removal of the palpable node(s) is an acceptable option for staging these patients with palpable nodes in whom the preoperative biopsy does not confirm metastatic disease. If subsequent pathologic evaluation of the palpable node(s) demonstrates metastatic disease, the patient should be considered clinically node-positive when deciding how to further manage the remaining axillary nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817754\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal node on imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When clinical examination alone is suboptimal (eg, in obese patients), patients may benefit from axillary imaging. Axillary ultrasound is an effective screening method for detecting nonpalpable nodal metastasis in patients with invasive breast cancer. </p><p>In one study of 653 consecutive patients, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration diagnosed axillary disease in 23 percent of patients, thereby negating a second operation in 150 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the efficacy of ultrasound-guided biopsy can vary between centers because the accuracy of ultrasound examination is operator dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of women with suspected breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>). As there are no current guidelines on which patients benefit most from axillary ultrasound evaluation for metastatic disease, it is recommended that each institution develop its own guidelines in a multidisciplinary fashion.</p><p>Patients with abnormal axillary lymph nodes by imaging have a higher risk of having multiple metastatic lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such patients should undergo image-guided core biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the suspicious node and, if positive, an ALND for axillary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When only one or two suspicious nodes are detected by imaging and one is confirmed positive by biopsy, SLNB remains an option. Each institution should develop its own guidelines for this situation with multidisciplinary input.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1509868350\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to assess axillary lymph nodes in patients with early breast cancer (T1 or T2) who do not have clinically positive nodes and in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) when mastectomy is performed. These recommendations are consistent with those made by the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168323\"><span class=\"h3\">Early breast cancer with clinically negative node</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLNB should be performed in women with clinically node-negative early breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For these patients, SLNB is a method of staging the axilla with less morbidity than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168329\"><span class=\"h3\">DCIS with planned mastectomy or suspicious features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with DCIS do <strong>not</strong> require assessment of the axillary nodes, because DCIS is not invasive cancer and does not metastasize. However, two groups of women undergoing breast surgery for DCIS may benefit from SLNB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268704\"><span class=\"h4\">DCIS with planned mastectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLNB should be performed in all patient with DCIS undergoing total mastectomy. The technique of SLNB involves injecting radiolabeled tracer into the breast parenchyma near the area of DCIS or, alternatively, in a periareolar location. After a total mastectomy, the lymphatic drainage pattern will be permanently altered, making it impossible to accurately perform SLNB at a later date if invasive cancer is found unexpectedly in the mastectomy specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268710\"><span class=\"h4\">DCIS with suspicious features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some also recommend SLNB to patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery for DCIS clinically suspected of harboring invasive cancer, including DCIS larger than 5 cm and DCIS with a palpable mass. Offering SLNB with breast-conserving surgery to DCIS patients who have a high clinical or pathological suspicion of synchronous invasive cancer may spare them the inconvenience of a second operation.</p><p>This practice, however, is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Invasive carcinoma has only been reported in 10 to 20 percent of excision specimens following a biopsy diagnosis of DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, most women will not have any invasive disease on final pathology. For them, omitting SLNB at the time of their breast-conserving surgery eliminates any perioperative morbidity associated with SLNB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. If invasive breast cancer is identified after a breast-conserving surgery is performed for DCIS, SLNB can be performed as a second procedure to stage the axilla. Disease stage and subsequent axillary management may change for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Locally advanced breast cancer is a relative contraindication for SLNB. Certain large tumors (eg, T3) may be amenable to SLNB, while others with skin or chest wall involvement (eg, T4a-c) should be treated with ALND (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>). Those who undergo neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced disease should be re-evaluated for the suitability of SLNB prior to surgery. Additionally, SLNB should be omitted in patients whose axillary status does not guide adjuvant therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H841746368\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinically positive nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that patients who have clinically positive nodes that have been pathologically proven to contain metastatic cancer should undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for axillary clearance, rather than SLNB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H665291959\"><span class=\"h3\">Locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology and the 2010 International Expert Panel guidelines on SLNB recommend <strong>against</strong> the use of SLNB in patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/10,14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,17</a>]. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is recommended for this group of patients to maximize locoregional control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Since larger tumors have a higher likelihood of metastasizing to axillary nodes, most trials have restricted SLNB use to T1 or T2 breast cancers (&lt;5 cm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>). However, some studies have shown that SLNB can be accurate in patients with T3 tumors and clinically negative axilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Thus, many clinicians, including the authors of this topic, do not recognize tumor size of larger than 5 cm (T3) as an absolute contraindication to SLNB, as long as the axilla is clinically negative. </p><p>Patients with locally advanced tumors with skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest wall involvement (T4a-c) or inflammatory breast cancer (T4d) are <strong>not</strong> candidates for SLNB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The false negative rate is high in such patients, presumably because of partially obstructed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functionally abnormal subdermal lymphatics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2966213834\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients whose axillary status does not guide adjuvant treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not consider advanced age an absolute contraindication to SLNB in women with breast cancer, as age has never been shown to influence the accuracy, safety, and value of SLNB. However, SLNB should be omitted if the nodal information gained through the procedure will not affect adjuvant treatment decisions.</p><p>As an example, women over the age of 70 years with T1 cancers that are estrogen receptor-positive and clinically node-negative have excellent overall survival rates and distant disease-free survival rates when treated with lumpectomy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, with or without breast irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>We suggest that the decision to omit SLNB in older women be made in a multidisciplinary setting with input from the treating medical and radiation oncologists to ensure all providers are in agreement as to whether or not axillary staging information is important for adjuvant therapy decisions. This is particularly true for patients who are between 65 and 70 years old. Many surgeons would perform SLNB and completion ALND for healthy women at that age or sometimes older, depending upon their overall state of health, taking into consideration the patient's preference as well. The management of early breast cancer in older women is discussed in detail elsewhere.

It is controversial whether SLNB or ALND should be performed and whether it should be performed prior to or following the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in such patients. This issue is further discussed elsewhere.

Studies of breast lymphatic drainage indicate that all quadrants of the breast drain into the same lymph node(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Thus, subareolar and intradermal (rather than peritumoral) injection of radiolabeled colloid or blue dye make SLNB feasible for patients with multicentric disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/23,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25-27</a>].

In one study of 142 women with multicentric breast cancer, SLNB was successful in 91 percent of patients, with a false negative rate of 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, more patients undergo completion ALND after SLNB in multicentric compared with unicentric disease. The likelihood of finding additional disease at the time of completion ALND is also higher with multicentric disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5605226\"><span class=\"h3\">Previous breast and axillary procedures for benign conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two studies have demonstrated feasibility and accuracy of SLNB in patients who had prior excisional breast biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, it is unclear whether women who have undergone cosmetic breast surgeries, such as reduction mammoplasty or breast augmentation, can undergo SLNB. Patients who have had extensive breast or axillary surgery may have disruption or alteration to the normal pattern of lymphatic drainage, which may increase the false negative rate of SLNB. Thus, in these patients, we perform preoperative lymphoscintigraphy prior to SLNB.

Technical failure rates and false negative rates of an SLNB in this setting are related to the extent of previous axillary surgery and are in general higher compared with an initial SLNB.

In a meta-analysis of over 1000 patients undergoing SLNB for recurrent breast cancer, sentinel nodes were identified intraoperatively in 60 percent (95% CI 57 to 63 percent) of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Aberrant lymphatic drainage pattern was detected in 26 percent (95% CI 23 to 28 percent), less frequently after SLNB than after ALND (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.38).

Using a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosulfan-blue-dye-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosulfan blue dye</a> and radioactive colloid resulted in a significantly higher success rate and lower false negative rate in sentinel node mapping compared with using isosulfan blue dye alone.</p><p>The false negative rate of SLNB was originally reported as being 5 to 10 percent (sensitivity 90 to 95 percent), but lower rates were attained by experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/45,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,48</a>]. Despite initial concerns that this false negative rate would translate into increased axillary recurrence, subsequent trials found that recurrence rates with SLNB were comparable to those with ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/44,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49</a>].</p><p>In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-32 trial, for example, axillary recurrence after SLNB was 0.4 percent with ALND versus 0.7 percent without ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The low axillary recurrence rates in these trials, even without ALND, were presumably due to the effects of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) that may treat residual axillary disease burden. In patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy or ALND, the axillary recurrence rate was as high as 20 percent, as reported for the NSABP-04 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>SLNB is less morbid for patients than ALND.

The ACOSOG Z-0011 trial has been criticized for premature study termination due to low accrual and low event rates, protocol noncompliance, and high percentage (20 percent) of patients lost to follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/49,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,52</a>].

There were no isolated axillary recurrences, and the five-year cumulative rates of breast plus nodal and nodal plus distant recurrence rates were both 0.7 percent. Among a subset of 509 patients with known radiation therapy fields, only 21 percent of patients received both breast and nodal irradiation.

However, none of these studies was prospective. Thus, most experts recommend that all patients who are found to have extranodal extension in any number of sentinel nodes should be offered completion ALND because of the high axillary nodal disease burden associated with extranodal extension. </p><p>Other experts suggested that only extranodal extension that is &gt;2 mm should be considered an indication for ALND when applying Z0011 criteria to patients with fewer than three metastatic sentinel lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In one study, 331 patients with pT1-2, cN0 disease with &lt;3 positive SLNs underwent completion ALND. Thirty-three percent of patients with extranodal extension &gt;2 mm had &ge;4 additional positive nodes at completion ALND, compared with only 9 percent of patients with extranodal extension &le;2 mm.

Given that part of the axilla is included in the treatment field with whole-breast radiation, women who received radiation in the two trials probably experienced a therapeutic effect from radiation sterilizing any residual tumor cells in the axilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

Thus, we recommend omitting ALND in patients with one or two positive SLNs who plan to undergo whole-breast irradiation but not partial-breast irradiation until there are trials demonstrating its safety in this population. </p><p>Reported in 2014, the After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery (AMAROS) trial was a multi-institutional trial conducted by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The trial included 4806 patients with T1 or T2, primary, unifocal, invasive breast cancer without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Of the 1425 patients who were found to have positive sentinel node(s) by SLNB, 744 were randomly assigned to receive ALND and 681 to receive axillary radiotherapy. Ninety-five percent of patients in both groups had one or two positive SLNs. The five-year axillary recurrence rate was 0.43 percent (0 to 0.92) in the ALND group and 1.19 percent (0.31 to 2.08) in the axillary radiation group. There were no statistically significant differences in DFS and OS between treatment groups. Lymphedema was noted significantly more often after ALND than after axillary radiation at one year, three years, and five years. This trial was limited by a low number of events and a short follow-up period.</p><p>The AMAROS trial showed axillary radiation to be an acceptable alternative to ALND in patients who have positive sentinel node(s) but do not meet the Z0011 criteria. For those who meet the Z0011 criteria, however, axillary radiation is likely to add toxicity without conferring any additional benefit compared with whole-breast irradiation alone. Additional studies are needed before regional radiotherapy can be accepted as a standard approach for patients with axillary metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365981762\"><span class=\"h1\">NONAXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) techniques can identify nonaxillary metastases (eg, internal mammary nodes and intramammary nodes) in up to 43 percent of patients, depending upon the <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/type</span> of colloid injected, the injection technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>], and the primary tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">location/size</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

However, surgeons with less experience removing internal mammary nodes may elect to remove an internal mammary node if it is the only identifiable sentinel node. </p><p>When internal mammary nodes are biopsied, tumor involvement is found in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

In addition, some surgeons do not employ radioactive colloid injection and only rely on blue dye to identify the sentinel nodes.</p><p>Accordingly, additional noninvasive methods have been used to assess internal mammary nodes, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.

Although internal mammary lymph node biopsy can be accomplished at the time of mastectomy by splitting the fibers of the pectoralis major muscle, an internal mammary lymph node biopsy in a patient undergoing breast-conserving surgery usually requires a second incision, which is cosmetically visible through many types of clothing.
