Vascular testing may be indicated for patients with suspected arterial disease based upon symptoms (eg, intermittent claudication), physical examination findings (eg, signs of tissue ischemia), or in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis (eg, smoking, diabetes mellitus) or other arterial pathology (eg, trauma, peripheral embolism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>A variety of noninvasive examinations are available to assess the presence and severity of arterial disease. Physiologic tests include segmental limb pressures and the calculation of pressure index values (eg, ankle-brachial index, wrist-brachial index), exercise testing, segmental volume plethysmography, transcutaneous oxygen measurements, and photoplethysmography. </p><p>Ultrasound is the mainstay for preliminary investigative and noninvasive vascular imaging, with each mode (eg, B-mode, duplex) providing specific information that is useful depending on the vascular disorder. Other studies frequently used to image the vasculature include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. CT and MR are important adjunctive or alternative methods for vascular assessment; however, the cost and the time necessary for these studies may limit their use for routine testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Catheter-based arteriography remains the definitive, but invasive, vascular imaging modality and is often selected if concomitant intervention is being considered. The role of imaging in specific vascular disorders is discussed in individual disease-specific organ reviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58544620\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for noninvasive vascular testing to supplement the history and physical examination depends upon the clinical scenario and urgency of the patient's condition. An exhaustive battery of tests is not required in all patients to evaluate their vascular status. In general, only tests that confirm the presence of arterial disease or provide information that will alter the course of treatment should be performed.</p><p>Patients can be asymptomatic or have classic symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) such as claudication, or more atypical symptoms. Symptoms vary depending upon the vascular bed affected, the nature and severity of the disease, and the presence and effectiveness of collateral circulation. The clinical presentations of various vascular disorders are discussed in separate topic reviews.

Other goals, depending upon the clinical scenario, are to localize the level of obstructive lesions and assess the adequacy of tissue perfusion and wound healing potential. These objectives are met by obtaining one or more tests, including segmental limb pressures, calculation of index values (ankle-brachial index, wrist-brachial index, toe-brachial index), pulse volume recordings, exercise testing, digit plethysmography, and transcutaneous oxygen measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58544655\"><span class=\"h2\">Ankle-brachial index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calculation of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a relatively simple and inexpensive method to confirm the clinical suspicion of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. The resting systolic blood pressure at the ankle is compared with the systolic brachial pressure, and the ratio of the two pressures defines the ankle-brachial (or ankle-arm) index. This index provides a measure of the severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The patients must rest for 15 to 30 minutes prior to measuring the ankle pressure. To obtain the ABI, place a blood pressure cuff just above the ankle. While listening to either the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery signal with a continuous wave Doppler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76440 \">picture 1</a>) , insufflate the cuff to a pressure above which the audible Doppler signal disappears. Slowly release the pressure in the cuff just until the pedal signal returns and record this systolic pressure. Repeat the measurement in the same manner for the other pedal vessel in the ipsilateral extremity and repeat the process in the contralateral lower extremity. Measure the systolic brachial artery pressure bilaterally in a similar fashion with the blood pressure cuff placed around the upper arm and using the continuous wave Doppler. The ABI for each lower extremity is calculated by dividing the higher ankle pressure (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) in each lower extremity by the higher of the two brachial artery systolic pressures. The higher of the two ankle pressures (either measured at the dorsalis pedis artery or posterior tibial artery) is traditionally used as the numerator in the calculation of the ABI value. This approach provides a reasonable estimate of the potential for healing foot wounds and may be less insensitive for detecting PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. This is important to keep in mind when using ankle pressures as a means to screen asymptomatic patients for PAD; using the highest ankle pressure may fail to identify patients who would benefit from risk factor modification or medical intervention to reduce the overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An alternative method for screening uses the lower rather than the higher of the two ankle pressures (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) as the numerator in the calculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Screening for asymptomatic PAD is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calculation of the ABI at the bedside is usually performed with a continuous-wave Doppler probe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76440 \">picture 1</a>). The disadvantage of using continuous wave Doppler is a lack of sensitivity at extremely low pressures where it may be difficult to distinguish arterial from venous flow. A venous signal can be confused with an arterial signal (especially if pulsatile venous flow is present, as can occur with heart failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Under these conditions, duplex ultrasound can be used to distinguish between arteries and veins by identifying the direction of flow. (See <a href=\"#H58549051\" class=\"local\">'Continuous wave Doppler'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58548990\" class=\"local\">'Duplex imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>A low ABI is associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, progressive renal insufficiency, and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. The ABI is generally, but not absolutely, correlated with clinical measures of lower extremity function such as walking distance, speed of walking, balance, and overall physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>]. Further evaluation is dependent upon the ABI value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85752%7ESURG%2F50445\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85752 graphicRef50445 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal ABI is &gt;0.91 to as high as 1.3. Normally, the pressure is higher in the ankle than in the arm. A normal test generally excludes arterial occlusive disease. Mild disease and arterial entrapment syndromes can produce false negative tests. If ABIs are normal at rest but symptoms strongly suggest claudication, exercise testing should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

An ABI above 1.3 is suspicious for calcified vessels that may occur in the setting of underlying diabetes mellitus or end-stage renal disease and may also be associated with leg pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) estimated that 1.4 percent of adults age &gt;40 years in the United States have an ABI &gt;1.4; this group accounts for approximately 20 percent of all adults with PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>As with low ABI, abnormally high ABI (&gt;1.3) is also associated with higher cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/19,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study evaluated 4972 patients without clinical cardiovascular disease and found a greater left ventricular mass index in patients with high ABI (&gt;1.4) compared with normal ABI (90 versus 72 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Increases in left ventricular mass are predominantly attributable to an increase in afterload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-pathogenesis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Strong Heart Study followed 4393 Native American patients for a mean of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. High ABI (&gt;1.4) was present in 9.2 percent of patients, and low ABI (&le;0.9) was found in 4.9 percent of patients. Adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality rates were 1.8 and 2.0, respectively, for high ABI and 1.7 and 2.5, respectively, for low ABI relative to normal ABI (0.9&lt;ABI&le;1.4). </p><p/><p>In patients with arterial calcification, such as patients with diabetes or end-stage renal disease, more reliable information is often obtained using toe pressures and calculation of the toe-brachial index, pulse volume recordings, and transcutaneous oxygen measurements. (See <a href=\"#H58549539\" class=\"local\">'Toe-brachial index'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58544704\" class=\"local\">'Pulse volume recordings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58550072\" class=\"local\">'Transcutaneous oxygen measurements'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58549402\"><span class=\"h2\">Wrist-brachial index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wrist-brachial index (WBI) is used to identify the level and extent of upper extremity arterial occlusive disease. Upper extremity disease is far less common than lower extremity disease, and abnormalities in WBI have not been correlated with adverse cardiovascular risk as seen with ABI. Thus, WBIs are typically measured only when the patient has clinical signs or symptoms consistent with upper extremity arterial stenosis or occlusion. The WBI is obtained in a manner analogous to the ABI. (See <a href=\"#H58544655\" class=\"local\">'Ankle-brachial index'</a> above.)</p><p>Pressure measurements are obtained for the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist and brachial arteries in each extremity. The WBI for each upper extremity is calculated by dividing the highest wrist pressure (radial artery or ulnar artery) by the higher of the two brachial artery pressures. The normal value for the WBI is 1.0. </p><p>Incompressibility can also occur in the upper extremity. The radial or ulnar arteries may have a supranormal wrist-brachial index. This finding may indicate the presence of medial calcification in the patient with diabetes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58549539\"><span class=\"h2\">Toe-brachial index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The toe-brachial index (TBI) is a more reliable indicator of limb perfusion in patients with diabetes because the small vessels of the toes are frequently spared from medial calcification. </p><p>The TBI is obtained by placing a pneumatic cuff on one of the toes. The great toe is usually chosen, but in the face of amputation, the second or other toe is used. A photo-electrode is placed on the end of the toe to obtain a photoplethysmographic (PPG) arterial waveform using infrared light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71292\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71292 \">figure 1</a>). The infrared light is transmitted into the superficial layers of the skin, and the reflected portion is received by a photosensor within the photo-electrode. The signal is proportional to the quantity of red blood cells in the cutaneous circulation. </p><p>Analogous to the ankle and wrist pressure measurements, the toe cuff is inflated until the PPG waveform flattens, and then the cuff is slowly deflated. The systolic pressure is recorded at the point in which the baseline waveform is reestablished. The ratio of the recorded toe systolic pressure to the higher of the two brachial pressures gives the TBI. </p><p>A pressure gradient of 20 to 30 mmHg normally exists between the ankle and the toe, and thus, a normal toe-brachial index is 0.7 to 0.8. An absolute toe pressure &gt;30 mmHg is favorable for wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], although toe pressures &gt;45 to 55 mmHg may be required for healing in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Toe pressures are useful to define perfusion at the level of the foot, especially in patients with incompressible vessels, but they provide no indication of the site of occlusive disease. In addition to measuring toe systolic pressures, the toe Doppler arterial waveforms should also be evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H58544704\" class=\"local\">'Pulse volume recordings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58544690\"><span class=\"h2\">Segmental pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once arterial occlusive disease has been verified using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements (resting or post-exercise) (see <a href=\"#H146789783\" class=\"local\">'Exercise testing'</a> below), the level and extent of disease can be determined noninvasively and relatively inexpensively using segmental limb pressures. Specialized equipment in the vascular laboratory is used to obtain blood pressures at successive levels of the extremity, allowing for localization of the level of disease fairly accurately. Segmental pressures can be obtained for the upper or lower extremity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146789823\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower extremity segmental pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed in a supine position and rested for 15 minutes. Three or four standard-sized blood pressure cuffs are placed at several positions on the extremity. A three-cuff technique uses above-knee, below-knee, and ankle cuffs. A four-cuff technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80197\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80197 \">picture 2</a>) uses two narrower blood pressure cuffs rather than one large cuff on the thigh and permits the differentiation of aortoiliac and superficial femoral artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The pedal vessel (dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial) with the higher systolic pressure is used, and the pressure that occludes the pedal signal for each cuff level is measured by first inflating the cuff until the signal is no longer heard and then progressively deflating the cuff until the signal resumes. The pressure at each level is divided by the higher systolic arm pressure to obtain an index value for each level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58549 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>A 20 mmHg or greater reduction in pressure is indicative of a flow-limiting lesion if the pressure difference is present either between segments along the same leg or when compared with the same level in the opposite leg (ie, right <span class=\"nowrap\">thigh/left</span> thigh, right <span class=\"nowrap\">calf/left</span> calf) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58549 \">figure 2</a>). Well-developed collateral vessels may diminish the observed pressure gradient and obscure a hemodynamically significant lesion. Successive significant (&gt;20 mmHg) decrements in the same extremity indicate multilevel disease. </p><p>Pressure gradients may be increased in the hypertensive patient and decreased in patients with low cardiac output. When performing serial examinations over time, changes in index values &gt;0.15 from one study to the next are considered significant and suggest progression of disease.</p><p>With a four-cuff technique, the high-thigh pressure should be higher than the brachial pressure, though in the normal individual, these pressures would be nearly equal if measured by invasive means. The four-cuff technique introduces artifact because the high-thigh cuff is often not appropriately 120 percent the diameter of the thigh at the cuff site. A &gt;30 mmHg decrement between the highest systolic brachial pressure and high-thigh pressure is considered abnormal. </p><p>A normal high-thigh pressure excludes occlusive disease proximal to the femoral artery bifurcation. If the high-thigh systolic pressure is reduced compared with the brachial pressure, then the patient has a lesion at or proximal to the bifurcation of the common femoral artery. If the high-thigh pressure is normal but the low-thigh pressure is decreased, the lesion is in the superficial femoral artery. The four-cuff technique allows for delineation of level(s) of arterial obstructive disease and has been found to correctly identify the level of the occlusive lesion in 78 percent of extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>For patients with claudication, the localization of the lesion may have been suspected from their history.

Generally, three cuffs are used with above and below elbow cuffs and a wrist cuff (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68027 \">figure 3</a>). Index values are calculated at each level. In the patient with possible upper extremity occlusive disease, a difference of &ge;10 mmHg between the left and right brachial systolic pressures suggests innominate, subclavian, axillary, or proximal brachial arterial occlusion. Differences of more than 10 to 20 mmHg between successive arm levels suggest intervening occlusive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58544704\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse volume recordings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Current vascular testing machines can use air plethysmography to measure volume changes within the limb, in conjunction with segmental limb pressure measurement. The same pressure cuffs are used for each test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80197\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80197 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H58544690\" class=\"local\">'Segmental pressures'</a> above.)</p><p>Cuffs are placed and inflated, one at a time, to a constant standard pressure. Volume changes in the limb segment beneath the cuff are reflected as changes in pressure within the cuff, which is detected by a pressure transducer and converted to an electrical signal to produce an analog pressure pulse contour known as a pulse volume recording (PVR). </p><p>A normal PVR waveform is composed of a systolic upstroke with a sharp systolic peak followed by a downstroke that contains a prominent dicrotic notch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68273 \">picture 3</a>). Alterations in the pulse volume contour and amplitude indicate proximal arterial obstruction. The degree of these changes reflects disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Mild disease is characterized by loss of the dicrotic notch and an outward &quot;bowing&quot; of the downstroke of the waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68273 \">picture 3</a>). With severe disease, the amplitude of the waveform is blunted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68273 \">picture 3</a>). Pulse volume recordings are most useful in detecting disease in calcified vessels, which tend to yield falsely elevated pressure measurements. (See <a href=\"#H58544669\" class=\"local\">'High ABI'</a> above.)</p><p>Since the absolute amplitude of plethysmographic recordings is influenced by cardiac output and vasomotor tone, interpretation of these measurements should be limited to the comparison of one extremity to the other in the same patient and not between patients. The dicrotic notch may be absent in normal arteries in the presence of low resistance, such as after exercise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86998053\"><span class=\"h3\">Digit waveforms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with distal extremity small artery occlusive disease (eg, Buerger's disease, secondary [systemic] Raynaud's syndrome, end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus) often have normal ankle-brachial index and wrist-brachial index values. Arterial occlusion distal to the ankle or wrist can be detected using digit plethysmography, which is performed by placing small pneumatic cuffs on each of the digits of the hands or feet depending upon the disease being investigated. In a manner analogous to pulse volume recordings described above, volume changes in the digit segment beneath the cuff are detected and converted to produce an analog digit waveform. (See <a href=\"#H58544704\" class=\"local\">'Pulse volume recordings'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146789783\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing is a sensitive method for evaluating patients with symptoms suggestive of arterial obstruction when the resting extremity systolic pressures are normal. Segmental blood pressure testing, toe-brachial index measurements, and PVR waveforms can be obtained before and after exercise to unmask occlusive disease not apparent on resting studies. </p><p>Exercise testing is most commonly performed to confirm lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients with symptoms of claudication and normal resting ABIs. Exercise testing is generally not needed to diagnose upper extremity arterial disease, though, on occasion, it may play a role in the evaluation of subclavian steal syndrome. The discussion below focuses on lower extremity exercise testing. The principles of testing are the same for the upper extremity, except that a tabletop arm ergometer (hand crank) is used instead of a treadmill. </p><p>The dynamics of blood flow across a stenotic lesion depend upon the severity of the obstruction and whether the individual is at rest or exercising. Exercise normally increases systolic pressure and decreases peripheral vascular resistance. The effects of exercise on the cardiovascular system are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exercise augments the pressure gradient across a stenotic lesion. An arterial stenosis less than 70 percent may not be sufficient to alter blood flow or produce a systolic pressure gradient at rest; however, following exercise, a moderate stenosis may be unmasked and the augmented gradient reflected as a reduction from the resting ABI following exercise. Repeat ABIs demonstrate a recovery to the resting, baseline ABI value over time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68985486\"><span class=\"h3\">Protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many protocols for treadmill testing, including fixed routines, graded routines, and alternative protocols for patients with limited exercise ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a fixed routine, patients are exercised with the treadmill at a constant speed with no change in the incline of the treadmill over the course of the study. A common fixed protocol involves walking on the treadmill at 2 mph at a 12 percent incline for five minutes or until the patient is forced to stop due to pain (not due to shortness of breath or angina). The walking distance, time to the onset of pain, and nature of any symptoms are recorded. The ABI is recorded at rest, one minute after exercise, and every minute thereafter (up to five minutes) until it returns to the level of the resting ABI. The ABI in patients with severe disease may not return to baseline within the allotted time period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graded routines may increase the speed of the treadmill, but more typically the percent incline of the treadmill is increased during the study. A meta-analysis of eight studies compared continuous versus graded routines in 658 patients in whom testing was repeated several times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The estimated reliability in determining the intermittent claudication distance (initial distance to calf pain) and absolute claudication distance (patient can no longer walk) as assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient was found to be significantly better for the graded protocol for absolute but not intermittent claudication distance. The reliability of a continuous protocol using a 12 percent grade approached the reliability of the graded protocol. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with limited exercise ability, alternative forms of exercise can be used. Plantar flexion exercises or &quot;toe ups&quot; involve having the patient stand on a block and raise onto the balls of the feet to exercise the calf muscles. This form of exercise has been verified against treadmill testing as accurate for detecting claudication and PAD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who cannot exercise, reactive hyperemia testing or the administration of pharmacologic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papaverine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">papaverine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> are alternative testing methods to imitate the physiologic effect of exercise (vasodilation) and unmask a significant stenosis. Reactive hyperemia testing involves placing a pneumatic cuff at the thigh level and inflating it to a supra-systolic pressure for three to five minutes. This produces ischemia and compensatory vasodilation distal to the cuff; however, the test is painful, and thus, it is not commonly used. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68985493\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal response to exercise is a slight increase or no change in the ABI compared with baseline. If the patient develops symptoms with walking on the treadmill and does not have a corresponding decrease in ankle pressure, arterial obstruction as the cause of symptoms is essentially ruled out and the clinician should seek other causes for the leg symptoms.</p><p>A fall in ankle systolic pressure by more than 20 percent from its baseline value, or below an absolute pressure of 60 mmHg that requires &gt;3 minutes to recover, is considered abnormal. Severe claudication can be defined as an inability to complete the treadmill exercise due to leg symptoms and post-exercise ankle systolic pressures below 50 mmHg. Single-level disease is inferred with a recovery time that is &lt;6 minutes, while a &ge;6 minute recovery time is associated with multilevel disease, particularly a combination of supra-inguinal and infrainguinal occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58550072\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSCUTANEOUS OXYGEN MEASUREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TcPO<sub>2</sub>) may provide supplemental information regarding local tissue perfusion, and the values have been used to assess the healing potential of lower extremity ulcers or amputation sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-lower-extremity-amputation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for lower extremity amputation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Platinum oxygen electrodes are placed on the chest wall and legs or feet. The absolute value of the oxygen tension at the foot or leg, or a ratio of the foot value to chest wall value, can be used. A normal value at the foot is 60 mmHg, and a normal <span class=\"nowrap\">chest/foot</span> ratio is 0.9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Local edema, skin temperature, emotional state (sympathetic vasoconstriction), inflammation, and pharmacologic agents limit the accuracy of the test. </p><p>The level of TcPO<sub>2</sub> that indicates tissue healing remains controversial. It is generally accepted that in the absence of diabetes and tissue edema, wounds are likely to heal if oxygen tension is greater than 40 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A higher value is needed for healing a foot ulcer in the patient with diabetes. Patients with values of &lt;20 mmHg are severely ischemic and are likely to need revascularization for wound healing. A meta-analysis of four studies found a more than threefold risk of developing a chronic wound healing complication in patients with a TcPO<sub>2</sub> below a threshold of 20 to 30 mmHg (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58544718\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is the mainstay for noninvasive vascular imaging, with each mode (eg, B-mode, duplex) providing specific information. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate the location and extent of vascular disease, arterial hemodynamics, and lesion morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Real-time ultrasonography uses reflected sound waves (echoes) to produce images and assess blood velocity. Two ultrasound modes are routinely used in vascular imaging: the B (brightness) mode and the Doppler mode (B mode imaging + Doppler flow detection = duplex ultrasound). Duplex ultrasonography has gained a prominent role in the noninvasive assessment of the peripheral vasculature, overcoming the limitations (need for intravenous contrast) of other noninvasive methods and providing precise anatomic localization and accurate grading of lesion severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p>Both B-mode and Doppler mode take advantage of pulsed sound waves. Pulsed-wave technology uses a row of crystals, each of which alternately sends and receives pulse trains of sound waves with a slight time delay with respect to its adjacent crystals. The time and intensity differences of the transmitted and received sound waves are converted to an image that displays depth and intensity for each crystal in the row. A pulse Doppler also permits localization of Doppler shifts induced by moving objects (red blood cells).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58549051\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A continuous wave Doppler continually transmits and receives sound waves, and, therefore, it cannot be used for imaging or to identify Doppler shifts. It is used primarily for blood pressure measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76440 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H58544655\" class=\"local\">'Ankle-brachial index'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58549402\" class=\"local\">'Wrist-brachial index'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58544690\" class=\"local\">'Segmental pressures'</a> above.) </p><p>The continuous wave handheld ultrasound probe uses two separate ultrasound crystals, one for sending and one for receiving sound waves. Continuous wave ultrasound provides a signal that is a summation of all the vascular structures through which the sound has passed and is limited in the evaluation of a specific vascular structure when multiple vessels are present. However, the intensity and quality of the continuous wave Doppler signal can give an indication of the severity of vascular disease proximal to the probe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61122%7ESURG%2F72824%7ESURG%2F53869\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef61122 graphicRef72824 graphicRef53869 \">waveform 1A-C</a>). The quality of the arterial signal can be described as triphasic (like the heartbeat), biphasic (bum-bum), or monophasic. </p><p>Biphasic signals may be normal in patients older than 60 because of decreased peripheral vascular resistance; however, monophasic signals unquestionably indicate significant pathology. Monophasic signals must be distinguished from venous signals, which vary with respiration and increase in intensity when the surrounding musculature is compressed (ie, augmentation). It is often quite difficult to obtain ankle-brachial index values in patients with monophasic continuous wave Doppler signals.

The quality of a B-mode image depends upon the strength of the returning sound waves (echoes). Echo strength is attenuated and scattered as the sound wave moves through tissue. Angles of insonation of 90&deg; maximize the potential return of echoes. Higher-frequency sound waves provide better lateral resolution compared with lower-frequency waves. Thus, high-frequency transducers are used for imaging shallow structures at 90&deg; of insonation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58548990\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex scanning can be used to evaluate the vasculature preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively for stent or graft surveillance and is very useful in identifying proximal arterial disease. A meta-analysis of 14 studies found that sensitivity and specificity of this technique for &ge;50 percent stenosis or occlusion were 86 and 97 percent for aortoiliac disease and 80 and 98 percent for femoropopliteal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The identification of vascular structures from the B-mode display is enhanced in the color mode, which displays movement (blood flow) within the field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82357\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef82357 \">waveform 2</a>). The shift in sound frequency between the transmitted and received sound waves due to movement of red blood cells is analyzed to generate velocity information (Doppler mode). Flow toward the transducer is standardized to display as red, and flow away from the transducer is blue; the colors are semiquantitative and do not represent actual arterial or venous flow. </p><p>Accurate measurements of Doppler shift and, therefore, velocity measurements require proper positioning of the ultrasound probe relative to the direction of flow. An angle of insonation of 60&deg; is ideal; however, an angle between 30&deg; and 70&deg; is acceptable. The severity of stenosis is best assessed by positioning the Doppler probe directly over the lesion. The ratio of the velocity of blood at a suspected stenosis to the velocity obtained in a normal portion of the vessel is calculated. Velocity ratios &gt;4.0 indicate a &gt;75 percent stenosis in peripheral arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80574 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal arterial Doppler velocity waveform is triphasic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61122\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef61122 \">waveform 1A</a>) with a sharp upstroke, forward flow in systole with a sharp systolic peak, sharp downstroke, reversed flow component at the end of systole, and forward flow in late diastole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biphasic arterial Doppler velocity waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72824\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72824 \">waveform 1B</a>) has a rapid upstroke, sharp peak, and fairly rapid downstroke, with a short period of antegrade flow in diastole.

A monophasic arterial Doppler waveform is seen with multilevel obstructive arterial disease. </p><p/><p>Different velocity waveforms are obtained depending upon whether the probe is proximal or distal to a stenosis. Progressive obstruction proximal to the Doppler probe results in a decrease in systolic peak, elimination of the reversed flow component, and an increase in the flow seen in late diastole. Decreased peripheral vascular resistance is responsible for the loss of the reversed flow component, and this finding may be normal in older patients or reflect compensatory vasodilation in response to an obstructive vascular lesion. </p><p>The pitch of the duplex signal changes in proportion to the velocity of the blood, with high-pitched harsh sounds indicative of stenosis.

Visualization of the subclavian artery is limited by the clavicle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Any areas of stenosis are initially localized with color Doppler and then quantified and assessed by measuring Doppler velocities. In general, the ratio of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) within an area of stenosis is compared with the PSV in the vessel just proximal to it to estimate the degree of stenosis. For the lower extremity, the percent stenosis can be estimated. A PSV ratio that is 1.5 to 2.0 indicates a 50 percent arterial stenosis, and a ratio &gt;4.0 indicates &gt;75 percent stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80574 \">table 1</a>). The same general principles apply when determining the degree of stenosis within a lower extremity bypass graft. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no generally agreed upon criteria for determining stenosis in upper extremity arteries, and most vascular laboratories tend to extrapolate criteria from lower extremity arteries to upper extremity arteries. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Visceral arteries </strong>&ndash; Duplex examination of visceral arteries, especially the renal arteries, requires the use of low-frequency transducers to penetrate to the depth of these vessels.

In general, we suggest computed tomography (CT) angiography as the initial study for advanced vascular imaging, unless the patient has severe renal dysfunction or an intravenous contrast allergy (and cannot be adequately pretreated). If the patient has diabetes without acute renal insufficiency, a more accurate measurement of stenosis may be achieved by magnetic resonance (MR) angiography (which does not have the confounding issue of shadowing from calcification). MR angiography may also show vascular wall thickening better, as in patients with vasculitis.</p><p>Important factors in planning intervention are the distribution of disease, the length and severity of any arterial stenoses or occlusions by anatomic location, and the length of diseased segments, which are important predictors of the success of revascularization. In addition, for any intervention to be successful, diagnostic imaging must confirm that the vessels proximal to (inflow vessels) and distal to (outflow vessels) the artery to be treated are relatively disease-free. Diagnostic imaging modalities must therefore clearly and accurately demonstrate the inflow vasculature, the site of maximal disease, as well as outflow vessels or runoff at acceptable cost and risk to and acceptance by the patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT angiography<strong> &ndash; </strong>Helical CT angiography has been widely adopted for the evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms and is now commonly applied to the evaluation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has enabled fine collimation to be combined with rapid (arterial phase) contrast-enhanced imaging, which is necessary for evaluating the lower limb vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. Although CT angiography avoids some of the potential complications associated with traditional contrast arteriography, it still exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and potentially to large volumes of intravenous contrast agents (although newer techniques allow for lower contrast doses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MR angiography &ndash; MR angiography is a less invasive alternative to contrast arteriography and does not necessarily require intravenous contrast. Both phase-contrast (PC) and time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography are noncontrast techniques that detect blood by virtue of its movement compared with static surrounding tissues. On the other hand, contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography uses an intravenous contrast and relies on the T1 shortening effect of the contrast media within the arterial system. Although MR is time-efficient and cost-effective for the assessment of lower extremity peripheral artery disease, patients who suffer from severe claustrophobia or have pacemakers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> some other metallic implants are not candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease/abstract/1,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,55-57</a>].

DSA provides superior contrast resolution with lower doses of intravenous contrast compared with non-digital techniques. DSA also has the benefit of image magnification and imaging the vessels in real-time while also offering the option for simultaneous intervention.

Available studies include physiologic tests that correlate symptoms with site and severity of arterial occlusive disease, and imaging studies that further delineate vascular anatomy. (See <a href=\"#H58544613\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive vascular testing may be indicated to screen patients with risk factors for arterial disease, establish a diagnosis in patients with symptoms or signs consistent with arterial disease, identify a vascular injury, or evaluate the vasculature preoperatively, intraoperatively, or for surveillance following a vascular procedure (eg, stent, bypass). (See <a href=\"#H58544620\" class=\"local\">'Indications for testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic tests include segmental limb pressure measurements and the determination of pressure index values (eg, ankle-brachial index, wrist-brachial index, toe-brachial index), exercise testing, segmental volume plethysmography, and transcutaneous oxygen measurements. These tests generally correlate to clinical symptoms and are used to stratify the need for further evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H58549369\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The comparison of the resting systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic brachial pressure is referred to as the ankle-brachial index (ABI). The analogous index in the upper extremity is the wrist-brachial index (WBI). (See <a href=\"#H58544655\" class=\"local\">'Ankle-brachial index'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58549402\" class=\"local\">'Wrist-brachial index'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the lower extremity:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ABI of 0.91 to 1.30 is normal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ABI &le;0.90 is diagnostic of arterial obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ABI &gt;1.30 suggests the presence of calcified vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Further evaluation is dependent upon the ABI value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85752%7ESURG%2F50445\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85752 graphicRef50445 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a normal ABI who have typical symptoms of claudication, we suggest exercise testing. An ABI that decreases by 20 percent following exercise is diagnostic of arterial obstruction, whereas a normal ABI following exercise eliminates a diagnosis of arterial obstruction and suggests the need to seek other causes for the leg symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H146789783\" class=\"local\">'Exercise testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients with an ABI &le;0.9 who are possible candidates for intervention, we perform additional noninvasive vascular studies to further define the level and extent of disease. Depending upon the clinical scenario, additional testing may include additional physiologic tests, duplex ultrasonography, or other imaging such as angiography using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, or conventional arteriography. (See <a href=\"#H58544655\" class=\"local\">'Ankle-brachial index'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58549369\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58544718\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58544732\" class=\"local\">'Advanced imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an ABI &gt;1.3, the toe-brachial index (TBI) and pulse volume recordings (PVRs) should be performed. A normal toe-brachial index is 0.7 to 0.8. The normal PVR waveform is composed of a systolic upstroke with a sharp systolic peak followed by a downstroke that contains a prominent dicrotic notch. Progressive obstruction alters the normal waveform and blunts its amplitude. (See <a href=\"#H58544669\" class=\"local\">'High ABI'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58549539\" class=\"local\">'Toe-brachial index'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58544704\" class=\"local\">'Pulse volume recordings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess the potential for healing a wound or proposed surgical site, transcutaneous oxygen measurement (or skin perfusion studies) may supplement other physiologic tests by providing information regarding local tissue perfusion. A normal value at the foot is 60 mmHg, and a normal <span class=\"nowrap\">chest/foot</span> ratio is 0.9. (See <a href=\"#H58550072\" class=\"local\">'Transcutaneous oxygen measurements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a normal ankle- or wrist-brachial index and distal extremity ischemia, individual digit waveforms and digit pressures can be used to identify small-vessel occlusive arterial disease. (See <a href=\"#H86998053\" class=\"local\">'Digit waveforms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound is routinely used for vascular imaging. B-mode imaging is the primary modality for evaluating and following aneurysmal disease, while duplex scanning is used to define the site and severity of vascular obstruction. Areas of stenosis localized with Doppler can be quantified by comparing the peak systolic velocity (PSV) within a narrowed area to the PSV in the vessel just proximal to it (PSV ratio). The percent stenosis in lower extremity native vessels and vascular grafts can be estimated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80574 \">table 1</a>). A PSV ratio &gt;4.0 indicates a &gt;75 percent stenosis. These criteria can also be used for the upper extremity. Validated criteria for the visceral vessels are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76874 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H58544718\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional arteriography remains the gold standard for vascular imaging and, under some circumstances (eg, acute ischemia), is the primary imaging modality because it offers the benefit of potential simultaneous intervention. Other advanced imaging modalities include CT and MR angiography. (See <a href=\"#H58544732\" class=\"local\">'Advanced imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220026054\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
