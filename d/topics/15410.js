Over the past few decades, professional allergy societies in the United States have made attempts to reduce variations in practice across the United States and identify best practices. Practice parameters for SCIT have been published and the practices described in this topic review are consistent with American guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review conventional schedules for the administration of SCIT, focusing on those used to administer inhalant allergens. Adjustments in schedules in response to adverse effects, injection techniques, safety requirements for facilities at which immunotherapy is given, documentation, and patient monitoring will also be discussed. Accelerated schedules for SCIT (including rush, cluster, and ultrarush) and schedules for Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring&quot;, section on 'Choice of protocol'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754392\"><span class=\"h1\">CONVENTIONAL SCHEDULES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCIT schedules differ in the number of injections per visit, number of visits per week, and the rapidity with which the patient reaches the maintenance dose. Conventional immunotherapy schedules involve one to three injections per week during a build-up phase that lasts a number of weeks, followed by a maintenance phase, during which injections are given every two to four weeks over a period of years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054966936\"><span class=\"h2\">Build-up phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are faster and slower versions of conventional schedules. The clinician may choose a schedule with a slower (more gradual) build-up for the patient at increased risk for a systemic allergic reaction to the immunotherapy itself. The primary advantage of slower schedules is the reduced risk of systemic allergic reactions. An example of a conservative build-up schedule is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60803 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Within the spectrum of conventional schedules, more conservative schedules are appropriate for patients with any of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple large reactions during allergen skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms during skin testing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent asthma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of systemic allergic reactions to previous immunotherapy</p><p/><p>Patients without these characteristics usually tolerate a more moderate schedule, such as that shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72555 \">table 2</a>). The example provided here was published by Greer Labs and involves 14 fewer injections to reach maintenance than the slower schedule discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Advantages of faster schedules include patient and clinician convenience and a shorter time to maintenance and clinical improvement.</p><p>Clinicians may be reluctant to initiate pollen immunotherapy during times of the year when pollen counts are high. However, a systematic review found that rates of systemic reactions were not higher in patients beginning pollen immunotherapy during pollen seasons, compared with those starting therapy at other times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868046\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the maintenance phase, the interval between injections is usually increased from once weekly up to a maximum of once monthly for inhalant allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some clinicians give maintenance injections every two weeks, while others prefer every three to four weeks. Certain patients receiving maintenance injections at three- or four-week intervals may report that allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis symptoms become bothersome the week before their next maintenance injection is due. In this situation, the interval can be shortened to see if better symptom control is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868053\"><span class=\"h2\">Total duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended duration of SCIT is three to five years of maintenance therapy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Factors associated with fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868806\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety precautions at every visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Personnel responsible for administering immunotherapy injections should be trained to perform the following measures methodically at the beginning of each patient visit to increase safety.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relatively common cause of systemic reactions to immunotherapy is the administration of an extract to the wrong patient. For this reason, it is critical to ensure that the allergen immunotherapy extract and dilution are the correct one for the patient before administering the injection. It is advised that patients be asked to provide two identifying pieces of information (eg, name and birth date) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be questioned to determine if any local or systemic reactions developed following the previous injection(s).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has been instructed to take an antihistamine prior to the visit, staff should confirm that this was done. Premedication with a nonsedating H1-antihistamine is suggested for selected patients, including those experiencing recurrent large local reactions or systemic reactions to prior injections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Premedication'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be questioned to determine if there have been any changes in health status or in medications since the last injection. The onset of pregnancy or the introduction of beta-adrenergic blocker medication should be a cause for re-evaluating the continuation of immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider routinely performing a peak expiratory flow test in patients with asthma. Patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation should not be given an injection that day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In those who do receive injections, a repeat measurement of peak expiratory flow may be considered prior to discharge from the clinic, even in the absence of symptoms, because some patients are unaware of or ignore changes in lung function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should wait at the site where they received their immunotherapy injection for 30 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be instructed not to exercise vigorously for at least several hours after receiving an immunotherapy injection. Some clinicians advise patients to avoid vigorous exercise for an hour or two before injections as well. This advice is intended to minimize rapid uptake of the allergen into the systemic circulation, although its utility in preventing systemic reactions has not been formally studied.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868813\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunotherapy injections should be given using a calibrated small volume syringe (usually a 1 mL syringe) with a 26- to 27-gauge nonremovable needle (usually three-eighths to one-half inch [0.9 to 1.3 cm] in length) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has mandated that needles with safety-engineered sharp injury protection be used.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The site should be wiped with an alcohol swab before giving the injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections should be given subcutaneously in the lateral or posterior middle portion of the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The subcutaneous tissue has limited blood supply compared to other tissues and allows for slow absorption. Intramuscular injection is avoided because it would lead to more rapid absorption and increased risk of a systemic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plunger of the syringe may be pulled back slightly to check for blood return before injecting, as an extra safety step. However, a retrospective and prospective study failed to detect blood during 35,000 immunotherapy and immunization injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Occasionally, patients request that injections be administered somewhere other than the upper arm, usually because of large or persistent local reactions. In this situation, the thigh could be used, provided the patient has adequate subcutaneous tissue and the underlying muscle can be successfully avoided. The thigh is probably preferable to the buttocks, as it would not be possible to apply a tourniquet to slow systemic absorption in the event of a severe systemic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754801\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAINING AND PREPARATION FOR MANAGING SYSTEMIC REACTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754406\"><span class=\"h2\">Personnel and site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergen immunotherapy should be administered in a setting where prompt recognition and treatment of a systemic reaction are optimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The preferred location of administration of allergen immunotherapy is in the office of the allergy expert who prepared the patient's immunotherapy extract. There should be a clinician or clinician extender (advanced registered nurse practitioner or physician's assistant) appropriately trained in emergency treatment immediately available in the medical facility. These precautions are especially important for patients at high risk for systemic reactions (highly sensitive, severe symptoms, comorbid conditions, or history of recurrent systemic reactions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868663\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment and medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following equipment and medications should be immediately available<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stethoscope and sphygmomanometer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aqueous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> 1:1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">w/v</span> (ie, the primary treatment for anaphylaxis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tourniquet, syringes, large bore (14 gauge) needles and intravenous catheters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equipment to administer oxygen by mask</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous fluid set-up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamine for injection (second-line treatment)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids for IM or IV administration (second-line treatment)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equipment to maintain an airway, appropriate for the supervising clinician's expertise and skill</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glucagon</a> kit for patients on beta-blockers</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754824\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IMMUNOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse reactions to SCIT consist of local reactions at the site of injection and systemic allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868494\"><span class=\"h2\">Local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection site reactions consist of redness, pruritus, and swelling. A local reaction can range from a few mm in diameter to swelling and erythema that encompasses most of the patient's upper arm. They may progressively increase in size over several hours and persist for over 24 hours. Local reactions to SCIT are common, with 30 to 80 percent of immunotherapy patients experiencing these at least some of the time. Consensus is lacking about what degree of local reaction is expected with SCIT. Some studies have characterized a local reaction as large if it exceeds 2.5 cm in diameter, while others have defined large as bigger than the patient's palm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Several factors may contribute to local reactions. A single site retrospective study found correlations between higher allergen concentration, greater number of allergens per extract, and larger injection volume and higher rates of local reactions smaller than the patient's palm (although not with reactions larger than that) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> concentrations were not associated with local reactions, although glycerin is known to cause injection site pain, particularly as concentrations approach 50 percent and with higher injection volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868508\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local reactions can be reduced by premedication with an antihistamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Data are lacking on the utility of other interventions, such as the application of cold packs or topical corticosteroid preparations, or dividing the dose between two arms. These measures can be tried for patients with recurrent and bothersome large local reactions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Montelukast</a> was found in a small randomized pilot study of just 15 patients to be helpful in reducing the severity of local reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but another small study suggested that montelukast might reduce the effectiveness of SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], so more investigation is required regarding the impact of antileukotriene medications on SCIT.</p><p>One study found that a local reaction in response to an injection did not predict a repeat local reaction at the next visit, suggesting that dose reduction was not indicated for the prevention of recurrent local reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962660\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship between local and systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two large studies found that local reactions are not immediate harbingers of systemic reactions, and that systemic reactions are not prevented by adjusting the dose in response to large local reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, other studies found that systemic reactions were more common in patients who experienced frequent moderate-sized local reactions (&gt;2.5 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and were four times as frequent in patients who experienced a local reaction larger than the size of their palm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One interpretation of this finding is that the tendency to develop large local reactions with SCIT is a marker for a patient who is at higher risk (for undefined reasons) for systemic reactions at some point during therapy.</p><p>In summary, if a patient has developed a large local reaction (often defined as swelling and erythema bigger than the patient's palm), there is no evidence that decreasing the amount of extract used for the next injection helps prevent either a recurrent local reaction or a systemic reaction. However, many clinicians choose to be cautious and either repeat the same dose that caused the reaction, or reduce the dose slightly. For patients experiencing frequent medium to large local reactions (&ge;2.5 cm) or a single large local reaction greater than palm-sized, there is an increased risk for a systemic reaction some time during the course of therapy, and for patients in the build-up phase, clinicians may wish to change to a more gradually increasing schedule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868501\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic allergic reactions to SCIT involve organ systems distant from the injection site. Most serious systemic reactions occur within 30 minutes after the injection, therefore a 30-minute waiting period following injection is recommended. These reactions may range in severity from mild rhinitis to fatal cardiopulmonary arrest. A system for classifying the severity of these reactions has been developed and its use is endorsed by the practice parameters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F85944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85944 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p>The incidence of, risk factors for, and measures to prevent systemic reactions to SCIT are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p>Delayed and biphasic systemic reactions are also reported following SCIT injections. Because these typically occur after the patient leaves the treatment facility, patients should be warned about these reactions and be instructed what action to take should symptoms occur. Some clinicians provide all or selected patients with autoinjectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to use for these late occurring systemic reactions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed systemic reactions, occurring more than 30 minutes after the injection, constitute 27 to 50 percent of all systemic reactions. However, these are usually not severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biphasic systemic reactions, defined by resolution of the initial symptoms followed by recurrence of systemic symptoms 2 to 24 hours following the injection, have been reported in up to 23 percent of systemic immunotherapy reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The recurrent symptoms are generally less severe than the initial reaction. Biphasic anaphylaxis from all causes is reviewed elsewhere.

As an example, if a patient is receiving 0.5 mL of a maintenance [1:1 <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/volume</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(v/v)]</span> solution and the dose is reduced by half, this means that 0.25 mL of the 1:1 <span class=\"nowrap\">v/v</span> solution would be given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868733\"><span class=\"h2\">Following systemic allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common practice following a systemic reaction to reduce the next injection to the previously tolerated dose and, in cases of very severe reactions, to an even lower dose. However, there are wide variations in the degree to which clinicians reduce doses, and the issue has not been formally studied to identify the best approach. In the case of very severe reactions, the prescribing clinician should review the course of immunotherapy to determine whether the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> assessment justifies continuation of immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This is done because the fresh vials may be more potent due to gradual loss of potency in the old vials or variations in potency of different lots of extract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6473761\"><span class=\"h2\">New allergen added to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a new allergen extract is introduced, it can be given as a separate injection and built up to the maintenance dose, then added to the allergen immunotherapy extract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868769\"><span class=\"h2\">Change in supplier of allergen extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may occasionally be necessary to change suppliers of extracts. There are no published recommendations on how best to transition patients from one brand of extract to another, and the approach described here is that of the author and editors of UpToDate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardized extracts should be relatively similar among suppliers. We would suggest reducing the dose slightly when changing brands. As an example, if a patient was receiving standardized dust mite mix or cat, the initial dose from the new supplier could be reduced to approximately one-fifth the previous dose, with build-up from there (eg, from 0.5 mL of 1:1 to 0.1 mL of 1:1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonstandardized pollens have a greater range of variability, so one might reduce the dose by at least one dilution (eg, from 0.5 mL of 1:1 to 0.25 mL to 0.1 mL of 1:10).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cockroach and fungi extracts can be widely variable (even 100-fold or more), so one might reduce the initial dose by two dilutions or even further (eg, from 0.5 mL if 1:1 to 0.5 mL or even 0.25 mL of 1:100).</p><p/><p>Clinical judgment may dictate a more cautious approach in some situations, depending upon a patient's history of systemic reactions to immunotherapy, the season in which the change is being implemented, or other factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2963920\"><span class=\"h2\">High pollen and mold seasons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some allergists reduce doses during periods of high pollen counts in patients receiving immunotherapy for pollen allergy. However, two large studies including over 600,000 injections did not find a correlation between pollen counts and systemic reactions, although there was a correlation in one study with mean monthly mold counts from August to October [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Until the relationship between environmental exposure and risk of systemic reactions to SCIT is better defined, one option is to decrease the doses slightly in patients who are experiencing significant symptoms due to concomitant high pollen or mold levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868598\"><span class=\"h1\">DOCUMENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868605\"><span class=\"h2\">Consent form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should obtain informed consent before initiating allergen immunotherapy. Patients should be informed about the following issues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the treatment and alternatives to treatment &ndash; The alternatives to SCIT include medications, sublingual forms of immunotherapy (available for a limited number of allergens), as well as continued and strict avoidance of those allergens that can be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential risks, including a description of how frequently local reactions and systemic reactions occur and including the possibility of death &ndash; The risks of SCIT include the inconvenience and discomfort of local reactions at the sites of injections, which occur in 30 to 80 percent of patients to varying degrees, and the risk of systemic allergic reactions. Systemic allergic reactions occurred at a rate of 0.025 to 0.4 percent of injections, and in 7 percent of treated patients, in two studies of SCIT with aqueous unmodified allergens using conventional build-up regimens with multiple allergens. The rate of death from SCIT, as practiced in North America, has been estimated at one in every two million injections to 1 in every 2.5 million injections during the 1980s and 1990s. More data reported two fatal reactions in 28.9 million injection visits given in allergy practices from 2008 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Near fatal systemic reactions have been estimated at one in every one million injections. Anaphylaxis induced by SCIT is reviewed in more detail separately.

However, in both European and American studies, SCIT was found to be cost-effective compared to medication-based management, particularly in patients who otherwise require both nasal and pulmonary inhaled medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H88724563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anticipated duration of immunotherapy &ndash; Recommendations call for three to five years of maintenance injections. Once a patient has reached the end of this period, the patient and clinician should decide together whether to continue or stop treatment. Studies about the persistence of benefit after discontinuing SCIT are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H194201873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Persistence of benefit after discontinuation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anticipated success of immunotherapy &ndash; Allergen immunotherapy for inhalant allergens is expected to reduce a patient's allergic symptoms gradually over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. SCIT does not &quot;cure&quot; a patient of allergies, but rather reduces symptoms and often reduces the need for allergy medications. Different people experience different degrees of benefit, and it is difficult to predict with precision how much an individual patient will improve. Most patients see clear improvement in the first 6 to 12 months of treatment, which continues steadily thereafter as the treatment is continued.</p><p/><p>As part of the education of the patient they should be educated about signs and symptoms of systemic reactions and instructed to report symptoms immediately if in the <span class=\"nowrap\">office/medical</span> facility or to report any delayed systemic reactions to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868612\"><span class=\"h2\">SCIT administration form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The form provides a means to document each injection the patient receives.

A minimum of three to five years of maintenance therapy is believed optimal for maximal clinical benefit. (See <a href=\"#H22754392\" class=\"local\">'Conventional schedules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At each visit for immunotherapy, it is critical to ensure that the patient receives the correct extracts and doses, is questioned about reactions to past injections, and is screened for interim changes in health status that might increase the risk of a systemic allergic reaction to the injections that day. (See <a href=\"#H1868375\" class=\"local\">'Administration of injections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCIT should be given in a setting in which personnel are specifically trained in the recognition and management of systemic allergic reactions. In most instances, SCIT is best given in the office of the allergist who prescribed the therapy and with a clinician trained in anaphylaxis immediately available. Practice parameters specify the equipment and medications that should be present. (See <a href=\"#H22754801\" class=\"local\">'Training and preparation for managing systemic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local reactions to SCIT are common and related to several factors, including allergen concentration, greater number of allergens per extract, and larger injection volumes. The preservative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> can cause pain at the injection site, although it does not appear to cause swelling and erythema. Patients who have more large local reactions appear to be at higher risk for systemic reactions, although local reactions are not immediate harbingers of systemic allergic reactions, and dose adjustments based on local reactions do not prevent systemic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H1868494\" class=\"local\">'Local reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2962660\" class=\"local\">'Relationship between local and systemic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 30-minute waiting period following SCIT injections is recommended because most serious systemic reactions begin within this period of time. The incidence of, risk factors for, and measures to prevent systemic reactions to SCIT are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjustments to immunotherapy injection schedules may be required for a variety of reasons: missed visits, new vials, high pollen or mold seasons in patients sensitive to those allergens, addition of a new allergen, or change in an extract supplier. It is common practice to reduce the dose of allergen administered following a systemic reaction, although the utility of this intervention in reducing further systemic reactions and the extent to which the dose should be reduced have not been studied. (See <a href=\"#H22754840\" class=\"local\">'Dose adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important components of documentation include informed consent, which includes estimates of potential benefit, as well as a discussion of the risk of severe or fatal systemic reactions, and a longitudinal record of each visit for injections and any reactions that occurred immediately after or between visits. (See <a href=\"#H22754840\" class=\"local\">'Dose adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be followed every 6 to 12 months while receiving immunotherapy to assess compliance, clinical improvement, and adverse reactions.
