The blood glucose levels are not sufficiently elevated to explain the hyperkalemia, she is no longer on medications that cause hyperkalemia, and she is following a low potassium diet. It is time to initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>.</p><p>The diagnosis of Addison's disease should always be considered in the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia. However, in the present patient, the prior probability before further evaluation and treatment strongly favors the diagnosis of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (type 4 RTA) for the reasons noted above. In addition, she has type 2 diabetes with no evidence of any autoimmune disease. Also, the serum sodium level has been persistently normal and the blood pressure is elevated despite treatment with a thiazide diuretic, both of which reduce the probability of Addison's disease, a rare disorder. It is reasonable to initiate a trial of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>.</p><p>Return to the previous choice to try again.
