As a result, broad-spectrum therapy is warranted until the results of susceptibility testing are available. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> 2 g intravenously every eight hours because it has been shown to produce excellent ascitic fluid levels.

In this case, we request non-formulary use of cefotaxime and then request that it is added to the formulary for future use. </p><p>In addition to antibiotic therapy, patients with SBP who are taking a nonselective beta blocker should have the medication discontinued.

Once SBP developed, patients receiving a beta blocker had a 58 percent increase in mortality risk compared with patients who were not receiving a beta blocker (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10-2.27).

Delaying treatment until the ascitic fluid culture grows bacteria may result in death from overwhelming infection.

However, they also can develop SBP. Patients with a peripheral leukocytosis do not have a proportional increase in PMNs in ascitic fluid unless they also have SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; thus an elevated ascitic fluid PMN count must be presumed to represent SBP and empiric antibiotic therapy started. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Distinction from alcoholic hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p>It is also reasonable to give empiric therapy to patients with alcoholic hepatitis who have a PMN count &lt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3,</span> but who have fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral leukocytosis. Empiric antibiotic treatment can then be discontinued after 48 hours if ascitic fluid, blood, and urine cultures demonstrate no bacterial growth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of antibiotic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria such as <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella</em>; however, streptococcal and, infrequently, staphylococcal infections can also occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80188 \">table 3</a>). As a result, relatively broad-spectrum therapy is warranted in patients with suspected ascitic fluid infection. Clinical trials directly comparing different regimens are limited, and no antibiotic or combination of antibiotics has been proven to be superior to other regimens for the treatment of SBP. Our preference is to use intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> 2 g every eight hours for most patients because it produces excellent blood and ascitic fluid levels throughout the dosing interval. Alternatives include other third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. </p><p>The choice of antibiotics for treating SBP should take into account local resistance patterns and recent antibiotic use, and coverage should be rapidly narrowed when culture and sensitivity data are available. Open-ended use of broad spectrum antibiotics leads to selection of multiple resistant flora, and frequently, infection by those bacteria or even fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Antibiotic resistance is particularly a concern in patients who have received fluoroquinolones for SBP prophylaxis. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins also appears to be an increasing concern, at least in some regions, particularly among patients with nosocomial infections or frequent contact with the healthcare system.

A third-generation cephalosporin is a reasonable choice for suspected SBP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59554\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59554 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/1,5,11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,11,17</a>]. Our preference is to give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> 2 g intravenously every 8 hours. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> has been shown to prevent SBP in the setting of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], in our experience, cefotaxime is more effective than ceftriaxone for treating SBP. If ceftriaxone is used, patients should be given 2 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>One randomized trial that examined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> included 73 patients with cirrhosis and severe infection (either SBP or bacteremia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The patients were assigned to cefotaxime or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>. The following benefits were noted with cefotaxime:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of resolution of the infection (85 versus 56 percent), even though almost all of the organisms in both groups were sensitive to the antibiotics given</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No nephrotoxicity versus 5 percent with ampicillin-gentamicin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No superinfection versus 14 percent with ampicillin-gentamicin</p><p/><p>Dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> 2 g intravenously every eight hours produces excellent ascitic fluid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Lower doses or less frequent dosing can be used, especially in patients with impaired renal function. One study, for example, compared two different doses of cefotaxime in 143 patients with SBP: 2 g every 6 hours and 2 g every 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The rate of infection resolution was the same in both groups (77 and 79 percent, respectively).</p><p>However, adjusting the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> in patients with azotemia may not be necessary. We have used a dose of 2 g every eight hours in patients with a creatinine level &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (350 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> without toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Using cefotaxime in patients with azotemia may lead to high blood and ascitic fluid cefotaxime levels throughout the dosing interval, which in theory may result in improved bacterial killing. The main adverse drug reaction of cefotaxime is rash, which occurs in approximately 1 percent of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80469916\"><span class=\"h3\">Other antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other antibiotics can be used for the treatment of SBP. Whenever possible, the antibiotics used should have been studied for the treatment of SBP. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levofloxacin</a> can be used for patients with a penicillin allergy, although it does not penetrate into ascitic fluid to the same extent as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>. Fluoroquinolones should <strong>not</strong> be used in a patient who had been receiving a fluoroquinolone for SBP prophylaxis because the infecting organism may be resistant to fluoroquinolones. Organisms infecting patients who have been on fluoroquinolone prophylaxis are usually (94 percent) susceptible to cefotaxime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nephrotoxic antibiotics should be avoided because the underperfused kidneys in cirrhosis tend to be exquisitely sensitive to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of and risk factors for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Certain oral agents may be as effective as parenteral therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated SBP. One trial, for example, included 123 patients with SBP (who were not vomiting or in shock) who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a> 400 mg twice daily or parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The infection resolution rates were 84 and 85 percent, respectively. Another trial demonstrated comparable outcomes with a short course of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (200 mg every 12 hours for two days) followed by oral ciprofloxacin therapy (500 mg every 12 hours for five days) compared with intravenous therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In our experience, we have successfully used oral therapy in patients with asymptomatic SBP. Effective oral therapy in the outpatient setting also requires patient compliance. </p><p>In addition, confirmatory trials are needed before oral treatment of this life-threatening infection can be routinely recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80469945\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A concern related to the choice of antibiotics is the emergence of resistant infections, especially in centers that use fluoroquinolones for SBP prophylaxis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefotaxime</a> is appropriate treatment in patients who have been receiving SBP prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone.</p><p>Resistance to fluoroquinolones was illustrated in a report from a center in Spain where <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> prophylaxis is used routinely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Multiresistant bacteria comprised 18 percent of total bacterial infections. These changes in flora and susceptibility were attributed to use of norfloxacin prophylaxis and invasive procedures (eg, intravascular lines and urinary catheters). </p><p>Many liver units have avoided the use of urinary catheters for decades. This study provides some data to support the wisdom of this policy. (See <a href=\"#H80470406\" class=\"local\">'Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins also appears to be an increasing concern, at least in some regions. A report of 246 episodes of SBP in Spain found that 22 percent of cases were caused by strains that were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli and Enterococci) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The risk of resistance was related to patient characteristics and the clinical context. It was highest in nosocomially acquired cases (41 percent) and in patients with frequent contact with the healthcare system (22 percent), compared with only 7 percent among community-acquired cases. In settings where resistance to third-generation cephalosporins has been documented, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> can be used empirically as an alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, although there is much less clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80470068\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trials have found that short-courses of treatment for SBP are effective. Many patients will respond to a treatment course of five days. </p><p>One randomized trial compared 5- and 10-day courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> 2 g intravenously every eight hours in 90 patients with SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The two groups had similar rates of bacteriologic cure (93 versus 91 percent), recurrent infection (11.6 versus 12.8 percent), and infection-related mortality (0 versus 4.3 percent). Another randomized trial demonstrated that treating until 48 hours after signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared is also effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>We treat most patients for five days, including patients who are bacteremic (as they did in the 5- versus 10-day trial). Only patients who grow an unusual organism (eg, pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae), an organism resistant to standard antibiotic therapy, or an organism routinely associated with endocarditis (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or viridans group streptococci) are initially considered for longer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

It is unusual to demonstrate a survival advantage in treatment of a complication of advanced cirrhosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cost-effectiveness analysis looking at the use of prophylactic antibiotics was performed by evaluating studies that used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> 400 mg once daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> one double-strength tablet five days per week for prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Compared with no prophylaxis, norfloxacin prophylaxis resulted in savings between $2216 and $8545 per patient per year, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis resulted in savings between $2934 and $9251 per patient per year. The benefit of either regimen was minor in patients without a history of SBP. By comparison, higher savings were noted in patients with an ascitic fluid total protein concentration &le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or a previous episode of SBP. The analysis assumed that antibiotic prophylaxis remains effective in decreasing the frequency of SBP over an entire year; validation of this assumption requires extension of the follow-up period in clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4003828215\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antibiotic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients receiving a nonselective beta blocker, we permanently discontinue the medication once SBP has developed because nonselective beta blocker use in this setting has been associated with decreased transplant-free survival, increased rates of hepatorenal syndrome, and more days of hospitalization compared with patients not receiving nonselective beta blockers. (See <a href=\"#H6483398\" class=\"local\">'Discontinue nonselective beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected SBP, while awaiting culture results, we suggest treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>) rather than narrower coverage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Antibiotics used for the treatment of SBP should provide good coverage for the organisms commonly associated with SBP (eg, <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>) and should achieve good ascitic fluid levels. Cefotaxime (2 g intravenously every eight hours) provides appropriate microbial coverage and attains good ascitic fluid levels. A fluoroquinolone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>) is an alternative in patients who are allergic to penicillin. The selection of antibiotics for SBP should include consideration of local resistance patterns and recent antibiotic use (eg, a fluoroquinolone should not be used in a patient who has been receiving SBP prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone). Antibiotic therapy should be tailored once the results of sensitivity testing are available. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antibiotic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treating most patients with SBP for five days rather than a longer course of therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A longer course of therapy is appropriate for patients who grow an unusual organism (eg, pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae), an organism resistant to standard antibiotic therapy, or an organism routinely associated with endocarditis (eg, <em>S. aureus </em>or viridans group streptococci). In addition, a longer course of therapy is required for patients who fail to respond to therapy appropriately (See <a href=\"#H80470068\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After five days of treatment, we reassess the patient. Treatment is discontinued if there has been the usual dramatic improvement. However, if fever or pain persists, paracentesis is repeated, and the decision to continue or discontinue treatment is determined by the PMN response:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the PMN count is &lt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> treatment is stopped</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the PMN count is greater than the pretreatment value, a search for a surgical source of infection is undertaken</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the PMN count is elevated but less than the pretreatment value, antibiotics are continued for another 48 hours, and the paracentesis is repeated</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal failure develops in 30 to 40 percent of patients with SBP and is a major cause of death. The risk may be decreased with an infusion of intravenous albumin (1.5 g per kg body weight within six hours of diagnosis and 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight on day 3). Albumin infusion should be given if the creatinine is &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> the blood urea nitrogen is &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> or the total bilirubin is &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (68 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Once renal failure has developed, treatment with a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a> may be helpful. Daily infusion of 25 grams of 25 percent albumin should be also given, unless there is massive fluid overload. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Albumin administration for patients with renal dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SBP responds well to appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, patients who have liver disease severe enough to develop SBP have a poor long-term prognosis. In-hospital, non-infection-related mortality may be as high as 20 to 40 percent, and one- and two-year mortality rates are approximately 70 and 80 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at high risk for developing SBP, rather than waiting for SBP to develop to initiate antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In patients at high risk of developing SBP, antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with a decreased risk of bacterial infection and mortality. We also suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis be given continuously (daily) rather than intermittently (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Doing so may decrease the risk of bacterial antibiotic resistance. (See <a href=\"#H80470406\" class=\"local\">'Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H80470555\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H60337120\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients at high risk for SBP include.
