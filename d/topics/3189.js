The reactions can be broadly classified as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate reactions are reactions that develop within one hour of administration. These are usually type I, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions and are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonimmediate reactions are reactions that develop &gt;1 hour of administration, often after several hours or days. Common delayed reactions include maculopapular rashes and urticarial eruptions. Rare types of delayed reactions include serum sickness-like reactions, drug fever, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.</p><p/><p>Patients with past reactions to a specific cephalosporin may require subsequent treatment with a different cephalosporin or a related antibiotic, such as a penicillin, carbapenem, or monobactam. Approaches to these different clinical scenarios will be presented here. The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of different types of cephalosporin-hypersensitivity reactions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cephalosporin allergy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H999258\"><span class=\"h1\">PAST IMMEDIATE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with past immediate reactions to cephalosporins who require subsequent use of other cephalosporins or penicillins should be evaluated by an allergy specialist. The purpose of this evaluation, which usually involves skin testing, is to determine what other drugs may be safely administered to that patient. Most patients will be able to tolerate other cephalosporins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> penicillins.</p><p>Cross reactivity among cephalosporins and between cephalosporins and penicillins may arise from the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitization to structurally similar R1 side chain groups (most common) or R2 side chain groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitization to the core beta-lactam ring, contained in both penicillins and cephalosporins, or metabolites of this ring</p><p/><p>Sensitization to the R1 side chain group of cephalosporins is believed to be important in determining cross reactivity among cephalosporins, as well as among cephalosporins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> (which share side chains with certain cephalosporins) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65497 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Because of the different possible sensitization patterns, we suggest evaluating patients with immediate cephalosporin reactions with <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> and intradermal skin testing to all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic penicillin reagents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicilloyl-polylysine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicilloyl-polylysine</a> [PPL], the minor determinant mixture [MDM], and benzylpenicillin).

Rather, these similarities are best used to select structurally different cephalosporins from the one that caused the initial reaction to which the patient is less likely to react. The evaluation must still include skin testing, and, in case of negative results, graded challenge to determine if the selected cephalosporin can be safely administered. Graded challenges typically involve two or three steps. The starting dose is usually <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> of the full dose. Tenfold increasing doses are administered every 30 to 60 minutes until the full therapeutic dose is reached. Graded challenges are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions#H347080377\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;, section on 'Graded challenge (test dosing)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest selecting for evaluation a cephalosporin that has a different side chain, especially in the R1 position, from the cephalosporin that caused the past reaction. However, a similar side chain should not absolutely exclude a drug from consideration if it is the most appropriate drug for the clinical situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of skin tests (or in vitro tests, where available) for cephalosporin allergy may not translate into clinical cross reactivity. For ethical reasons, very few studies have confirmed the accuracy of positive testing results by challenging patients with a drug to which they tested positive. Therefore, skin tests need to be followed by graded challenge to determine if the selected cephalosporin is tolerated.</p><p/><p>With the above caveats in mind, there are studies demonstrating the utility of considering side chain groups when selecting an alternative cephalosporin. As examples, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> have similar or identical R1 side chains (containing a methoxyimino group) and cross reactivity among these drugs is regularly reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53755\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53755 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ceftazidime</a> has a R1 side chain that is slightly different from ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime, and cefuroxime. The ceftazidime R1 side chain has an alkoxyimino group that has greater steric hindrance than the methoxyimino moiety, and so would not be expected to be recognized by the same immunoglobulin E (IgE) molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Consistent with this, one study found a significant degree of cross reactivity between cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (odds ratio [OR] = 7.0, 95% CI 2-24), but not between these two cephalosporins and ceftazidime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in some studies by the author's group, there were subjects who had experienced immediate hypersensitivity reactions to ceftazidime, as well as to cefotaxime <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ceftriaxone in separate episodes and displayed positive results in allergy tests with the responsible compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

However, there are patients who react to both groups of drugs and there are at least three allergenic determinants that are shared by penicillins and cephalosporins that may be responsible for this cross reactivity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Side chain groups</strong> &ndash; Side chain groups may be the most common source of cross reactivity between cephalosporins and penicillins. In one study, patients with past reactions to cephalosporins with similar or identical side chains with penicillins demonstrated a threefold increased incidence of positive results in allergy tests with that penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin</a> has the same side chain as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefadroxil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefadroxil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefprozil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefprozil</a>, and cefatrizine. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ampicillin</a> has the same side chain as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefaclor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefaclor</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>, cephradine, cephaloglycin, and loracarbef (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65497 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small moieties</strong> &ndash; Small moieties shared by cephalosporins and penicillins can also be allergenically important. In one study, a population of IgE antibodies recognizing a methylene group present in both cephalothin and benzylpenicillin was identified in patient sera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Positive skin tests to both benzylpenicillin and cephalothin have been observed in such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta-lactam ring</strong> &ndash; A small percentage of patients with primary cephalosporin reactions may be sensitized to the beta-lactam core that is common to both cephalosporins and penicillins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Therefore, the patient is not at increased risk for reacting to a penicillin, provided that penicillin does not share a side chain with the cephalosporin that caused the initial reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65497 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive results on penicillin skin testing indicate that the patient may be reactive to the beta-lactam core, provided that the penicillin and cephalosporin in question do not share similar side chains.

In the largest study available, 98 patients with convincing histories of immediate cephalosporin reactions and positive skin tests to the culprit cephalosporin underwent allergy evaluation and graded challenge with several related medications. Overall, fewer than 5 percent had positive skin tests to carbapenems or monobactams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, clinical cross reactivity with cephalosporins appears to be rare.

Therefore, his IgE antibodies were probably directed against the beta-lactam ring, which is shared by all beta-lactams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergic-patients-subsequent-use-of-cephalosporins-and-related-antibiotics/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
