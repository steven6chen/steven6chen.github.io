Patient populations have been heterogeneous among the various studies; examples include studies of patients with early versus late stage disease, and community versus hospital versus autopsy based studies. In addition, there is substantial variability in the sensitivity of tests used to detect disease, ranging from analysis of pulmonary function to chest radiographs to high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Finally, the subclinical nature of the disease in many patients may further complicate definitive epidemiologic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these limitations, it appears that interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pleural disease are most common, although ILD, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), drug reactions, and infections have the greatest impact on patient outcome. </p><p>HLA associations have been correlated with the aggressiveness of joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additionally, the shared epitope HLA-DRB1*04 alleles may interact with smoking in the pathogenesis of RA and RA-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a separate study of patients with RA, carriage of HLA-DRB1*1502 was related to an increased risk for ILD (relative risk ratio [RRR] 4.02, p = 0.013), but not airways disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Interactions between external factors such as smoking and HLA susceptibility are thought to result in citrullination of proteins and development of auto-antibodies to the citrullinated proteins. RA-associated antibodies are found in the sputum of patients at risk of RA well before joint disease develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and shared epitopes between the lungs and joints have been described in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As an example, autopsy studies identified pleural disease in 38 to 73 percent of patients with RA, but only 5 to 21 percent of those affected had complained of pleurisy and just over 5 percent had radiologic evidence of a pleural effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,22</a>]. Pleural disease is most common in patients with longstanding RA, but can precede joint disease. In addition, it is more common in men and coexists with rheumatoid nodules and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in up to 30 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55932\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55932 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321153484\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of pleural disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RA-associated pleural abnormalities include exudative &ldquo;rheumatoid&rdquo; effusion, drug-induced pleuritis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>), empyema, bronchopleural fistula, hemopneumothorax, and pyopneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22,23</a>]. Pleural effusion and pneumothorax can be caused by necrosis and cavitation of a nodule into the pleural space with creation of a bronchopleural fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, chronic pleural inflammation can cause cholesterol (also called chyliform) effusions, lung entrapment, or trapped lung. In lung entrapment, the lung is unexpandable due to visceral pleural restriction from active pleural disease, such as rheumatoid pleuritis; while trapped lung develops as a consequence of long-term pleural inflammation that has left behind a collagenous or fibrous peel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74857%7EPULM%2F63153\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74857 graphicRef63153 \">image 2A-B</a>).

Patients with significant pleural effusions may report dyspnea. Physical examination may be normal or may reveal distant breath sounds, a pleural rub, or unilateral or bilateral dullness on percussion. Dyspnea out of proportion to the size of the effusion may be a clue to underlying lung or heart pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473809706\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with chest pain or shortness of breath, one of the first steps is chest radiography. The presence of pleural fluid, pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, or hemopneumothorax is usually identified by conventional radiography. Decubitus views may be needed to assess whether pleural fluid is free-flowing. Further evaluation of possible underlying ILD, adjacent rheumatoid nodules, pleural thickening, or unexpandable lung often requires high resolution computed tomography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63153\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63153 \">image 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a pneumothorax or hemopneumothorax, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan can identify subpleural cavitating rheumatoid nodules or blebs (eg, due to cigarette smoking) that are not visible on the conventional chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These are typically the cause of the pneumothorax and may require specific attention to prevent recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H321153128\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of pneumothorax due to rheumatoid lung nodules'</a> below.)</p><p>When loculated pleural fluid is suggested by the chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74857\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74857 \">image 2A</a>), the possibility of lung entrapment or trapped lung should be considered. In lung entrapment, the pleural surface may appear nodular and the pleural fluid loculated. With trapped lung, pleural thickening and loculation are also noted. Additionally, a paradoxical reduction in size of the hemithorax with the effusion compared to the contralateral side suggests a negative pleural pressure on the affected side, providing further evidence for the diagnosis of trapped lung. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnostic, ultrasound-guided thoracentesis should be performed in patients who have RA and a pleural effusion that creates a separation &gt;1 cm from the pleural fluid line to the chest wall on a decubitus chest radiograph. The purpose of pleural fluid analysis is to confirm that the pleural fluid is an exudate with cytologic characteristics of a rheumatoid effusion and to rule out alternative etiologies, such as infection, malignancy, cholesterol effusion, or unexpandable lung. Thus, the fluid is usually sent for cell counts, glucose, lactic dehydrogenase, protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, cytology, gram stain, and culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In rheumatoid effusions, pleural fluid analysis typically reveals a white cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;5000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> a pleural fluid glucose &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or a pleural fluid to serum glucose ratio less than 0.5, a pH less than 7.3, and high pleural fluid LDH level (ie, greater than 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77436 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,22</a>].

Cholesterol effusions have the milky or opaque appearance of an empyema, but are sterile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The milky appearance is due to an elevated cholesterol level (above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and sometimes over 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL);</span> cholesterol crystals, identifiable with polarized light, may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of cholesterol effusions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Empyema due to infection has similar pleural fluid chemistries to a rheumatoid effusion (ie, exudative, low pH, low glucose); the possibility of infection needs to be fully evaluated with bacterial and mycobacterial stains and culture, particularly in patients taking glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Cytologic examination of rheumatoid pleural fluid often reveals characteristic findings of slender or elongated multinucleated macrophages, round giant multinucleated macrophages, and necrotic background debris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the specificity of these findings has not been fully evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of ragocytes, also known as &quot;RA cells&quot; is neither sensitive nor specific.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193114814\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of pleural pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleural pressure measurement is used to identify pleural processes (eg, lung entrapment, trapped lung) that prevent the lung from re-expanding when pleural fluid is removed and rheumatoid arthritis is an established (albeit rare) cause of both lung entrapment and trapped lung. Formal assessment for lung entrapment and trapped lung usually follows identification of loculated pleural fluid on imaging or absence of lung re-expansion after thoracentesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89596\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89596 \">image 3</a>). Direct measurement of pleural pressure during incremental withdrawal of pleural fluid can be performed at the time of thoracentesis. The technique for measuring and analyzing pleural pressures is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H933974\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of pleural pressures'</a>.)</p><p>Lung entrapment and trapped lung have different characteristic patterns of pleural pressure and elastance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75040\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75040 \">figure 1</a>). The presence of a characteristic pleural pressure pattern can provide strong suggestive evidence in favor of lung entrapment or trapped lung. Definitive confirmation of lung entrapment would require direct visualization via thoracoscopy, but this is rarely necessary in patients with RA. Similarly, confirmation that visceral pleural thickening (a pleural rind) is the cause of trapped lung pleural physiology requires air contrast CT or direct visualization via video-assisted thoracoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473810743\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with a persistent, sterile exudative effusion, but without the classic cytologic finding of rheumatoid pleuritis, chemistries of cholesterol effusion, or pleural pressure characteristics of unexpandable lung, a pleural biopsy may be helpful in excluding other disorders, such as tuberculosis or malignancy, or securing a diagnosis of rheumatoid pleuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Pleural tissue can be obtained percutaneously or during video-assisted thoracoscopy. The thoracoscopic appearance of a rheumatoid effusion is typically described as &ldquo;gritty,&rdquo; with numerous small granules and nodules, ranging in size from 2 to 7 mm. Similar changes are noted on the visceral pleura, although the visceral nodules tend to be smaller [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

One area of controversy is whether a larger rheumatoid effusion should be treated to decrease the likelihood of long-term sequelae such as a trapped lung (fibrothorax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When rheumatoid pleuritis does not resolve spontaneously, several therapies have been reported to be useful including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), therapeutic thoracentesis, glucocorticoids (oral or intrapleural), pleurodesis, and decortication. The evidence for these treatments is mixed, but we would recommend starting with the least toxic. </p><p>When treatment is needed because of pleuritic chest pain or the size of the effusion, the initial choice is an NSAID, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The use of NSAIDs in RA, including dosing for a therapeutic anti-inflammatory effect and potential adverse effects, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3693478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p>Therapeutic thoracentesis is usually helpful if the patient needs acute relief of dyspnea, as long as the effusion is not associated with unexpandable lung due to lung entrapment or trapped lung. (See <a href=\"#H193114814\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of pleural pressures'</a> above.)</p><p>The optimal therapy for patients who do not respond to a course of oral NSAID therapy or a therapeutic thoracentesis is not clear. Local and systemic glucocorticoid therapy and treatment of rheumatoid joint disease with disease modifying agents (DMARDs) have all been tried with variable success. For symptomatic effusions refractory to NSAIDs, we use a moderate dose of oral glucocorticoids. According to case reports, oral glucocorticoid therapy (eg, 10 to 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> daily) may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Following improvement, in our opinion, the glucocorticoids should be tapered slowly to prevent relapse (1 to 2 mg per month once the dose has reached 10 mg). If the patient is intolerant of the side effects of systemic glucocorticoid, we occasionally administer intrapleural glucocorticoids (eg, 120 to 160 mg of depo-methylprednisolone acetate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27</a>]. Intrapleural glucocorticoid therapy carries an increased risk of pleural infection.</p><p>Use of chemical pleurodesis and decortication have also been reported, but are reserved for refractory effusions and trapped lung from a fibrous pleural peel, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-nonmalignant-pleural-effusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory nonmalignant pleural effusions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial management of cholesterol effusions due to rheumatoid pleurisy focuses on treatment of the underlying rheumatoid inflammation, usually with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and sometimes an additional immunosuppressive agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>). For patients with dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion, a therapeutic thoracentesis will often provide relief of respiratory symptoms while waiting for the effects of enhanced anti-inflammatory treatments.
