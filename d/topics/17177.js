These conditions lie along a continuum of disease and are categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system as therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. t-MN is a clinical syndrome that is distinguished by iatrogenic exposure to mutagenic agents. Excluded from this category is progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and evolution of primary MDS to AML (so-called &quot;secondary&quot; AML); in both of these latter cases, evolution to AML is part of the natural history of the primary disease and it may be impossible to distinguish natural progression from therapy-induced changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Patients with t-MN comprise a heterogeneous and poorly defined group who have a shorter median survival than patients with de novo AML, MDS, or <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span>. This subset of myeloid neoplasms shares many clinical and biological characteristics of leukemias and <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> that appear de novo (ie, with no known exposure to mutagenic agents). However, the t-MN cases most often have high-risk or adverse features, and as a group have had poor outcomes independent of other established AML prognostic factors. They are identified and classified as a defined subgroup largely to better understand how known mutagenic exposures impact human hematopoietic stem cells to give rise to malignancy. Undoubtedly, some patients who fall into this category based solely on their medical history have developed a myeloid malignancy independent from prior cytotoxic exposures, but these de novo cases cannot be distinguished currently.</p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of t-MN are discussed here. The treatment of de novo AML and MDS are discussed separately. Additional information regarding the pathophysiology behind the development of t-AML is also presented separately.

The incidence among patients treated with cytotoxic agents varies according to the underlying disease, specific agents, timing of exposure, and dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients can present at any age, but the median age at diagnosis is 61 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The risk associated with alkylating agents and radiation appears to increase with age, while the risk associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors appears to be constant across all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only a small percentage of patients treated with identical cytotoxic regimens develop t-MN; this may suggest that some individuals may have a heritable predisposition due to mutations in DNA damage sensing or repair genes (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</span> or TP53), or polymorphisms in genes that affect drug metabolism, transport, or DNA-repair mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The proportion of patients with a prior hematologic malignancy or a prior solid tumor is approximately equal and accounts for the large majority of cases. Five to 20 percent of patients will have a history of exposure to cytotoxic therapy for benign disorders while a similar proportion will have undergone an autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a series of 306 patients with t-MDS or t-AML, 77 had previously had Hodgkin lymphoma, 70 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 24 had multiple myeloma or another hematologic malignant disease, 117 had various solid tumors, and 18 had nonmalignant diseases, primarily autoimmune diseases or prior renal transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Symptoms most commonly relate to complications of pancytopenia (ie, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), including weakness and easy fatigue, infections of variable severity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemorrhagic findings such as gingival bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, or menorrhagia.

Two-thirds of these patients are first recognized by evidence of myelodysplasia (usually trilineage dysplasia), marrow failure, and pancytopenia. The chromosomal abnormalities seen in these t-MNs often involve complex abnormalities and monosomies such as -5 or -7 that have been associated with unfavorable risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>t-MN that develops after the use of topoisomerase II inhibitors has a considerably shorter latency period of one to three years and most often presents with overt leukemia and rarely with MDS or <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>]. The cytogenetic alterations typically apparent in these t-MNs often involve 11q23 abnormalities, such as t(9;11), or 21q22 abnormalities, such as t(8;21) or t(3;21).</p><p/><p>The latency periods with other agents are not as clear.

Details on the diagnosis of these specific disorders are presented separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Such cases may be identified by performing cytogenetic testing and immunophenotype evaluation at apparent relapse and comparing the karyotype and immunophenotype at relapse with that at the time of the initial diagnosis. The emergence of a distinctly different karyotype suggests, but does not prove, a therapy-related origin, rather than recurrence of the original leukemic clone.</p><p>As t-MN has become more common, there has been a push by some to refine and narrow the definition, either by limiting the interval from starting chemotherapy (latency period) to within 10 years or by restricting the diagnosis only to patients who have received alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors.&nbsp;This is at least partially due to a concern that patients diagnosed with t-MN may not be offered appropriate potentially curative therapy due to an assumed poor prognosis. We do not restrict the diagnosis in this fashion, but instead emphasize that patients with t-MN should be treated according to their cytogenetic and molecular profiles and their performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79891\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79891 \">algorithm 1</a>). &#160;</p><p>Of interest, the original reason for labeling these cases as &quot;therapy-related&quot; was to study the mutagenic effects of cancer chemotherapy on human beings, and not to set them apart for different or no therapy.&nbsp;We know now that it takes multiple genetic &quot;hits&quot; to create a leukemia, and the DNA damage may accumulate slowly over many years and from many agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Subclassification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, t-AML, t-MDS, and <span class=\"nowrap\">t-MDS/MPN</span> lie along a continuum of disease and are categorized by the current World Health Organization (WHO) system as t-MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Cytogenetic analysis revealed a higher percent of unfavorable cytogenetic profiles in patients with t-AML when compared with de novo AML (46 versus 20 percent). The high frequency of adverse cytogenetics may explain to a large extent the unfavorable risk of t-AML. Favorable and unfavorable cytogenetics had prognostic value in both patient groups. However, the survival of patients with t-AML was generally shorter than that of those with de novo AML within the same cytogenetic risk group. When updated to include 121 patients with t-AML, the median overall survival times for patients with t-AML with favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable cytogenetics were 27, 13, and 6 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report of 306 patients with t-MDS or t-AML found a median survival of approximately seven to nine months, which varied with karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

For patients who are not candidates for prospective trials or for those who do not wish to participate in trials, we offer the following approach that takes into account the patient's performance status and leukemia karyotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79891\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79891 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We reserve chemotherapy for patients who are fully ambulatory (ie, performance status 0 to 2) or have reversible leukemia-related illness. For patients with a poor performance status from chronic co-morbidities at diagnosis, we suggest supportive, symptom-directed care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of performance status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a good performance status and cytogenetics showing inv(16) or t(8;21), we suggest remission induction therapy (eg, conventional infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-daunorubicin-and-cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine</a>) followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation rather than allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Patients with treatment-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17) should be treated according to APL protocols that are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Favorable karyotype'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a good performance status and cytogenetics showing an intermediate-risk profile, we suggest treatment with remission induction therapy followed by an allogeneic HCT (if an HLA-matched donor is available) rather than consolidation chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients without a matched donor or those who are unwilling to assume the high rate of short-term mortality and long-term morbidity associated with HCT may instead choose consolidation chemotherapy after remission induction. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate karyotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Since conventional therapy results in poor outcomes, patients with unfavorable karyotypes are encouraged to enroll in a clinical trial of an investigational therapy.
