It is caused by a germ that infects animals. The germ lives in the urine of animals that carry it.</p><p>The main way humans get leptospirosis is from water or soil with animal urine in it. The germ gets into the body through cuts or scrapes. It can also get in through the pink, moist tissues called &quot;mucous membranes&quot; that line your mouth, nose, eyes, and other body parts.</p><p>Animals that can carry leptospirosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rodents, such as rats and mice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Farm animals, such as cows, pigs, horses, sheep, and goats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dogs</p><p/><p>Leptospirosis is more common in certain parts of the United States. These include Hawaii, the South, and the Pacific coast states. The disease is also common in South America, Central America, South Asia, and islands in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200943\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of leptospirosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leptospirosis can be mild or severe. Some people have no symptoms or very mild symptoms.</p><p>If symptoms do happen, they usually start suddenly. The main symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p/><p>Other symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whites of the eyes turning red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in joints or bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash</p><p/><p>Some people get very sick with leptospirosis. They can have serious problems in the lungs, liver, muscles, and other body parts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200958\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she can order tests to check for leptospirosis or a different condition that might be causing symptoms. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on samples of the fluid from your spinal cord (called &quot;cerebrospinal fluid&quot; or &quot;CSF&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200975\"><span class=\"h1\">How is leptospirosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who get leptospirosis get better on their own. But if you feel sick enough to see the doctor or nurse, he or she can prescribe an antibiotic medicine. You can take this medicine by mouth. This helps most people get well faster.</p><p>If you get very sick, you might need treatment in the hospital. Doctors can give antibiotics through an &quot;IV.&quot; This is a thin tube that goes into a vein. Doctors can also give treatments for serious symptoms such as breathing problems, if you have them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200990\"><span class=\"h1\">Can leptospirosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting leptospirosis by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying away from water or soil that might be infected, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Puddles, ponds, or lakes where the water does not move much or has scum on it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Water that could have animal waste in it &ndash; For example, waste that drains from a farm or ranch</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Soil on a farm or ranch</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping rats and mice out of your house or yard</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not touching rats or mice</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping food and drinks away from animals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting your animals a vaccine (shot) against leptospirosis, if possible</p><p/><p>There is no leptospirosis vaccine for humans in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27201005\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyolysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rhabdomyolysis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
