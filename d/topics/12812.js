Abdominal pain is typically related to the kidney cysts but may also be related to liver cysts. Pain may be acute or chronic.</p><p>Most patients can be effectively treated, but a minority develop chronic pain that is debilitating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A thorough history provides the best clues to the underlying cause of pain, and radiographic studies are an important adjunct to making the diagnosis. Pain is often not well managed, because there is the reflex response of many clinicians to give narcotics for complaints of pain without understanding the etiology.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the pathophysiology and common presentations of pain in ADPKD and a stepwise approach to its initial management, focusing on pain related to the kidneys.</p><p>The general management and the renal and extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD are discussed separately.

As a result, pain related to the kidney (as any visceral pain) may be poorly localized and can be associated with nausea due to the proximity of the sensory fibers to the vagus. The pain can also be referred to a distant cutaneous site (resulting in tenderness) since the activated sensory afferent nerves also have receptive fields on the skin in corresponding dermatomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, stimulation of the renal pelvis produces pain at the costovertebral angle and can also cause referred pain in the testicle or ovary.</p><p>Kidney pain may be precipitated by ischemia, inflammation, torsion or traction of the renal pedicle, and distension of the capsule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112426\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADPKD-associated pain may be acute or chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Chronic pain is generally due to the enlarged cystic kidneys causing stretching of the capsule or traction on the renal pedicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Mechanical pain may also occur due to enlarging cysts that result in lumbar lordosis. Acute pain may be caused by cyst infection, cyst hemorrhage, and movement of a kidney stone (nephrolithiasis). Acute causes must be excluded in all patients with ADPKD who present with abdominal or flank pain. (See <a href=\"#H8112694\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112433\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of acute pain are cyst infection, cyst <span class=\"nowrap\">rupture/hemorrhage,</span> and nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These conditions may be differentiated to some degree by patterns of pain and associated signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67374\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67374 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112440\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infected cysts cause the sudden onset of diffuse flank pain that is typically unilateral. Radiation of pain outside of the localized area is uncommon, and the discomfort is not relieved by position change. As with any kidney infection, fever, nausea, malaise, and leukocytosis may be present. If the infected cyst is walled off and does not communicate with the urinary tract, the urine sediment may be bland and the urine culture negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute pyelonephritis and infected cysts may be difficult to differentiate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnosis and management of cyst infection is discussed separately.

Patients often have point tenderness, in contrast to those with cyst infection, who describe diffuse pain. However, mild diffuse flank pain may occur when a superficial cyst ruptures and causes a subcapsular hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, patients describe ipsilateral shoulder pain, particularly when an upper pole cyst ruptures and irritates the diaphragm, or acute abdominal pain when a large hepatic or renal cyst rupture involves surrounding viscera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of ADPKD patients with ruptured cysts have gross hematuria due to the ruptured cyst communicating with the collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Episodes of hematuria usually resolve in two to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, excessive bleeding can lead to clot formation, with urinary tract obstruction and severe renal colic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Hematuria'</a>.)</p><p>Bleeding is typically managed conservatively with intravenous (IV) volume repletion, topical heat, and judicious narcotic administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Ureteral stenting is usually not necessary, unless obstruction due to clots persists beyond two weeks. Rarely, prolonged and severe bleeding may require percutaneous transarterial embolization or nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Embolization itself can cause severe pain related to parenchymal ischemia and can result in loss of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Therefore, this procedure should only be considered in cases of severe intractable bleeding. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> (dDAVP) has been used successfully in a few cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">protracted/intractable</span> bleeding in ADPKD patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of nephrolithiasis in ADPKD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Nephrolithiasis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112540\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pain is common among patients with ADPKD. Chronic kidney pain is more common in patients who have enlarged kidneys. Pain is often dull and persistent and is thought to reflect either stretching of the capsule or traction on the renal pedicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the location of pain can vary, and patients can have pain unrelated to the kidneys. In a review of 171 patients with ADPKD who filled out a questionnaire, the following order of frequency of pain was noted: low back pain, abdominal pain, headache, chest pain, and leg pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The severity of pain was usually moderate (4 to 5 out of 10). The HALT Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease (HALT-PKD) trial, involving 1043 ADPKD patients, reported the presence of back and abdominal pain in 50 percent, with 20 percent experiencing daily symptoms. Symptoms relating to abdominal fullness and pain were more frequent in patients with reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 20 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>), potentially due to both liver and kidney enlargement, especially in women.</p><p>Massive polycystic liver enlargement, although uncommon, may also cause pain. On the other hand, acute pain suggests a superimposed complication, such as hemorrhage into a cyst, torsion or infection of a cyst, or an obstructing stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain may begin with an acute episode and persist after the cause has been treated or develop gradually over several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A detailed history of pain location, duration, and associated symptoms will help to differentiate pain due to cyst formation from that due to mechanical (musculoskeletal back pain). As an example, patients with mechanical back pain may describe exacerbation of pain with movements that increase the load on involved muscle groups (such as bending forward or to the side, or ambulating). Chronic abdominal pain in an anterior location is generally related to kidney or hepatic cyst formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112554\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enlarging cysts cause chronic pain by compressing surrounding tissues, placing traction on the renal pedicle, or distending the renal capsule. Although the severity of pain generally correlates with the size of the kidneys, there is often little or no relationship between the severity of pain and the size or number of the kidney cysts: Patients with small cysts may have severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. There is no correlation between kidney function and pain due to cysts; severe pain may occur among patients who have completely normal kidney function, and, in general, pain tends to start early in the course of disease, before kidney function begins to decline.</p><p>Pain related to cyst formation tends to be a steady, nagging discomfort that is exacerbated by walking or prolonged standing. It can also be associated with early satiety if massive cysts compress the greater curvature of the stomach <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duodenum.</p><p>Patients can frequently pinpoint the pain with one finger, which is more often in an abdominal location rather than flank or lumbar. However, in our experience, the location of the pain described by the patient does not always correspond to the largest cyst(s) noted on imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112590\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatic cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic cysts may contribute to chronic abdominal or flank pain, although early satiety is much more commonly observed than pain among patients with hepatic cysts, in whom the enlarged cystic liver may occupy the entire abdominal cavity. In general, early satiety is more common among ADPKD patients who have both renal and hepatic cysts than among those with renal cysts alone. However, severe pain may occur; among affected patients, pain is generally most severe when the patient is erect, tends to be progressive, and may be resistant to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The management of hepatic cysts is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Hepatic cysts'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of cystic lesions of the liver&quot;, section on 'Polycystic liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1038616317\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical back pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with ADPKD, musculoskeletal back pain is probably caused by unbalanced or abnormal load on the spine and lumbodorsal muscles, created by enlarged abdominal viscera (the kidneys, in extreme cases of ADPKD, may weigh as much as 3 to 4 kg, in contrast to the normal weight of 0.3 kg in a 70 kg man) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation of paraspinal muscle group hypertrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in ADPKD patients with back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Mechanical back pain is insidious in onset and tends to worsen over time. Asymmetric cyst enlargement can lead to lateralization of pain and kyphosis, and the increased abdominal girth due to the enlarged kidneys (and possibly liver) can accentuate lumbar lordosis. These chronic alterations in posture can accelerate the development of degenerative changes in the spine and may predispose to spinal stenosis, which can further worsen back pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112694\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to determine the etiology of pain in an individual with ADPKD since some causes may result in severe systemic illness (such as cyst infection with septicemia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16218241\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal and/or flank pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of abdominal or back pain in patients with ADPKD differs from that of the general population only in the focus on excluding diagnoses that are more prevalent in this population, including renal cyst-related causes (hemorrhage, rupture or infection), pancreatic cysts, hernias, and diverticulitis. The evaluation of abdominal pain in the general population is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain in the emergency department&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A systematic history assists in focusing the physical exam and directs the subsequent evaluation; thus, it may prevent unnecessary investigational and imaging studies. The history should elicit the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location and radiation of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidity of onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency, intensity, and duration of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms and abnormalities (eg, hematuria, fever)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitating and relieving factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect of activity or position on pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relationship with food (eg, early satiety)</p><p/><p>The physical exam should be directed at excluding causes of acute illness, such as pyelonephritis, and can be focused on the region affected by the pain. The temperature and pulse should be obtained, and the presence of diffuse or localized abdominal or flank tenderness, or musculoskeletal pain, should be determined. The comprehensive evaluation of patients with abdominal pain, back pain, and headache are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-headache-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of headache in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A urinalysis and urine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed; these tests may distinguish between acute pyelonephritis versus cyst infection and rupture and nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with leukocyturia and a positive urine culture in the setting of acute flank pain are presumed to have pyelonephritis or cyst infection and should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Standard radiologic imaging is generally not useful in this setting, given its lack of specificity for cyst infection among patients with ADPKD. Although positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be more accurate in identifying cyst infections among such patients, PET scans are generally not performed unless patients are severely ill and other imaging modalities are ineffective or cannot be performed. The imaging and management of presumed cyst infections is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients who do not have leukocyturia, imaging tests (ultrasound or noncontrast computed tomography [CT]) are usually performed. A noncontrast CT is more sensitive for the detection of nephrolithiasis and is generally the preferred test for patients with ADPKD and acute onset flank or abdominal pain. A noncontrast CT will not differentiate between cyst infection and hemorrhage, however.</p><p>Once acute causes of pain are excluded, the patient may be presumed to have chronic pain associated with cyst enlargement.

Recurrent pain may also be related to continuous cyst growth. Generally, the pattern of pain is similar to the initial presentation, and repeat imaging is not necessary. The onset of a different pattern of pain or new associated symptoms may warrant further investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8112795\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic narcotic administration is rarely needed and should be used as a last resort. The great majority of patients require no specific therapy for pain other than nonopioid analgesics (possibly including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] for a limited duration). However, some patients have persistent pain that is severe enough to diminish the quality of life or to require opiates for pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-syndromes-in-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Once acute pain is controlled, we obtain imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography [CT] scan, or magnetic resonance [MR]) to determine whether a large cyst is present in the area of pain. Ultrasound- or CT-guided aspiration and sclerosis or surgical drainage may be considered. However, aspiration of a cyst(s) is usually not advised, because of reaccumulation of fluid in the affected cyst(s) after aspiration. Injecting a small amount of saline into the suspected culprit cyst can be a helpful diagnostic tool if the patient's pain pattern is reproduced by this maneuver.
