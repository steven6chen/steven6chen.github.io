In most cases, it is due to mutations in the gene <em>CLCN5 </em>that inactivate a voltage-gated chloride transporter named CLC-5. In others, it is associated with mutations in the <em>OCRL1</em> gene, which is also mutated in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Further genetic heterogeneity is assumed to exist since there are patients with the distinctive phenotype of Dent disease without mutations in either of these genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The disease is distinguished clinically from the Lowe syndrome by the absence of cataracts, mental developmental delay, and renal tubular acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 60 percent of cases, Dent disease is due to mutations that inactivate a voltage-gated chloride transporter, CLC-5, which is expressed in the kidney and is encoded by a gene at Xp11.22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another 15 percent of cases, it is associated with mutations in the <em>OCRL1</em> gene, which is also mutated in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Further genetic heterogeneity is assumed to exist since there are patients with the distinctive phenotype of Dent disease who do not have mutations in either of these genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10890273\"><span class=\"h2\">CLCN5 gene (Dent disease 1)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The defective gene identified in the majority of patients with Dent disease, <em>CLCN5</em>, which encodes the CLC-5 protein, is a member of the CLC family of chloride transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Although some members of the CLC family act as chloride channels, the members of the branch of this family that includes CLC-5 function as chloride-proton antiporters. CLC-5 is found primarily in the kidneys. Although expression of <em>CLCN5</em> has been detected in other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], there are no known extrarenal manifestations. In the kidney, CLC-5 is expressed in subapical endosomes in the proximal tubule, medullary thick ascending limb, and type A intercalated cells of the collecting duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. CLC-5 expression has also been localized to podocytes, where abnormal CLC-5 function might play a role in the development of focal global sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A large number of different mutations in this channel have been identified in families affected by Dent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1,16-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-27</a>], and these mutations inactivate the function of the protein in various ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/9,18,19,22,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,19,22,28</a>]. There is no correlation between the nature of the mutation and the presence of particular clinical features or the overall severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The CLC-5 transporter is a homodimer, and many missense mutations result in amino acid changes at or near the interface of the two subunits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Missense mutations fall into three categories or classes: one group of mutations leads to retention and subsequent degradation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum; the second group of mutations impairs the transport function; and the third group of mutations impairs trafficking of the proteins and their distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Approximately 250 affected families with Dent disease 1 have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the wide variability of clinical presentation in Dent disease and, in some cases, the absence of family history make diagnosis difficult, and therefore, the disorder is likely underdiagnosed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10890288\"><span class=\"h2\">OCRL1 gene (Dent disease 2)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most patients with Dent disease have a mutation in the <em>CLCN5</em> gene, mutations in the <em>OCRL1</em> gene have also been described in approximately 15 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/3,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33</a>]. This gene is also located on the X chromosome and encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase. Patients with Dent disease who have mutations in the <em>OCRL1</em> gene have been designated as having Dent disease 2 (Dent-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Approximately 25 affected males with Dent disease 2 have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In contrast to patients with the Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, which is also caused by mutations in <em>OCRL1</em>, those with Dent disease 2 do not develop renal tubular acidosis, congenital cataracts, or mental retardation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">OCRL1 gene and the Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The renal phenotype in Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome is similar to Dent disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a feature of both, but progression of CKD is faster in Lowe syndrome than in Dent-2 disease. As in Dent-1 disease, deterioration of renal function does not correlate with the presence of nephrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>All reported patients with Lowe syndrome have mutations in <em>OCRL1</em>, while those with Dent disease have defects in <em>CLCN5</em>, <em>OCRL1,</em> or neither.<em> </em>In addition, <em>OCRL1</em> mutations that have been found in patients with the Lowe syndrome are different from those reported in patients with Dent-2 disease. Although missense mutations in the phosphatase domain of the <em>OCRL1</em> sequence are common in both disorders, the nonsense and frameshift mutations in patients with the Lowe syndrome occur only in exons 8 to 23, while all such mutations in Dent-2 patients occur in the first seven exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/25,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36</a>].</p><p>This implies that the phenotypic differences between patients with Lowe syndrome and those with Dent-2 might result from tissue-specific expression of alternative <em>OCRL1</em> transcripts. On the other hand, variability of symptom severity or organ involvement could reflect variations in the expression of modifying phosphatase genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chloride-proton exchanger CLC-5 is present in the membrane of subapical endosomes in the proximal tubule. Along with a proton-ATPase that is also present in the membrane, CLC-5 facilitates acidification of these endosomes. As illustrated in the figure, high endosomal chloride concentrations in the nascent endosome drive proton entry and acidification. In the mature endosome expressing the proton-ATPase, CLC-5 provides a route for proton exit from the endosome, thereby dissipating the positive charge generated by the proton pump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107505 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193923264\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inactivation of CLC-5 and the consequent failure to maximally acidify subapical endosomes explain the low-molecular-weight proteinuria in patients with Dent disease. Low-molecular-weight proteins are filtered freely at the glomerulus, adsorbed to receptors (including megalin) on the apical surface of the proximal tubular cells, and then endocytosed. Impaired endosomal acidification results in a failure to process adsorbed proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107505 \">figure 1</a>). This may also lead to decreased recycling of the endosomal membrane back to the apical surface. Studies in knockout mice have confirmed the importance of CLC-5 in receptor-mediated endocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>The CLC-5 protein also interacts directly with components of the actin pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and with kinesin family member 3B (KIF3B), a protein involved in the translocation of intracellular organelles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thus, CLC-5 can substantially affect membrane trafficking in the proximal tubule. This is consistent with the observations that urinary megalin is reduced in patients with Dent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and in <em>CLCN5</em>-knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p>The discovery that mutations in <em>OCRL1</em> can cause the Dent disease phenotype points to overlap in the physiological functions of the OCRL phosphatase and the CLC-5 protein. The OCRL phosphatase affects endosomal trafficking both through altered cellular levels of PIP2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and through a direct interaction with clathrin, a protein involved in endosomal assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193923279\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of hypercalciuria and hyperphosphaturia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercalciuria in patients with Dent disease appears to be due to hyperabsorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract instead of a calcium leak in the kidney. This is supported by the observation that mice develop hypercalciuria that can be eliminated with a low-calcium diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In addition, affected patients and mice with partial inhibition of CLC-5 both have an exaggerated calciuretic response to oral calcium loading. In addition, the hypercalciuria often corrects with dietary calcium restriction (which, however, is not recommended as therapy; see below). This pattern is consistent with a role for calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) excess in the hypercalciuria. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>A small degree of hypercalciuria persists when dietary calcium is severely restricted in <em>CLCN5</em>-knockout mice that have biochemical evidence of increased bone turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In this respect, these growing mice resemble children with Dent disease who have a component of fasting hypercalciuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, in children and adults with Dent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], as in the knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], the largest component of hypercalciuria is diet dependent.</p><p>Studies of knockout mice demonstrate that recycling of phosphate transporters in the proximal tubule, although slowed, is intact. Thus, the hyperphosphaturia and increased 1 alpha-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in knockout mice and patients with Dent disease cannot be explained by impaired trafficking of phosphate transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Instead, hyperphosphaturia and increased 1 alpha-hydroxylation may be due to increased activation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptors on the apical membrane of the late proximal tubule by PTH. PTH is a low-molecular-weight protein that is filtered at the glomerulus, and, therefore, diminished low-molecular-weight protein reabsorption due to nonfunctional CLC-5 may lead to high levels of the hormone in the late proximal tubule, promoting receptor activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Urinary PTH excretion is high in both knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and humans with Dent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Phosphaturia and increased activation of vitamin D may combine to promote the disorder in calcium and phosphate metabolism seen in Dent disease.</p><p>The activity of the intestinal calcium channel TRPV6 is suppressed by OCRL, and disease-associated mutations in <em>OCRL</em> alleviate this suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Thus, intestinal calcium absorption may also be enhanced through mechanisms intrinsic to the gut, at least in the case of Dent disease 2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2596655662\"><span class=\"h2\">Common clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients usually present in childhood with polyuria, microscopic hematuria, asymptomatic proteinuria, or kidney stones. The prevalence of these clinical features among affected males with documented mutations are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74862 \">table 1</a>). Symptomatic disease is almost exclusively confined to males, with inheritance being X-linked recessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Dent disease has been reported in multiple ethnic groups and geographic regions including Europe, North America, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52-54</a>]. There are no known high-risk populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal tubular reabsorptive failure and proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant low-molecular-weight proteinuria is present in affected males and, to a lesser degree, in many carrier females. Protein excretion of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> approximately one-quarter of which consists of albumin, is present from early childhood and increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54</a>]. One-half of patients, whether Dent disease 1 or Dent disease 2, have proteinuria in the nephrotic range, but serum albumin levels are normal, and these patients typically do not develop nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Other signs of proximal tubular dysfunction, such as glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and phosphaturia, are also common in affected males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, these findings vary among patients and can occur intermittently in a given patient. As an example, hypophosphatemia occurs in approximately one-third of patients and is usually mild. However, renal tubular acidosis is not typically seen in Dent disease, although it does occur in Lowe syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H131450907\" class=\"local\">'Lowe syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and kidney stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most affected males are hypercalciuric until renal function starts to decline. The degree of hypercalciuria can be impressive in young children, who may excrete 8 to 10 mg per kg of body weight (normal is &lt;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. However, in teenagers and adults, the hypercalciuria is usually moderate, comparable to that in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria.</p><p>Nephrocalcinosis occurs in up to 75 percent of patients and is often evident in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56</a>]. Kidney stones occur in one-half of patients. These stones consist of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, or both. The main risk factor for stones is hypercalciuria; urinary excretion of oxalate and citrate is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrocalcinosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrocalcinosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum calcitriol tends to be normal or slightly elevated, serum calcium tends to be normal, and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) tends to be normal or low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1,54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54,57</a>]. In one study, elevated levels of calcitriol fell to normal when patients were given oral phosphate replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, it is unclear whether hypophosphatemia is the cause of high serum calcitriol concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately two-thirds of affected males develop some degree of chronic kidney disease, with decreased creatinine clearance becoming evident in some patients by late childhood. A similar fraction of patients with <em>CLCN5</em> mutations progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually between the ages of 30 and 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/8,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,56</a>]. Although most such patients have nephrocalcinosis, the development or progression of renal failure does not consistently correlate with the presence or severity of nephrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/1,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54</a>].</p><p>The cause of renal failure is not known. It may be related to the development of glomerular sclerosis (see <a href=\"#H461472273\" class=\"local\">'Renal pathology'</a> below); to the presence of bioactive low-molecular-weight hormones, growth factors, and cytokines in the tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]; to the consequences of lysosomal protein overload; or to abnormal renal handling of proteins that may inhibit calcification, such as osteopontin.

Focal global glomerulosclerosis is commonly seen without any basement membrane abnormalities, regardless of the degree of proteinuria; however, focal segmental sclerosis is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/54,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,59-61</a>]. The percent of globally sclerotic glomeruli increases with age and is several-fold higher than that expected at any given age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Tubular atrophy, varying degrees of interstitial inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis are also observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/54,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,62</a>]. Thus, Dent disease needs to be considered in patients with focal global glomerulosclerosis or asymptomatic proteinuria since immunosuppressive therapies would not be effective and are potentially harmful in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Studies have detected the CLC-5 protein in the glomeruli of normal individuals and in those with proteinuric renal diseases, but not in patients with Dent disease 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, it is unclear whether or not abnormal CLC-5 protein function plays a role in the development of global glomerulosclerosis in Dent disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3500057728\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemia occurs commonly among patients with Dent disease. In one study, plasma potassium concentrations decreased with age, and approximately one-half of patients over the age of 18 years were hypokalemic in spite of having impaired renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Dent disease&quot; is accepted as the encompassing name of this disease, based upon this <strong>limited</strong> renal phenotype that includes a partial Fanconi syndrome. The disease is distinguished clinically from the Lowe syndrome by the absence of cataracts, mental developmental delay, and renal tubular acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 60 percent of cases, Dent disease is due to mutations that inactivate a voltage-gated chloride transporter, CLC-5, which is expressed in the kidney and is encoded by a gene at Xp11.22. In another 15 percent of cases, it is associated with mutations in the <em>OCRL1</em> gene, which is also mutated in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Further genetic heterogeneity is assumed to exist since there are patients with the distinctive phenotype of Dent disease who do not have mutations in either of these genes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Molecular genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLC-5 is present in the membrane of subapical endosomes in the proximal tubule. Along with a proton-ATPase that is also present in the membrane, CLC-5 in part facilitates acidification of these endosomes by allowing for chloride entry and proton exit from the endosome, thereby dissipating the positive charge generated by the proton pump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107505 \">figure 1</a>). The inactivation of CLC-5 and the consequent endosomal dysfunction explain the low-molecular-weight proteinuria in patients with Dent disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107505 \">figure 1</a>). The discovery that mutations in <em>OCRL1</em> can cause the Dent disease phenotype points to overlap in the physiological functions of the OCRL phosphatase and the CLC-5 protein. The OCRL phosphatase also affects endosomal trafficking. Hypercalciuria reflects, at least in part, excessive intestinal absorption and dysregulation of vitamin D metabolism. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations, which are usually present in childhood, include polyuria, microscopic hematuria, asymptomatic proteinuria, and kidney stones (associated with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis). The prevalence of these clinical features among affected males with documented mutations are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74862 \">table 1</a>). In addition, such patients may have glucosuria, aminoaciduria, hyperphosphaturia, chronic kidney disease, hypokalemia, and rickets or osteomalacia.
