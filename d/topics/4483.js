Mechanisms of injury to the conjunctiva include thermal and chemical burns and blunt or penetrating trauma. While injuries can be isolated to the conjunctiva, conjunctival injury can be the presenting sign of underlying intraocular trauma, including open globe injury. Careful evaluation, initial management, and triage of conjunctival injuries are essential to promote appropriate healing of the conjunctiva and other associated ocular injuries.</p><p>The approach to subconjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival abrasions, conjunctival foreign bodies, and conjunctival lacerations will be reviewed here. The treatment of corneal abrasions and foreign bodies and ocular chemical burns are discussed separately.

In patients under 40 years of age, ocular rather than systemic conditions, primarily minor trauma or complications from contact lens use, are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conjunctival-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other causes at any age include coagulopathy (especially in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy), diabetes mellitus, and elevated venous pressure (Valsalva maneuver, coughing, vomiting). Some adult patients report no history of trauma and note the hemorrhage after waking from sleep. Subconjunctival hemorrhage in the setting of significant blunt trauma to the eye may be a sign of globe rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65379 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Conjunctival lacerations are relatively uncommon and may be associated with an open globe, traumatic hyphema, or other serious ocular injury. In a large prospective study of patients presenting to an ocular trauma department, conjunctival or subconjunctival injuries accounted for 4 percent of the 5671 injuries evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conjunctival-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most injuries occurred during work and involved periorbital and superficial ocular structures only. Conjunctival laceration has also resulted from airbag deployment following motor vehicle collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conjunctival-injury/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, several case series and case reports describe conjunctival lacerations in association with penetrating ocular injuries caused by exploded projectiles, eye injury from compressed air hoses, and high velocity blunt trauma from paintball guns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conjunctival-injury/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>Conjunctival foreign bodies most commonly consist of small items like sand, dirt, eye lashes, or plant material. Metal from welding or grinding are also common. Rarely, foreign bodies retained in the conjunctival sac can cause prolonged symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conjunctival-injury/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258343\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258352\"><span class=\"h2\">Subconjunctival hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with subconjunctival hemorrhage may have a history of trauma or contact use or may report no history of trauma and note the hemorrhage after waking from sleep.

In instances of scleral laceration, intraocular blood can leak through the defect and pool in the subconjunctival space, creating a bullous, elevated subconjunctival hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62071\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62071 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79392\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79392 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65379 \">picture 1</a>).

Conjunctival foreign bodies typically cause copious tears and a foreign body sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conjunctival-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If the conjunctival foreign body is embedded under the upper lid, it may cause corneal abrasions with associated pain and photophobia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=slit-lamp-examination#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Slit lamp examination&quot;, section on 'Performing the exam'</a>.) </p><p>The eye should be anesthetized with a topical drop (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proparacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">proparacaine</a>) and the conjunctival laceration explored with a cotton-tip applicator, moistened with sterile water or normal saline. With the aid of a slit lamp, effort should be made to visualize the underlying sclera to ensure that it is intact. If a scleral laceration or prolapsed uvea is visible at any point during the exploration, manipulation of the eye should be stopped and treatment for an open globe initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50022\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50022 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Although probing of a bulbar conjunctival laceration is ideally performed by an ophthalmologist with the aid of a slit lamp, clinicians with expertise in the use of a slit lamp may perform this test in cases where an ophthalmologist is not readily available, and definitive eye care will require prolonged patient transport. In addition to ocular perforation, large conjunctival lacerations can be an entry site for penetrating orbital injury. </p><p>If open globe injury or penetrating injury to the orbit cannot be ruled out in the case of a suspicious conjunctival laceration or a bullous subconjunctival hemorrhage, an orbital CT with thin cuts (&lt;2 mm) should be performed. CT findings of open globe injury include an intraocular foreign body, intraocular air, eye wall deformity, volume loss of the eye, and irregular scleral contour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79392\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79392 \">picture 4</a>). If radiologic evidence of open globe injury or orbital foreign body is present, an eye shield should be placed and ophthalmology should be urgently consulted. However, ocular CT has limited ability to demonstrate an occult open globe injury and should not be used as the sole determining factor for decisions regarding the need for evaluation by an ophthalmologist.

Trauma to the ocular surface frequently involves the conjunctiva.

Most subconjunctival hemorrhages are not associated with intraocular injury. However, in instances of scleral laceration, intraocular blood or fluid can leak through the defect and pool in the subconjunctival space creating a bullous, elevated subconjunctival hemorrhage which may hide the laceration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79392\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79392 \">picture 4</a>).

Identification of an open globe may require probing of the conjunctival laceration during slit lamp examination, preferably by an ophthalmologist.
