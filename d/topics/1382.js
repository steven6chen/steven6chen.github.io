A modest literature on Asperger disorder has emerged since then, though there are no specific clinical features that establish Asperger disorder as distinct from the autism spectrum as a whole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and its status as a separate entity is uncertain. In the DSM-5, published in 2013, Asperger disorder is encompassed within the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has diverse etiologies. It is characterized by a constellation of symptoms that includes deficits in reciprocal social interaction, social communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior (including stereotyped interests and activities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9</a>].

The clinical heterogeneity of autism is indicated with specifiers for severity level and associated conditions (eg, intellectual impairment, language impairment). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>The DSM-5 indicates that individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60599 \">table 1</a>), &ldquo;should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

Consistent with literature that fails to find criteria that clearly distinguish Asperger syndrome from autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there are few studies on Asperger syndrome as a distinct clinical entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Prevalence of Asperger syndrome is usually determined by subgrouping within the autism spectrum and varies widely depending upon the diagnostic criteria used to identify cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>In systematic reviews, the prevalence of Asperger syndrome is estimated to be 6 cases per 10,000 based upon an autistic disorder-to-Asperger syndrome ratio of 3 or 4 to 1, though there are strong limitations of available data on Asperger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Asperger syndrome is more commonly diagnosed in males.

Although the etiology of ASD has yet to be determined, genetic and neurobiologic factors appear to play a prominent role. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-terminology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Case reports and family studies suggest that Asperger syndrome runs in families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Forms of Asperger syndrome have been mapped to chromosome 3q (ASPG1), chromosome 17p (ASPG2), and chromosome 1q21-q22 (ASPG3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The precise neuroanatomical or neurophysiological differences that underlie Asperger syndrome are not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/autism</span> spectrum disorder (ASD) is atypical social development (eg, lack of social awareness, inability to socialize, lack of interest in socializing) accompanied by extreme behavioral rigidity. Atypical social development can be difficult to identify before approximately four years of age, although other symptoms may be present earlier. In a survey of parents of 156 children with Asperger syndrome, the average age at diagnosis was 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, parental concerns were present at an average age of 30 months. The average age of diagnosis for Asperger syndrome may decline as the awareness of the autism spectrum grows.</p><p>Most of the information in this section will also apply to children with ASD of Level 1 severity who do not have intellectual impairment, but who may have language impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis#H534660868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Severity level'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Early features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the preschool years, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may be asymptomatic, may have symptoms that are below the threshold of clinical concern, or may have symptoms related to an associated or comorbid condition (behavior disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or anxiety) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>Before four years of age, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may have delayed use of the nonverbal components of communication (pointing to objects of interest, use of facial expressions or gestures). They may show limited, joint attention and may not always respond to social and communication demands successfully. However, because children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/</span> usually have normal or near-normal language development and can communicate their wants and needs successfully, these atypical features may not appear salient to caregivers. This may partially account for delays in diagnosis. The presence of repetitive behaviors may result in an earlier diagnosis of autism, with a subsequent shift in diagnosis to Asperger syndrome as the child ages.</p><p>After four years of age, when social expectations increase, the atypical social development of children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> becomes more noticeable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Parents and teachers may begin to question social development, identifying a lack of social awareness or social ability, one of the two main diagnostic domains of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79211106\"><span class=\"h2\">Core features</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Social skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal social development and interaction encompass the following types of skills:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication &ndash; Communicating thoughts, intentions, and emotions verbally and nonverbally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social conventions &ndash; Understanding and using social conventions (eg, greetings, waiting turns, following rules, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social reasoning (&quot;theory of mind&quot;) &ndash; Being able to infer the thoughts, intentions, or emotions of others based upon verbal and nonverbal communication (eg, facial expression, gestures, body language).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On-line modification of social behaviors &ndash; Modifying one's behavior during social interactions by considering information obtained through knowledge of the above three components.</p><p/><p>The atypical social development of individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> is usually obvious by the time the child reaches school age if it is not apparent earlier. Day care and preschool staff may notice the child's developmental differences before the parents do, having the benefit of seeing the child interact with same-age peers. The child may solicit the attention of other children or adults inappropriately (eg, by pushing, by approaching the peer while failing to respect personal boundaries, or by immediately initiating a discussion about their preferred topic of interest without checking to see if the peer or adult is listening or even interested). Alternatively, the child may play in the midst of other children without any awareness of what the other children are doing and may not show any ability or effort to join in their play.</p><p>During interactions with the clinician, the child may avoid eye gaze, may gaze too intently, or may gaze at the clinician's mouth or other parts of the face or body instead of directing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> gaze at the eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The child may have an invariant expression and may not use gestures as naturally or spontaneously as other individuals. Sometimes, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> make facial expressions or gestures that are exaggerated or &quot;scripted,&quot; which also makes them appear awkward.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Language skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may perform normally on formal tests of language function (ie, tests that measure vocabulary, syntax, and semantics). However, they do not understand or use language normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29</a>]. Atypical features of language include atypical prosody (rate, rhythm, tone, and volume of speech) and atypical pragmatics (inappropriate use or absence of the nonverbal components of language, inability to produce responses in conversations that are appropriate to the social context). These atypical features are more likely to be apparent after the age of four years. </p><p>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> have difficulty understanding how the meaning of language changes depending upon the nonverbal components of the language and the context. They may not understand, for example, that a change in tone of voice can change the meaning of a word or sentence, or that the same word can have more than one meaning. This makes it difficult for them to understand metaphors, humor, sarcasm, teasing, or <span class=\"nowrap\">jokes/deception,</span> skills that are present in typically developing children by six to seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Although they may be able to produce grammatically correct sentences, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may not know how to use changes in prosody to suit the context (eg, speaking more quietly versus speaking more loudly or speaking in a more theatrical tone of voice). When participating in a conversation, they may provide responses that are unrelated to the topic introduced by the social partner. They may not know how to choose the appropriate words or topics for the given social context. For example, they may speak too bluntly, not respecting differences between familiar and nonfamiliar listeners. When telling a story, they may not consider how much or how little the listener already knows. They may be <span class=\"nowrap\">disorganized/tangential</span> or may focus only on a preferred topic.</p><p>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can be taught to notice ambiguous and social features of language such as those listed in the previous paragraph. However, they generally never fully master all of these subtleties of language. In addition, once they have learned to notice pragmatic functions (eg, sarcasm or humor), they may use them inappropriately (eg, by inappropriately making sarcastic remarks to older peers or adults or by inappropriately attempting to make a joke), or they may misinterpret the comments of a peer as being sarcastic when they were not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may present with behavioral disturbances before their atypical social or language skills are apparent. Behavior disturbances, such as an over-focus on preferred topics or difficulty with organization, can continue throughout life.</p><p>Repetitive and perseverative interests are defining features of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> and are especially obvious when they persist into school age. Although repetitive interests are common in young children, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> are different because their perseverative interests are more specific, unusual, and intense than is the case for their typically developing peers. Interest in mechanical topics, such as trains and cars, or topics from the natural sciences is common. The interest may be very narrow (eg, limited to ceiling fans or vacuum cleaners). They have marked difficulty shifting their attention away from their preferred topic, even when provided with multiple cues, prompts, or requests.</p><p>Inflexibility (cognitive rigidity) is another important behavioral feature in individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>. This feature may be apparent in their choice of conversational topics, but may also be noticeable by their intolerance of changes to their routine or <span class=\"nowrap\">changes/violations</span> of rules of conduct. They are quick to point out differences from what they perceive to be &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;expected.&quot; Changes in routines or rules can provoke temper tantrums <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety.</p><p>Despite their adherence to routines, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can be disorganized and have marked difficulty completing chores or daily tasks. Sometimes this is related to their overfixation on a preferred topic of interest, which diverts their attention away from the more routine tasks of the day. At other times, failure to complete daily tasks may be related to executive dysfunctions, such as remembering, planning, and completing tasks (both routine and novel), and their inability to solve novel problems in real-time situations.</p><p>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may be unusually sensitive to noises, touch, odors, tastes, or visual stimuli. These sensory sensitivities heighten their overall level of arousal and can contribute to inattention, anxiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anger management problems.</p><p>Other behavior disturbances in children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> include anxiety, disruptive behavior disorders (eg, aggression, self-injury), and executive dysfunction, which also occurs in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

However, school performance often declines in third or fourth grade, when reading comprehension and written expression become more important, a consequence of limited pragmatic language skills and social awareness. Children with Asperger syndrome perform especially poorly in topics not related to their preferred interests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when group learning or classroom discussion is required.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Referral for a multidisciplinary evaluation often involves a long waiting period. The primary care provider can facilitate the process by helping the parents to gather information in advance of consultation with the specialist. As an example, the parents could be provided with rating scales for ASD, Asperger syndrome, child psychiatric disorders, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral disorders. Several scales have been designed specifically for Asperger syndrome (eg, Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale, Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale). However, their psychometric properties are not always reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,55</a>], and their utility is debatable given changes in diagnostic classification. A general behavioral screening tool is worthwhile to capture some of the behavioral or atypical features (eg, the Behavior Assessment System for Children [BASC] or the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) and facilitates the assessment of comorbid conditions and other conditions in the differential diagnosis.

The main purposes of school testing are to assess the child's cognitive and educational functioning and language skills. It is useful to ask the school team to look at pragmatic functions specifically, and to assess social skills and behavioral regulation (capacity for self-organization, keeping track of homework and of personal belongings, following routine classroom rules and other rules of conduct).

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Early features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of atypical social development include failure to respect personal boundaries, one-sided conversations about a preferred topic of interest, disregarding the level of interest or knowledge of the listener, lack of interest in or effort to join in activities of other children, abnormal gaze (avoidant or overly intense), and abnormal facial expressions (invariant or exaggerated). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Social skills'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may have normal vocabulary and grammar skills, but abnormal prosody and pragmatics (functional and social use of language). They understand language literally and have difficulty understanding that meaning may change with context. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Language skills'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral features of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> include repetitive and perseverative interests, inflexibility, disorganization, difficulty completing chores or daily tasks, anxiety, disruptive behaviors, executive dysfunction, and sensory sensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric problems that are associated with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> include anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental coordination disorder, depression, and other mood disorders. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of children with suspected autism, including Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> is most effectively conducted by a multidisciplinary team. The central objective is to establish a comprehensive, detailed profile of the child's strengths, weaknesses, and challenges. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The multidisciplinary evaluation should include a history of the child's early development, current symptoms, speech and language evaluation, and neuropsychologic testing to differentiate Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> from other conditions in the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80236 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard for making a diagnosis of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> combines clinical judgment (ie, identification of the clinical features using history and clinical observations) and a formal diagnostic interview (ie, using a diagnostic tool for autism or Asperger syndrome).
