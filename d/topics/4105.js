The incidence in the general population rose from the 1960s to the 1990s, peaked in the mid-1990s, and then declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/1,3-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-13</a>]. Such changes were largely driven by PCNSL cases in men between the ages of 20 and 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, the trend has been attributed in large part to changes in <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> incidence and management over the same time period. By contrast, the incidence rate in adults &gt;65 years of age has steadily risen, even in the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Most cases of non-AIDS-related PCNSL are diagnosed in patients between 45 and 65 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis in the fifth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15-17</a>]. Rare cases have been described in children with a median age of 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>]. Men and women are equally affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDISPOSING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most notable risk factor for the development of PCNSL is immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. This includes HIV infection, iatrogenic immune suppression, and congenital immune deficiency including ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, severe combined and common variable immunodeficiencies, and X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.</p><p>Sporadic PCNSL, in apparently immunocompetent individuals, has been reported in association with other diseases. Antecedent flu-like or gastrointestinal illnesses have been seen in up to 15 percent of patients and many patients with PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, myasthenia gravis, sarcoidosis, and vasculitis may be predisposed to develop either disease- or therapy-related PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Following organ transplants, PCNSL occurs in proportion to the extent of therapeutic immunosuppression. Rarely, patients have experienced a demyelinating disease, either sporadic or Lyme disease related, that anteceded PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cellular and molecular events leading to neoplastic lymphocytic infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) seen in PCNSL remain to be clarified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The CNS normally lacks lymphoid aggregates and it remains speculative whether malignant transformation develops locally within normally trafficking CNS lymphocytes, or systemically in a subpopulation of lymphocytes with specific tropism for the CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Such tropism may be facilitated through the expression of specific cell-surface adhesion molecules, such as CD44 and CD18, and various chemokine receptors (eg, CXCL). Spreading of malignant lymphoid cells within the CNS is believed to involve a complex interaction of selectin and cadherin molecules, such as adhesion molecule CD44 and transmembrane protein receptor Fas (CD95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>The observation that systemic dissemination of PCNSL is rare suggests that the cells of origin in PCNSL may be derived from neoplastic lymphocytes that are eradicated from the periphery by an intact immune system, but which are able to survive in an immunologically aberrant CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The high incidence of PCNSL in immunodeficient states strongly implicates the immune system in the pathogenesis of PCNSL.</p><p>In addition, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may have a causal link to the development of PCNSL and the virus may be oncogenic when detected. Genomic material from EBV has been detected within PCNSL cells in both immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. However, the majority of nonimmunosuppressed patients do not appear to have EBV genomic DNA within their tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, not all patients with EBV DNA in spinal fluid have PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. PCNSL may be a consequence of EBV-mediated clonal expansion and malignant transformation of B-lymphocytes, a process that may be regulated by immune mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>].

Almost all PCNSL cells demonstrate IgHV genes that have high levels of somatic mutations and show intraclonal heterogeneity pointing towards their derivation from mutated germinal center B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, immunohistochemical evaluation suggests that PCNSL are derived from postgerminal center B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCNSL can manifest in the brain, its coverings, the eye, or spinal cord. Five distinct clinicopathologic entities have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,15,16,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,16,33-35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial lesion (solitary or multiple)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse leptomeningeal or periventricular lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Vitreous/uveal</span> deposits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intradural spinal cord lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve-seeking lymphoma (Neurolymphomatosis [NL])</p><p/><p>A sixth entity, intravascular large cell lymphoma, commonly involves the central nervous system (CNS) but is categorized as a variant of systemic large cell lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Presenting symptoms and signs vary, depending on the site of involvement. Although much less common, the clinical presentation of T cell PCNSL appears to be similar to that of B cell PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], possibly with less common eye involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary cerebral lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of PCNSL present as symptoms related to periventricular lesions in the brain. As an example, a retrospective series of 248 immunocompetent patients with primary intracerebral lymphoma reported the following symptoms at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal neurologic deficits &ndash; 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychiatric symptoms &ndash; 43 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of raised intracranial pressure &ndash; 33 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular symptoms &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>Presenting symptoms may include headaches, blurred vision, motor difficulties, and personality changes. The latter may manifest as depression, apathy, psychosis, confusion, memory impairment, slowness of thought, or visual hallucinations. Personality changes are most often associated with lesions of the frontal lobes, periventricular white matter, or corpus callosum. Although a frequent symptom, personality changes tend to develop slowly and remain unnoticed for long periods.</p><p>Visual hallucinations may result from infiltration of visual pathways or the brainstem, or may result from ocular or leptomeningeal involvement. This may result in delayed diagnosis, as it is the later development of motor difficulties, such as hemiparesis or speech disturbances, that usually prompts neurologic evaluation.</p><p>Cranial neuropathies, in particular facial nerve palsies, can occur as a result of either meningeal involvement, infiltration of the brainstem, or invasion of isolated cranial nerves or their roots. Headache, especially late in the course of the disease, may be indicative of increased intracranial pressure or involvement of the leptomeninges.</p><p>While most cases of PCNSL are composed of aggressive lymphoma subtypes such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a small number of patients with indolent CNS lymphoma (eg, mantle cell lymphoma, neurologic chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia) have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. These may mimic meningioma, sometimes involving the dura rather than the brain parenchyma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 40 percent of patients with cerebral PCNSL may have evidence of meningeal involvement at the time of diagnosis based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]; involvement of the leptomeninges by high-risk systemic lymphoma is also a common relapse pattern. On the other hand, primary leptomeningeal lymphoma without synchronous <span class=\"nowrap\">cerebral/spine</span> or systemic disease is very rare, making up less than 10 percent of all cases of PCNSL. Given the rarity of primary leptomeningeal lymphoma, symptomatic leptomeningeal involvement at presentation should prompt serious consideration of an underlying systemic lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with primary leptomeningeal lymphoma present with symptoms and signs of multilevel involvement of the neuraxis, which may include worsening headaches, cranial nerve palsies, meningismus, <span class=\"nowrap\">cervical/lumbar</span> radiculopathies, and hydrocephalus. In an international multicenter retrospective study that identified 48 patients with primary leptomeningeal lymphoma diagnosed over a 30-year period, the most common presenting features were cranial neuropathies (58 percent; especially of the eye and facial movements), spinal symptoms (48 percent), headache (44 percent), leg weakness (35 percent), ataxia (25 percent), and encephalopathy (25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In the same series, the CSF profile was abnormal in all cases, and CSF cytology detected malignant lymphocytes in two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A monoclonal population was detected by flow cytometry and receptor rearrangement studies in 80 and 71 percent of cases, respectively. Multiple CSF samples or meningeal biopsy were commonly required for diagnosis. While the majority of cases were B cell lymphoma, there was a relatively high representation of T cell lymphoma (19 percent), which has been described in other reports as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

It is estimated that 15 to 25 percent of patients with PCNSL will have involvement of the eye. Diagnosis can be made by biopsy of the involved vitreous, choroid, or retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. PIOL should be differentiated from retro-orbital lymphoma, which is frequently associated with systemic extranodal disease. </p><p>Ocular involvement, either unilateral or bilateral, can be the initial presentation of PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In almost half of patients, it precedes the development of clinically evident deposits within the brain parenchyma or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Alternatively, the vitreous and uvea may be a site of relapse in patients with established cerebral lymphoma, or more rarely as a relapse of systemic lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>PIOL tends to involve the posterior segment of the eye, including the vitreous, choroid, or retina, with subsequent development of uveitis (usually chronic and bilateral and occasionally atypical), exudative retinal detachment, and <span class=\"nowrap\">retinal/vitreous</span> hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85793\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85793 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/47,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50</a>]. Occasionally, visual symptoms may follow occlusion of the retinal artery as a result of lymphomatous infiltration. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorescein</a> angiography may help to confirm retinal involvement. If ocular involvement is noted, color photography of the posterior pole of the eye should be obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85794 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The ocular symptoms and findings are frequently subtle and nonspecific and not easily distinguished from those due to sarcoidosis, viral infections, or collagen-vascular diseases. They manifest as <span class=\"nowrap\">obscured/blurred</span> vision, altered visual acuity, floaters, or visual hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/34,47,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,47,51</a>].

Diagnosis, therefore, requires a high degree of suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], referral for slit lamp examination, and careful cytologic and molecular analysis of vitrectomy specimens. Patients diagnosed with ocular involvement should undergo cranial imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture with cytologic examination of the CSF. In one study, positive CSF cytology was found in 35 of 151 patients (23 percent) with ocular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary spinal lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary spinal involvement occurs in less than 1 percent of patients with PCNSL. The lesions are almost always discrete intramedullary nodules. This is in contrast to spinal involvement in systemic lymphoma, where there is usually diffuse leptomeningeal involvement or extradural nodules.</p><p>In either case, spinal cord involvement manifests as a myelopathy. The pattern of weakness and sensory level (if present) will depend on the localization and extent of the lesion. The majority of reported cases of primary spinal lymphoma have involved the lower cervical or upper thoracic regions. </p><p>A single-institution retrospective analysis of 14 patients with primary intramedullary spinal cord lymphoma reported that all patients initially presented with a progressive myelopathy, which was subacute (&lt;8 weeks) in nine patients and insidious (&gt;8 weeks) in five patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The diagnosis was often delayed, with a median time to diagnosis of eight months (range 1 to 22 months).

Most patients had a concomitant lesion in the brain, a biopsy of which confirmed the diagnosis. Three patients had associated comorbidities: one with HIV, one with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and one with intravascular lymphoma.

The majority of cases were due to B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NL was the initial presenting feature in 26 percent of cases and secondary to relapse of systemic or primary CNS lymphoma in the remaining cases. Over half of cases involved multiple neural structures with the following distribution:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral nerves (60 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal nerve roots (48 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial nerves (46 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plexus (40 percent)</p><p/><p>Most patients had both sensory and motor dysfunction on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

For patients who do not have evidence of CSF or ocular involvement, a stereotactic needle biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Nerve biopsy is necessary if isolated neurolymphomatosis (NL) is suspected.

Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain is the preferred imaging modality. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) may be used for patients with contraindications to MRI. Approximately 10 percent of PCNSL are missed on CT scans. MRI may detect lesions missed by CT, although both CT and MRI commonly fail to detect leptomeningeal or vitreal disease. Spinal disease can be detected by MRI.</p><p>Several distinctive radiographic features suggest the diagnosis of PCNSL in immunocompetent individuals. Approximately 50 to 70 percent of immunocompetent patients with PCNSL develop solitary lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], with the remainder (approximately 25 percent) developing multifocal disease. Periventricular lesions (eg, thalamus, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum) are most common (60 percent) followed by lesions in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in 20, 18, 15, and 4 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The radiographic lesion tends to be a solitary nonhemorrhagic mass, situated in the deep white matter adjacent to the ventricular surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The borders are sharply circumscribed in the majority of lesions (87 percent), but may be ill defined (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Although mild surrounding edema is present in the majority of cases, it is usually less profound than that which accompanies metastatic foci of carcinoma. Mass effect and tumor edema are seen in over half of the cases.</p><p>Lesions appear isodense to hyperdense on CT images, isointense to hypointense on T2-weighted MRI images, and enhance homogeneously after contrast administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83271\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83271 \">image 1</a>). Diffusion-weighted MRI images, sensitive to the intracellular water of masses of lymphoma cells, are frequently abnormal, but similar changes may be seen in stroke, other malignant brain tumors, and acute demyelinating diseases. Enhancement of the perivascular component surrounding small blood vessels as they course from the subarachnoid space and penetrate the brain parenchyma (eg, Virchow-Robin space) may be seen. </p><p>Calcification, necrosis, cystic appearance, and ring enhancement are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, cystic appearance may characterize PCNSL in immunocompromised patients. The role of positron emission tomography (PET) scans in diagnosis is unclear. 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) scans of brain may reveal uptake in three-quarters of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] and be used to distinguish glucose-absorbing neoplastic lesions from areas of radiation necrosis, infection, or inflammation, which may also enhance on conventional <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MRI</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Body FDG-PET may also be of value. In a study of 49 patients who had a body PET for staging of PCNSL, systemic lymphoma was identified in 7 percent of newly diagnosed patients and 27 percent of patients with relapsed PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>In cases of NL, conventional brain and spine MRI may be normal. MRI of the involved region of the spine with coronal images through the exiting nerve roots may be required to show characteristic thickening and enhancement of the nerve roots. MRI of the brachial plexus or lumbosacral plexus can also be sensitive to disease in these locations. In most series, FDG-PET is slightly more sensitive than MRI in the evaluation of suspected NL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/57,59,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59,65</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the CSF may reveal the presence of malignant lymphoid cells in up to 40 percent of patients with PCNSL. If no mass effect exists, lumbar puncture should be performed on patients with suspected PCNSL. This examination should be performed either before or at least one week after surgical biopsy to avoid false-positive results.</p><p>The CSF analysis should include cell counts, protein and glucose measurements, cytology, flow cytometry, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangement studies by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The last study is particularly suited to the evaluation of pauci-cellular samples. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Technique, indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CSF often reveals a nonspecific elevated protein concentration and a lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,34,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,34,54</a>]. Glucose concentration is usually normal, but may be lowered in the presence of leptomeningeal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,34</a>]. There may be difficulty distinguishing between reactive and malignant cells or distinguishing reactive cells in the CSF from small cells of medulloblastoma as distinct from malignant B cells. In such cases, immunophenotypic analysis using antibodies against lymphocytic antigens is particularly helpful in establishing the lymphoid origin and clonality of the malignant cells, when present, and to differentiate between B and T cell subtypes.</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of cytomorphologic analysis and PCR analysis of the CSF have not been fully evaluated; each may have false-negative or false-positive results. There is no agreement on a gold-standard test, although most centers favor PCR analysis of rearranged IgH genes. This was best demonstrated in a prospective randomized trial that included 282 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL. Meningeal dissemination was evaluated using CSF cytomorphology, PCR of the rearranged IgH genes, and MRI in conjunction with cell count and protein concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It is not clear if immunophenotypic analysis was performed. PCR and morphologic analysis produced discordant results. Lymphoma cells were confirmed by PCR in only 32 percent of cytomorphologically positive samples while only 35 percent of samples with a monoclonal result on PCR demonstrated lymphoma cells on cytology. These results suggest that both PCR for rearranged IgH genes <strong>and</strong> cytologic examination of the CSF may provide complimentary information regarding meningeal dissemination. It also suggests that serial CSF samples may increase the sensitivity of this analysis. Studies are ongoing to evaluate other methods of CSF analysis, such as the measurement of microRNA levels (either specific for PCNSL or others, such as miR-21, that are overexpressed in brain tumors), nucleotide metabolites such as neopterin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels to differentiate PCNSL from other neurologic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p>The demonstration of neoplastic lymphocytes in the CSF is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of PCNSL and obviates the need for a brain biopsy. However, while a positive CSF analysis can provide valuable diagnostic information, negative results do not exclude PCNSL or the infiltration of the leptomeninges by PCNSL.</p><p>The diagnosis of leptomeningeal involvement can be made by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement of B cells in the CSF</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocytologic identification of clonal B cells in the CSF</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of lymphoma nodules on lumbar nerve roots via scanning procedures such as CT or MRI in patients with pathologically diagnosed PCNSL</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1141750708\"><span class=\"h2\">Slit lamp exam and intraocular biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slit lamp examination is the diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluation of possible ocular disease in patients with suspected or confirmed PCNSL.

Ophthalmic ultrasonography may be a useful adjunctive technique for detecting ocular or retro-bulbar involvement in PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]; additional adjunctive studies that may be used by retinal specialists include fluorescence studies of the ocular fundus and retinal vessels and optical coherence tomography.</p><p>Suspected ocular involvement can be evaluated with biopsy of the vitreous, choroid, or retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Multiple biopsy attempts may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis; as with other sites of disease, exposure to glucocorticoids can reduce the yield of biopsy. Vitrectomy, when combined with cytopathology, flow cytometry, and analysis of IgH gene arrangement, can facilitate diagnosis of vitreous involvement with a sensitivity and specificity of 64 and 100 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In some cases, a chorioretinal biopsy will establish the diagnosis even when prior or concomitant vitrectomy fluid is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Although not validated, some ocular immunologists have come to assume intraocular involvement in the setting of vitreal fluids with elevated ratios of IL-10 to IL-6; the former is elevated in B cell lymphoma while the latter is increased in inflammatory states. At this time, these ratios are considered suggestive, but not diagnostic of intraocular lymphoma, as elevated ratios have been described in nonlymphomatous vitreitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactic needle biopsy of involved tissue is the diagnostic procedure of choice for PCNSL if there is no evidence of ocular or CSF involvement. The reason for this is twofold: patients do not benefit clinically from the surgical resection of PCNSL and their frequent periventricular location increases the risk of surgical complications.</p><p>The pathologic evaluation and classification of PCNSL tumors is similar to that of tumors of systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Tumors are evaluated based upon their morphology and immunophenotype. The vast majority of PCNSL tumors (80 to 85 percent) are of the aggressive or highly aggressive, diffuse large cell subtypes, and almost all are of B cell phenotypic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,4,11,15,74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11,15,74-76</a>].</p><p>However, the relative frequency of different lymphoma subtypes may differ by geography. As an example, an analysis from Korea reported 7 of 42 patients were found to have PCNSL of T cell origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Primary CNS Hodgkin lymphoma and low-grade PCNSL are extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The latter has a better long-term outcome than aggressive histology PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>The most common histopathologic subtype of PCNSL is diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). As examples, a series of 33 patients with PCNSL reported that all of these tumors were DLBCL, with the vast majority being of the centroblastic subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The majority was positive for BCL6, MUM1, and BCL2; all were negative for CD138. Similar results were seen in a series of 51 patients with HIV-unrelated PCNSL and a histologic diagnosis of DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Positivity for MUM1, BCL6, BCL2, CD10, or CD138 was seen in 84, 61, 49, 18, and 0 percent, respectively. The diagnosis of DLBCL is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tumors tend to infiltrate along the perivascular spaces and surrounding parenchyma, occasionally invading the blood vessel wall. The vast majority of these tumors are composed of large immunoblastic and centroblastic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>]. Endothelial proliferation and cyst formation are uncommon.</p><p>The edges of the infiltrating growth often contain mixtures of tumor cells, reactive astrocytes, and T lymphocytes. T cells appear within the spinal fluid. In one study, reactive perivascular T cell infiltrates (RPVIs) were found in 36 percent of 73 assessable cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic evaluation of tissue obtained from masses suspected to be PCNSL. Some patients may be diagnosed based upon the pathologic evaluation of vitreal biopsies or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1141750708\" class=\"local\">'Slit lamp exam and intraocular biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients without ocular or CSF involvement, stereotactic brain biopsy is usually the method of choice, providing a high rate of positive tissue diagnosis, with a low rate (&lt;2 percent) of morbidity and mortality. Extensive resection of the lesion(s) is impractical in the majority of cases, given the deep location of the lesions and predisposition of the disease to involve multiple areas of the brain. Moreover, resection results in high rates of complication and does not improve prognosis.</p><p>In general, we avoid the use of corticosteroids prior to biopsy, as these agents are lymphocytotoxic; a single injection is known to alter proper histopathologic evaluation, and a short course of treatment may cause the tumor to disappear temporarily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/82-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-85</a>].

Occasionally, the initial specimen fails to confirm the pathologic diagnosis of PCNSL. The pathology may be suggestive of &quot;inflammation,&quot; &quot;demyelination,&quot; or &quot;viral encephalitis.&quot; These may represent sentinel lesions eventually progressing into lymphoma, since some patients with these findings have returned with new lesions that are pathologically proven to be PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,4,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,34</a>]. Similarly uncertain diagnoses may accompany partially treated PCNSL or biopsies performed on the edge of the tumor.</p><p>Occasional cases can be diagnosed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques on tissue biopsies or cells from the CSF by showing clonal rearrangements of the T cell receptor or immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. As the PCR primers employed do not include the entire range of possible rearranged sites, and as some PCNSL may be initially polyclonal in nature, the IgH analyses, at present, have a sensitivity of approximately 70 percent. T cell receptor gene rearrangements are occasionally identified in pathologically confirmed B cell PCNSL.</p><p>Once a diagnosis of PCNSL is made, a thorough evaluation of the central nervous system (CNS), systemic organs, and bone marrow is critical in order to determine the full extent of disease and guide appropriate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

The peritumoral edema surrounding most glial tumors and metastatic lesions is uncommonly encountered in PCNSL. Calcification, hemorrhage, necrosis, cystic appearance, and ring enhancement pattern are uncommon in PCNSL in immunocompetent individuals. Their presence should raise the possibility of PCNSL in the setting of immunosuppression or a diagnosis other than PCNSL. In the setting of immunosuppression, PCNSL may coexist with brain abscess, tuberculoma, or other infectious complications.</p><p>Occasionally, dural-based lymphomas may mimic a meningioma. These tumors may also be mistaken for inflammatory pseudotumors of the dura, plasma cell granulomas, Castleman disease, Rosai-Dorfman disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the skull extending into the dura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,34</a>]. </p><p>Pathologically, diseases of small &quot;blue cells&quot; similar to lymphoma include primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), undifferentiated carcinoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, metastatic amelanotic melanoma, and toxoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Immunohistochemical studies are invaluable in this regard. In particular, leukocyte common antigen (CD45) can help to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
