Sleep quality generally remains unaffected, but the events lead to significant worry for the parents or the patient. The events are most common in preschool-aged children, and they gradually decrease in frequency over the first decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The events may mimic sleep-related epileptic seizures; thus, it is important to understand their clinical and sleep laboratory diagnostic features. Sometimes parasomnias are isolated symptoms in an otherwise healthy child, while on other occasions they coexist with neurologic, psychiatric, or medical disorders. This article provides an overview of common parasomnias of childhood. &#160;</p><p>Parasomnias involve relatively complex behaviors. Simpler and stereotyped movements are categorized as sleep-related movement disorders. These include restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movements of sleep, sleep-related bruxism, and sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder, and are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related movement disorders in childhood&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172745\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies of parasomnias in childhood have provided cross-sectional data. There are few longitudinal studies. </p><p>Young children (aged 2.5 to 6 years) were evaluated in a large study in Quebec, Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Parasomnias were ubiquitous: 88 percent of the cohort manifested at least one parasomnia during the study period. Parasomnias or other sleep-related movements were noted at the following frequencies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep terrors &ndash; 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleepwalking &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep enuresis &ndash; 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruxism (teeth grinding) &ndash; 46 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhythmic movement disorder (eg, head banging) &ndash; 9 percent </p><p/><p>Older children (aged 6 to 11 years) were evaluated as part of the Tucson Children's Assessment of Sleep Apnea Study (TuCASA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each parasomnia was noted by parents with the following frequency at baseline, and remission rate approximately five years later:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep terrors &ndash; 0.6 percent at baseline, 100 percent resolved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleepwalking &ndash; 6 percent at baseline, 65 percent resolved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep talking &ndash; 1 percent at baseline, 50 percent resolved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep enuresis &ndash; 0.3 percent at baseline, 71 percent resolved</p><p/><p>One limitation in estimates of incidence and prevalence of parasomnias during childhood is that they are based mainly on parental recall. Another is that mild and infrequent parasomnias, such as a confusional arousal with no vocalization may not even come to parental attention. There does not seem to be a gender predisposition for any specific parasomnia. Some parasomnias show a familial predisposition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172752\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most parasomnias are associated with a specific type of sleep (rapid eye movement [REM] or non-rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep). This characteristic is used in the classification scheme outlined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Common parasomnias and other behaviors during sleep are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69704\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69704 \">table 1</a>) and detailed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172788\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS OF AROUSAL FROM NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (NREM) SLEEP</span></p><p>Confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking are the most significant parasomnias associated with NREM sleep. They are also termed disorders of partial arousal as they result from incomplete arousal from NREM sleep. Typically, they occur at the transition from deep NREM (stage N3) sleep into the lighter stages of NREM sleep (N1 or N2) or into the awake state. They are most likely to arise during the first third of nocturnal sleep because N3 sleep is most prevalent at this time of the night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These parasomnias have distinct clinical manifestations, but the underlying pathophysiology and course are similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81349 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17024214\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above mentioned three parasomnias that occur on arousal from NREM sleep have similar predisposing characteristics and triggers, suggesting common pathophysiology: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic predisposition &ndash; Several studies have shown familial patterns for these parasomnias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study of 323 pairs of twins (199 monozygotic, 124 dizygotic), the pair-wise concordance for sleepwalking was six times higher in the monozygotic twins than in the dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Another study found that sleep terrors were twice as common in children whose parents had exhibited sleepwalking (47.4 percent) as compared with children whose parents did not (22.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased arousal from sleep &ndash; Disorders that increase arousals from sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement of sleep, or gastroesophageal reflux are common triggers for arousal parasomnias. In a study of 84 children with recurrent or chronic sleepwalking, 58 percent had a history suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea, the treatment of which frequently led to resolution of sleepwalking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Separation anxiety also may be a predisposing factor for both sleep terrors and sleepwalking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other triggers &ndash; Sleep deprivation and fever are common triggers for all three parasomnias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Vulnerability to these parasomnias is also influenced by age; these disorders are most common in childhood and gradually resolve by adolescence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electroencephalogram (EEG) &ndash; Arousal parasomnias are associated with increased frequency of cyclic alternating patterns on sleep EEG. These are repeated and spontaneous high voltage patterns that recur at regular intervals of up to two minutes in duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They are a reliable marker of unstable sleep and are increased during the slow wave sleep of children with sleep terrors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17024133\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking are typically seen in toddlers and school-aged children. Sometimes, more than one of these parasomnias may be seen in the same child. Most patients show gradual, spontaneous resolution of the events over months to years, although sleepwalking is somewhat more likely to persist into adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H27172745\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172803\"><span class=\"h3\">Confusional arousals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confusional arousals are most commonly reported in toddlers and usually diminish in frequency after five years of age. In a population-based study, the prevalence in children 3 to 13 years of age was 17.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The onset of symptoms is typically within two to three hours of sleep onset but also may occur upon attempted awakening from sleep during the night or in the morning. The child will typically sit up in bed, whimper, cry, or moan, and may utter words like &quot;no&quot; or &quot;go away,&quot; appear distressed, and remain inconsolable regardless of all effort at soothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is generally no sweating, flushing of the face, or stereotypic motor behavior. The child may remain sitting in the bed. The duration is 5 to 30 minutes. A simultaneously recorded EEG may show generalized, high amplitude rhythmic delta or theta activity.<em> </em>The following morning, the patient awakens, feeling alert and refreshed, and has no recollection of the event whatsoever. The events, though benign, lead to significant parental concern, worry, and puzzlement about the nature of the events and how to deal with them. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172810\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep terrors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep terrors typically occur between 4 and 12 years of age.<em> </em>The events occur during the first third of nocturnal sleep. The child awakens abruptly from sleep with a loud scream, is agitated, and has a flushed face, sweating, and tachycardia. The child may jump out of bed as if running away from an unseen threat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and is usually unresponsive to parental efforts at calming. The child usually does not remember the episode later. </p><p>A simultaneously obtained EEG may show high amplitude, rhythmic delta, or theta activity. There is a strong genetic predisposition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172817\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleepwalking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleepwalking, like the other parasomnias associated with NREM sleep, occurs in about 15 percent of children, peaking between age 8 and 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Mild episodes, in which a toddler sits up and crawls around the bed or walks up quietly to stand by the bed of the parents, may initially go unnoticed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>]. Other children may become agitated and run around the house or have inappropriate behaviors. Some patients have injured themselves by unconsciously carrying out dangerous behaviors like leaving the house on cold, wintry nights and have had consequences like accidental hypothermia. Autonomic dysfunction may coexist in the form of sweating and flushing of the face. Some patients exhibit a combination of sleep terrors and sleep walking, though one type predominates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172825\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nocturnal seizures</strong> &ndash; Nocturnal seizures can mimic sleepwalking, confusional arousals, or sleep terrors. Disorganized bodily movements, staring, unresponsiveness, vocalizations, and confused behavior are common to both seizures and these parasomnias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. A number of features including age of onset and nocturnal pattern help distinguish these parasomnias from seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188 \">table 3</a>). Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy can be sporadic or familial, in some cases due to mutations in the genes <em>CHRNA2</em>, <em>CHRNA4,</em> or <em>CHRNB2 </em>that<em> </em>regulate the expression of nicotinic acetyl choline receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. A 16 to 18 channel EEG montage should be incorporated into the polysomnogram for the investigation of any nocturnal events that are suspected to be seizures. Home video recordings of the spells made by the parents are invaluable aids in diagnosis because a stay in the artificial environment of the sleep laboratory is not consistently associated with capture of the nocturnal events. Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes and clinical features that help distinguish nocturnal seizures from parasomnias are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Sleep disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux</strong> &ndash; Gastroesophageal reflux can lead to episodes of abrupt arousal from sleep in association with crying or tonic extension of the trunk and extremities. A simultaneously obtained EEG fails to reveal epileptiform abnormalities. There may be an associated cough. Reflux episodes may also occur during wakefulness. The suspicion of reflux can be supported by esophageal pH monitoring (obtained after consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist), but a firm association between reflux and the arousal is difficult to establish unless the events are captured simultaneously during the pH monitoring study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Panic attacks</strong> &ndash; Panic attacks are characterized by an abrupt awakening from NREM sleep with a sensation of choking or tightness in the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The EEG remains normal. The events may last a few minutes and then subside. Daytime episodes of anxiety also may occur. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172832\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most healthy children presenting with sleepwalking, confusional arousals, or night terrors require only a focused history and physical examination for diagnosis. Parasomnias that are infrequent (one to two times per month) or that have typical triggers such as sleep deprivation or fever generally do not require further investigation, especially if there is a family history of childhood parasomnias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172840\"><span class=\"h3\">Investigations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with frequent parasomnias, indications for nocturnal polysomnography (PSG, sleep study) include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Habitual snoring, observed apneas, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> daytime somnolence, behavioral problem, or mood disturbance, suggesting underlying obstructive sleep apnea as a potential trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg discomfort or involuntary jerking movements during sleep suggestive of restless leg syndrome or periodic limb movements of sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safety concerns because of dangerous behaviors during the parasomnia, excessive disruption of the family members' sleep, or if pharmacotherapy is contemplated. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical features that raise concern for nocturnal seizures, including daytime neurological symptoms, highly stereotyped behaviors, older age group, multiple occurrences on a single night <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> very frequent occurrences (eg, several nights each week) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94628 \">table 4</a>). In this case, the PSG should include a 16 to 18 channel electroencephalogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27172825\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p>If the PSG shows greater than five periodic limb movements per hour of sleep or there is a history of restless legs syndrome, the serum ferritin level should be measured. A low serum ferritin (eg, below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L)</span> is a marker for iron deficiency, which is present in up to 75 percent of children with restless legs syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea is suggested if the PSG reveals more than one obstructive apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep (apnea-hypopnea index &ge;1), increased respiratory event-related arousals, or increased levels of end tidal carbon dioxide. The interpretation of the PSG features of sleep apnea is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172848\"><span class=\"h3\">General strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infrequently occurring (one to two times per month) confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking do not need to be treated. Parents should be informed about the benign and self-limiting nature of the disturbance, and that the symptoms usually will resolve spontaneously over one to two years. Toddlers should be given adequate time to nap during the day because sleep deprivation may be a trigger for the parasomnia. In the case of sleepwalking, the clinician should discuss environmental safety issues with the parents, such as ensuring that the child is not able to leave the house or otherwise injure him or herself while sleepwalking. Unless the child is in a position to get injured, parents should be advised to not restrain or awaken the child as this may exacerbate the disturbance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172856\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical/surgical strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no specific underlying triggers are found and the parasomnias remain problematic, we suggest a low dose of a benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonazepam</a> in a dose of 0.125 to 0.5 mg at bed time). </p><p>If the serum ferritin level is below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> in a child with restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements of sleep, we suggest oral iron therapy 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day with orange juice or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin C</a> for four to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The objective is to raise the serum ferritin level to 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span>. This is because the parasomnia may be triggered by restless legs syndrome, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H27172840\" class=\"local\">'Investigations'</a> above.) </p><p>If the PSG indicates mild obstructive sleep apnea (eg, an apnea hypopnea index between one and three events per hour), and if there are no symptoms suggestive of more severe sleep apnea, it is reasonable to do a trial of treatment with nasal corticosteroids (one puff twice a day) combined with saline nasal spray (one spray two to three times a day). If this treatment fails to resolve the parasomnia, or if the PSG shows moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index &ge;3 events per hour), a referral should be made to a pediatric otolaryngologist to evaluate the child for possible adenotonsillectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172863\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticipatory awakening (scheduled awakening) is a behavioral technique that can be utilized to prevent these parasomnias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Because these events generally occur during the first third of the night, momentary awakening of the child by the parent, about 15 to 20 minutes prior to the usual time of occurrence may alter the sleep state and abort the event. During the scheduled awakening attempt, the parent comforts the child and generally behaves as he or she would when awakened by the child. In one report of three children with frequent sleep walking, nightly anticipatory awakenings for one month led to near-resolution of the symptom, and the improvement continued at follow up six months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Anecdotal reports from the children's parents suggest that the scheduled awakenings may have conditioned the children to self-arouse prior to transitioning from slow-wave sleep, but this hypothesis has not been further examined. </p><p>Although the efficacy of scheduled awakenings has not been well tested in clinical studies, the technique may be worth trying when the family is reluctant to administer medications and is inclined towards non-pharmacologic management. It has the potential drawback of actually triggering a parasomnia by the awakening procedure. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172877\"><span class=\"h1\">PARASOMNIAS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172885\"><span class=\"h2\">Nightmare disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nightmares are disturbing dreams that awaken the dreamer. They are also referred to as dream anxiety attacks. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3 defines nightmares as &quot;an internally generated conscious experience or dream sequence that seems vivid and real. They have a tendency to become increasingly more disturbing as they unfold. Emotions are characteristically negative and most frequently involve anxiety, fear, or terror but may also involve anger, rage, embarrassment, and disgust.&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Full alertness generally returns immediately upon awakening after a nightmare and recall of the dream experience remains intact. Since REM sleep predominates during the final third of the night, nightmares generally occur in the early hours of the morning. </p><p>The recall of dream content is good in children who are verbal. The description of dreams in preschool age children may be simple, but more elaborate in older children. Nightmares are more common in children with post-traumatic stress disorder, and their dream content may be particularly distressing, with themes of inflicted violence, death, or separation from close family members. </p><p>Bodily movement is infrequent because muscle tone and mobility are actively inhibited during REM sleep. Autonomic manifestations like sweating and flushing of the face also do not occur. Mild tachycardia may occur. The duration of the event is generally brief. After waking up, the child may find it hard to fall back to sleep. </p><p>The association between anxiety symptoms and nightmares was explored in a group of 610 children who were evaluated at the ages of 13 and 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Anxiety symptoms were classified based on DSM-III criteria for separation anxiety, overanxious disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. As compared to boys, girls were more likely to report disturbing dreams, and the symptom tended to increase over time. The frequent occurrence of disturbing dreams at age 13 years was associated with generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, or overanxious disorder at age 16 years for both boys and girls. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172892\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polysomnography is not routinely indicated for the investigation of nightmares. When nightmares are recurrent and problematic, psychological evaluation is indicated to assess for anxiety and determine its underlying causes. </p><p>Medications are rarely indicated for treatment of nightmares. Triggers for nightmares include certain medications, including antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antihistamines. Behavioral techniques to manage nightmares in children are based on observations from small, non-randomized case series, and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reassurance &ndash; Some nightmares may subside simply with reassurance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rescripting &ndash; Rescripting techniques in which children are taught to create new, more pleasant endings to recurring nightmares may lessen their distress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization &ndash; Desensitization techniques may also help alleviate the fear of nightmares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Some therapists have found it useful to encourage the child to write down the content of the nightmare, or draw pictures of the object(s) which may help make the experience less scary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypnotherapy &ndash; A small case series suggested that one or two sessions of hypnotherapy will help adults and children with nightmares, with <span class=\"nowrap\">5/7</span> (71 percent) remaining free of nightmares or much improved at 18 months follow up, and <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> (67 percent) remaining free of nightmares after five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) &ndash; CBT may be of value in cases of intense, disturbing nightmares but is not well studied in children or adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Techniques include imagery rehearsal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172907\"><span class=\"h2\">REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by aggressive motor behavior as part of dream enactment, resulting from loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep and often leading to injury of the patient or bed partner. At the end of an episode, the dreamer typically awakens quickly and is able to recall the dream content, which tends to correspond to the observed sleep behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast with the arousal parasomnias discussed above, RBD tends to occur during the later part of the night, when REM sleep predominates. </p><p>RBD occurs in less than 1 percent of adults (usually in men older than 50 years), in whom it is predictive of neurodegenerative disorders that lead to accumulation of synuclein in the central nervous system, including Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and Lewy Body dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In younger adults, RBD is more likely to be idiopathic or associated with narcolepsy, and there is less male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. RBD also may be associated with narcolepsy or use of antidepressant medications including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The mechanism appears to be loss of inhibition of the descending motor projections from the brainstem onto the spinal cord, due to structural or functional lesions in the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum or the medullary ventral gigantocellular nucleus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies#H2636670739\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;, section on 'REM sleep behavior disorder'</a>.)</p><p>RBD also occurs in children. It is rare, but also probably under-recognized. Case reports describe two girls aged seven and nine years with combined REM sleep behavior disorder and narcolepsy-cataplexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The largest series of children with RBD to date (n = 15) reveals a preponderance of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, Smith Magenis syndrome and Rett syndrome, structural brainstem abnormalities such as Chiari type I malformation, narcolepsy, a medication effect from SSRIs, or withdrawal from barbiturates or alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The long-term outcome of childhood RBD is not known, but the clinical course may differ from that of adults with this disorder because there does not seem to be an association with neurodegeneration involving synuclein. </p><p>Home video observations are helpful in diagnosis and often document yelling, agitation, or flailing of the limbs, although these behaviors may be absent when sleep is recorded in a sleep laboratory. The nocturnal polysomnogram demonstrates a lack of the chin muscle atonia that normally characterizes physiologic REM sleep. This is known as REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) and is a neurophysiological correlate of RBD, even in the absence of RBD episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Excessive twitching and movement of the limbs during REM sleep also may occur. </p><p>Treatment recommendations for RBD are based on small case series in adults and anecdotal experience in children. If the patient is taking medications known to exacerbate RBD (which include SSRIs), discontinuation of the medication (when possible) may lead to improvement or resolution of the RBD. As in adults, RBD in children responds promptly to treatment with benzodiazepines like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonazepam</a>, 0.125 to 0.5 mg at bed time. Melatonin appears to be useful for adults with RBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]; in children we have used a dose of 1 to 3 mg at bedtime with some success. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with compressive brainstem lesions such as Chiari malformation require treatment measures directed specifically to these disorders. The same applies to neurodevelopmental disabilities like Smith-Magenis syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chiari-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chiari malformations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H86262802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '17p11.2 deletion syndrome (Smith-Magenis syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17023859\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasomnia overlap disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parasomnia overlap disorder consists of RBD and another parasomnia (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals), or rhythmic movement disorder occurring in the same patient, and has been reported in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Like RBD, many of the cases are associated with underlying neurologic disease. Obstructive sleep apnea or other causes of partial arousal from both NREM and REM sleep should also be considered. However, idiopathic disease also occurs and is more common among patients presenting with parasomnia overlap disorder at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17024029\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle atonia and transient skeletal muscle paralysis are physiologic properties of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These phenomena may however sometimes intrude onto wakefulness around the time of sleep onset or at the time of waking up from sleep. The resulting transient inability to move the body is called sleep paralysis. Recurrent sleep paralysis is often associated with narcolepsy. If it is not associated with narcolepsy, it is known as isolated sleep paralysis (ISP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Narcolepsy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>During a sleep paralysis episode, consciousness remains intact, and the individual is perfectly aware of the surroundings. For a patient unfamiliar with the phenomenon, a terrifying feeling can arise from the sudden inability to move the body while being fully awake, albeit momentarily. The child may also experience hallucinations such as feeling the presence of others nearby, feeling pressure on the chest, or hearing footsteps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of young adults with anxiety disorder may manifest ISP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Sleep deprivation in otherwise healthy teenagers is also a common trigger. The differential diagnosis includes partial seizures, periodic paralysis, and narcolepsy. Occasional events are generally due to sleep deprivation and do not require treatment. Recurrent episodes may be very bothersome to the patient. Treatment approaches have not been evaluated. For patients with an underlying anxiety disorder, treatment for the anxiety is appropriate and may alleviate the ISP. In our practice, we have had some success treating ISP with REM-suppressing agents such as low doses of tricyclic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonazepam</a>. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172945\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER PARASOMNIAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27172953\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep enuresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep enuresis (also known as nocturnal enuresis) is defined as discrete episodes of urinary incontinence during sleep at least twice per week in children older than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/3,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,42</a>]. This age threshold is used because most children achieve control of the bladder by this age. Recurrent nocturnal enuresis affects approximately 15 percent of five-year-old children, and gradually declines to about 5 percent by 10 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58087 \">figure 1</a>). Enuretic episodes can occur in all sleep stages, including during the sleep-wake transition. &#160;</p><p>Primary enuresis refers to a child who has never achieved a period of dryness at night. This form is most common and has a strong familial pattern. Secondary enuresis describes a child who develops enuresis after a period of six or more months of nighttime dryness. Secondary enuresis is more likely to be associated with acquired factors such as urinary tract infection, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and psychological disturbances such as a stressful event. &#160;</p><p>OSA is increasingly recognized as a cause of some cases of nocturnal enuresis. Among 69 children with nocturnal enuresis, more than half had symptoms suggestive of OSA (using a standardized questionnaire) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In a different study using polysomnography to diagnose OSA, there was an association between OSA severity and nocturnal enuresis in girls, but not in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Conversely, among children with established OSA, up to 40 percent have a history of nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Among children with enuresis and OSA, the enuresis usually resolves if the OSA is treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The possibility of OSA should be considered in children presenting with nocturnal enuresis, particularly if they have one or more of the following characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Habitual snoring or observed apneas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenotonsillar hypertrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mouth-breathing </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary enuresis &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p>Further evaluation of a child with suspected OSA, including the indications for and interpretation of a polysomnogram (sleep study), is discussed separately.

Most parasomnias occur at sleep onset or are associated with a specific type of sleep (rapid eye movement [REM] or non-rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep). (See <a href=\"#H27172745\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27172752\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking have distinct clinical manifestations, but the underlying pathophysiology and course is similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81349 \">table 2</a>). Because they are associated with arousal from deep NREM sleep, they tend to occur during the first third of the night. There is a strong familial tendency. Triggers include any disorder that increases arousals from sleep, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, sleep deprivation, or fever. (See <a href=\"#H17024214\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17024133\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otherwise healthy children who present with these parasomnias often require only a focused history and physical examination for diagnosis. Parasomnias that are infrequent (one to two times per month) or that have typical triggers such as sleep deprivation or fever generally do not require further investigation. The clinician can reassure the parent about the benign nature of the disturbance and that it will probably resolve spontaneously over one to two years. The family should ensure that the child has adequate sleep. In the case of sleep walking, environmental safety issues should also be discussed.
