Blocks are often used to avoid the effects of alternative anesthetics or analgesics. The most common rationale for their use is to avoid side effects and complications of general anesthesia (GA), particularly respiratory-related effects, and to provide analgesia while minimizing opioid use.</p><p>Examples of circumstances in which PNBs might be preferable to GA as a sole anesthetic include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at risk of respiratory depression related to GA (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, severe obesity, underlying pulmonary disease, advanced age) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected difficult airway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who desire to remain conscious or avoid systemic medications (eg, fear of GA, pregnancy)</p><p/><p>PNBs might be preferable to neuraxial anesthesia as a sole anesthetic in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients on antithrombotic medication or with a coagulopathy (only applies to PNBs in a compressible location)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom sympathetic blockade may cause hemodynamic problems (eg, aortic stenosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at high risk of urinary retention</p><p/><p>PNBs might provide the optimal means of analgesia in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at risk of respiratory depression related to systemic or neuraxial opioids (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, severe obesity, underlying pulmonary disease, advanced age)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with another indication to minimize opioid use (eg, chronic opioid use, intolerance to opioids)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatients who will benefit from prolonged profound analgesia (using long-acting local anesthetics or continuous PNB)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute, severe pain, poorly managed with systemic medication</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184106062\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few absolute contraindications to the use of PNBs; these include patient refusal or inability to cooperate and allergy to local anesthetics.

The risk is greatest with deep blocks (eg, paravertebral, lumbar plexus, infraclavicular) in which compression of bleeding vessels is not possible, or in which an expanding hematoma would not be readily apparent. It may be reasonable to proceed with a PNB in a patient with abnormal coagulation status when the benefit of the block is felt to be greater than the risk of bleeding and any significant bleeding would be both apparent and manageable.</p><p>We follow the guidelines of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) Practice Advisory for timing of blocks and antithrombotic medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] for patients having paravertebral, deep plexus, or peripheral nerve blocks not amenable to direct vascular compression. These guidelines are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87862 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication&quot;</a>). Superficial blocks may be performed safely in anticoagulated patients in whom the benefits of the block are felt to be greater than the risk of bleeding.</p><p>Surgical patients on chronic antithrombotic medication usually have the medication discontinued or dosing modified to minimize surgical bleeding; if the medical condition of the patient requires continuation of antithrombotic medication, we do not perform &quot;deep&quot; nerve blocks. Management of antithrombotic medication in the perioperative period is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bleeding from inadvertent vascular puncture during placement of a PNB may lead to nerve damage or significant blood loss. Nerve damage can result when a hematoma causes nerve compression within a closed space; this is of great concern with neuraxial blocks, but less common with PNBs. Significant blood loss is more common than neurologic damage in case reports of PNBs complicated by bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Continuous blocks are useful in patients who are expected to have prolonged need for analgesia. This technique may increase patient satisfaction by decreasing pain, opioid use and side effects, and sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184103823\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A directed medical history should include conditions that may impact the decision to perform a block, such as coagulopathy, respiratory compromise or pulmonary blebs (when a brachial plexus block is planned), or inability to use crutches (when a lower extremity block is planned). It is prudent to examine the patient for preexisting sensory or motor deficits in the distribution of the block; a patient with neurologic deficits may be more likely to develop new neurologic deficits following a block than a patient without preexisting deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The patient should be made familiar with precautions and care needed during recovery of the block, as well as potential delayed complications.</p><p>Patients who receive a nerve block as a surgical anesthetic should follow normal fasting guidelines for surgery, whether or not general anesthesia is planned as deep sedation or general anesthesia may be necessary in cases of inadequate block.</p><p>Intravenous access should be obtained in all patients receiving a nerve block for a surgical procedure, due to the risk of complications such as vasovagal events, inadvertent IV injection, and local anesthetic toxicity, as well as the possible use of sedative medication(s). Lipid emulsion 20 percent and equipment for resuscitation should be available when any nerve block is placed.

Many experts feel that the use of these techniques decreases the risk of nerve trauma, but this has not been demonstrated, possibly due to the low baseline incidence of nerve injury.</p><p>We use ultrasound guidance rather than nerve stimulation for primary nerve localization for most peripheral nerve blocks. We suggest <strong>not</strong> using paresthesias to localize nerves for peripheral nerve block, because of the risk of nerve injury.

There was no difference in the rate of postoperative neurologic complications.</p><p>Patients in whom ultrasound guidance may be particularly advantageous include those with challenging anatomy (ie, scarring from previous surgeries, obese patients) and in those for whom improved visualization may improve safety, such as patients with abnormal coagulation status. Ultrasound may also be useful to &quot;rescue&quot; a block that is inadequate or incomplete, which may not be possible with a nerve stimulation technique. The nerve remains visible by ultrasound following local anesthetic injection, allowing the block to be repeated. In contrast, nerve stimulation is not possible once the nerve has been exposed to local anesthetic.</p><p>Disadvantages of ultrasound guidance include the need for specialized training, including use of ultrasound equipment and manipulation of needles under ultrasound guidance; these techniques can be more complex than nerve stimulator use in some situations. The equipment is also considerably more expensive than nerve stimulation equipment, including both ultrasound machines and sterile ultrasound probe covers.</p><p>An overview of the equipment and technique for ultrasound guidance for peripheral nerve block is discussed here. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound for peripheral nerve blocks&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2169832650\"><span class=\"h3\">Equipment for ultrasound guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portable ultrasound machines provide imaging of adequate quality for the placement of PNBs. A variety of ultrasound machines are available.</p><p>The high-frequency (10 to 15 MHz) probe is used to identify more superficial nerves (eg, upper extremity blocks), whereas low-frequency (5 to 7 MHz) probes provide greater tissue penetration for identification of deeper nerves (eg, sciatic nerve blocks).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61524531\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique for ultrasound guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After aseptic skin preparation, anatomic structures at the block site are identified using an ultrasound probe in a sterile plastic sheath with sterile conductive gel. These structures include the target nerve and other nearby nerves, blood vessels, and bony and soft tissue structures (eg, lung). When the optimal ultrasound view is achieved (by rotating, tilting, or moving the probe), the probe is held immobile; the block needle is then advanced, with movement only when the needle tip is seen. If the tip disappears from view, it may be located using hydro-localization (injecting small increments of saline or local anesthetic).</p><p>Structures of interest can be imaged either in the short-axis (cross-section) or the long-axis. A short-axis view becomes a long-axis view when the transducer is turned 90&deg; in either direction. In general, regional anesthesiologists prefer to image nerves and blood vessels in short-axis, with a simultaneous anterior-posterior and lateral-medial perspective and use of color Doppler imaging to recognize blood vessels. In the long-axis view, the lateral-medial perspective is lost.</p><p>Two techniques are used for needle insertion: &quot;in-plane&quot; and &quot;out-of-plane&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97800 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using the in-plane approach, the needle is inserted parallel to the long side of the transducer and is visualized in long-axis so the full needle is visualized. This permits the tip of the needle to be visualized at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the out-of-plane view of the needle, a cross-section of the needle appears as a small dot (which can be difficult to see). It can be very challenging to maintain a view of the needle throughout the entire procedure, and it is difficult to distinguish the tip from other portions of the needle; this may increase the potential for direct needle trauma to blood vessels and nerves. The needle is inserted perpendicular to the long axis of the transducer. Out of plane technique is often used for deeper blocks where it is more difficult to visualize the entire length of the needle to the target nerve. </p><p/><p>In contrast to the nerve stimulation technique, in which the local anesthetic is placed in a single location, using ultrasound, local anesthetic may be injected in multiple locations under direct vision to improve blockade of all portions of the nerve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve stimulator guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The equipment used for nerve stimulator guidance is less expensive than the equipment required for ultrasound guidance. There is concern that nerve stimulation may cause a higher incidence of nerve trauma than ultrasound guidance, as it does not allow direct visualization of needle and nerve, but studies have not confirmed this.</p><p>Use of nerve stimulation relies on anatomic knowledge of the approximate location of the target nerve for the initial placement of the needle. The location of the needle tip is then &quot;fine-tuned&quot; with small electrical pulses delivered through the block needle. The current required to elicit a motor response serves as a surrogate for the distance between the needle tip and the nerve; that is, less current is required as the needle is guided closer to the nerve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184103849\"><span class=\"h3\">Equipment for nerve stimulator guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many commercial peripheral nerve stimulators are available, which deliver an adjustable electrical current (0.0 to 2.0 mA for a duration of 0.3 seconds at a frequency of 2 Hz) to the tip of a hollow, insulated disposable needle (eg, Stimuplex, ProBloc). The needles have tubing that is attached to a syringe for aspiration and injection of local anesthetic; this allows the needle to be kept immobile while injecting or changing the syringe. A wire between the needle, the stimulator, and a grounding electrode on the patient, allows the electrical pulse to be transmitted to stimulate the nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97802\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97802 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184103855\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique for nerve stimulator guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After aseptic preparation of the site the stimulator needle is placed in the approximate vicinity of the nerve using anatomic landmarks. When the tip of the needle is near a motor nerve, a muscular response (a &quot;twitch&quot;) occurs in the distribution of the nerve. For most blocks, the initial electrical current is 1 mA. When a motor response occurs in the distribution of the desired nerve, the needle is shifted to maximize the motor response; this may involve advancing, withdrawing, or shifting the angle of the needle. When a maximal twitch response is found, the current is decreased by a small amount and the needle shifted as needed to again maximize the motor response; this procedure is repeated until there is a twitch at 0.5 mA, but the twitch is abolished if the current is reduced below 0.4 mA.</p><p>The local anesthetic is injected once the needle position has been optimized, a few milliliters at a time, aspirating to check for intravascular placement before administering the subsequent increment. Injection should be stopped immediately if the patient complains of severe pain (possible intraneural injection), or exhibits signs or symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity (possible intravascular injection). The needle should be repositioned (slight withdrawal may be sufficient) and symptoms resolved prior to resuming injection</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2370571049\"><span class=\"h3\">Stimulus threshold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts recommend obtaining a motor response with a current less than or equal to 0.5 mA prior to injection of local anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This places the needle at an optimal distance; when currents greater than this are needed, the block may have a lower success rate when stimulation persists at currents below 0.4 mA, the needle may be too close to the nerve with increased risk of intraneural injection. However, many factors can affect the relationship between the current that elicits a motor response and the distance between the needle tip and the nerve. Both ultrasound imaging and laboratory studies have shown that intraneural needle placement can occur at threshold currents &ge;0.5 mA, and the absence of a motor response does not exclude intraneural needle placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Diabetes mellitus and diabetic neuropathy may increase stimulation thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one study of popliteal sciatic nerve blocks in patients with and without diabetic neuropathy, stimulus thresholds for common peroneal nerve response were higher in patients with neuropathy, and 15 of 55 patients with neuropathy required a current &gt;0.5 mA to evoke a response despite ultrasound confirmed intraneural needle placement or needle-nerve contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Following location of the nerve by nerve stimulation or ultrasound guidance, a flexible catheter is placed alongside the nerve or plexus.</p><p>Continuous blockade can be used in either the hospital or ambulatory setting. A protocol to manage outpatient continuous nerve catheters should include: extensive preoperative oral and written instructions, contact with the patient on the first postoperative day, 24-hour anesthesiologist availability to manage questions or complications, and examination by a clinician (often the operating surgeon) within the first week following discharge. Under these conditions, the majority of patients are able to manage and remove their catheters at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Catheters are placed in a sterile fashion and generally may be left in place for up to seven days, but more typically, duration of use is limited by the volume of local anesthetic in the pump that is used after hospital discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354786799\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous kits available to place catheters. They usually contain a needle and catheter and may also have equipment to secure the catheter in place. Most kits use a catheter-through-needle technique, but catheter-over-needle products are also available. It is possible to use a standard epidural tray for continuous catheter techniques, when longer needles are needed and nerve stimulation is not planned. A sterile ultrasound probe cover is also necessary. Many choose to use a medical glue to affix catheters, as it may decrease leakage when catheter-through-needle techniques are employed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354786805\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous catheters may be placed using nerve stimulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasound techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>].

A sterile ultrasound probe cover is used to keep the probe from directly touching the sterile block area, and a sterile drape or towels are used to drape out the procedural area. Antibiotics used for a surgical procedure may be helpful to minimize catheter infection, but are not generally indicated when continuous nerve catheters are placed for nonsurgical pain control.</p><p>The nerve is located in the same manner as for a single-shot peripheral nerve block (using nerve stimulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasound guidance), followed by advancement of a flexible catheter (through or over the needle) adjacent to the nerve, and fixation of the catheter to the skin at the site of insertion.

The desired characteristics depend upon the circumstance: for example, motor blockade is desirable when a nerve block is used as the sole surgical anesthetic, but not when an outpatient is sent home with a block for analgesia; a long-acting local anesthetic is desirable for prolonged postoperative analgesia, but not when sensory examination is needed after the end of surgery. Local anesthetics with shorter duration of action (and generally quicker onset) include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a>; longer-acting local anesthetics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, levobupivacaine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>.</p><p>The concentration of local anesthetic determines the rate of diffusion into the nerve, with higher concentrations providing more rapid onset of nerve block.</p><p>More than one local anesthetic can be combined to decrease onset time while providing a longer duration of analgesia.

Slower absorption may decrease potential toxicity (in vascular areas) and prolong the duration of the block. Side effects include tachycardia and a potential for ischemia to nerves and other tissues from decreased blood flow seen in animal models; based on these effects it is reasonable to use the lower concentration (1:400,000) in patients at risk of cardiac ischemia or those with possibly decreased perineural blood flow (eg, post-chemotherapy, with diabetes or vascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> &ndash; Sodium bicarbonate is used to decrease onset time of the local anesthetic effect.

Although the definition of injury varies between studies, the incidence of persistent symptoms of nerve dysfunction may be as high as 8 to 10 percent in the days following the block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. The majority are transient, lasting days to months. Major complications resulting in permanent (greater than six months) nerve damage ranged between 0.015 and 0.09 percent in three registry studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

However, ultrasound images of intraneural injections without neurologic sequelae have refuted the previous belief that nerve damage is inevitable when local anesthetic (LA) is injected through the epineurium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. To minimize the incidence of intrafascicular injection, injection of anesthetic should be halted if the patient feels a paresthesia (shooting pain), or if the pressure required for injection is greater than usual; appropriate spread of the anesthetic should be observed when US guidance is used.</p><p>Additional risk factors for nerve injury remain uncertain, but may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexisting nerve pathology (including diabetes) may make a nerve more susceptible to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/2,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,75,76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of standard longer-beveled needles may increase likelihood of intrafascicular injection with clinical nerve injury compared with short-beveled &quot;block needles&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous visualization of the block needle using ultrasound is presumed to decrease the risk of intrafascicular injection, but a reduced risk of nerve injury has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p>Nerve injury can also occur as a direct effect of local anesthetic drugs.

Although there are no specific indications, they are often used to avoid general anesthesia and to minimize the use of opioids. (See <a href=\"#H184102361\" class=\"local\">'Use of nerve blocks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve blocks in deep anatomic locations (eg, plexus blocks, paravertebral blocks) and blocks near major blood vessels that are not easily compressed are generally avoided in patients with abnormal coagulation status. (See <a href=\"#H1787643\" class=\"local\">'Patients on antithrombotic medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral nerve block may be performed as a one-time administration of local anesthetic (single-injection) or an infusion of local anesthetic through a perineural catheter (continuous nerve block). (See <a href=\"#H184102483\" class=\"local\">'Types of nerve blocks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral nerves are located by direct visualization with ultrasound, by using motor responses to an electrical nerve stimulator, or both. We use ultrasound guidance rather than nerve stimulation for primary nerve localization for most peripheral nerve blocks. The use of ultrasound guidance generally improves the quality of the block, decreases placement time and time to onset, and decreases the volume of local anesthetic required; there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate any difference in neurologic complications with either technique. We suggest <strong>not</strong> deliberately eliciting paresthesias to localize nerves for peripheral nerve block (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H184102649\" class=\"local\">'Techniques of nerve location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous catheter techniques allow nerve blocks to be prolonged by intermittent injection, or continuous infusion. Continuous blockade can be used in either the in-patient or ambulatory setting. (See <a href=\"#H354786776\" class=\"local\">'Continuous catheter techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications that may occur with peripheral nerve blocks include nerve injury, hematoma, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, and secondary tissue injury. Infection and local anesthetic allergy are rare. Other complications may occur with specific blocks.
