Although the function of fibrocystin is unknown, it is found in the cortical and medullary collecting ducts and the thick ascending limb of the kidney, and in the epithelial cells of the hepatic bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Fibrocystin localizes to the primary cilia and basal body of the renal tubular cells. In the kidney collecting ducts, fibrocystin is expressed along with proteins associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD); however, fibrocystin does not share any homology with these [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This suggests that defects in fibrocystin disrupt normal functioning of renal cilia, pointing toward a shared pathogenesis of cyst formation in the two disorders (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and mechanisms of cyst growth&quot;</a>). Fibrocystin is also expressed in the liver, pancreas, and lungs.</p><p>The largest database for<em> PKHD1</em> mutations contains more than 750 different mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common, accounting for 20 percent of cases, is the missense mutation in exon 3, c.107C&gt;T.

Patients who survive the neonatal period most often have at least one missense mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/2,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,13</a>].</p><p/><p>However, a study of 73 patients with a wide range of clinical presentations reported that severity of <em>PKHD1</em> mutations did not predict kidney size or function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this cohort from 63 independent families, there were 28 patients (28 families) with either one truncating mutation or a combination of a truncating mutation and a missense mutation. The other 45 patients (38 families) had nontruncating variants. The frequency of truncating and missense variants was the same in patients who presented with more severe disease before 30 days of age (perinatal) compared with those with milder disease who presented after 30 days of age (nonperinatal). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, phenotypic variability occurs within a family with the same gene defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In one study, different phenotypic expression was seen in 11 of 20 affected families, including variability at the age of diagnosis and degree of liver and renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Recognition of this variability in disease expression is a potentially important consideration for parents with an affected fetus who are contemplating termination of the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two primary organ systems affected in ARPKD are the kidney and hepatobiliary tract. Other findings, such as those in the lungs and lower extremity deformities, are secondarily involved as a result of kidney <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88679753\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The kidneys are increased in size with microcysts (usually less than 2 mm in size), which radiate from the medulla to the cortex, and are visible as pinpoint dots on the capsular surface. Histologic examination reveals bilateral cystic dilatations of the collecting ducts, with flattening of the epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73986\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73986 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63180\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63180 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Microdissection studies and scanning electron microscopy show that there is no obstruction of the urinary flow in the dilated collecting ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The severity of the renal disease is proportional to the percentage of nephrons affected by cysts. Thus, in patients with milder disease, the ectasia of the collecting tubules is less prominent and irregularly distributed. Over time, larger renal cysts (up to 1 cm) and interstitial fibrosis develop, which contribute to the progressive deterioration of renal function seen in patients who survive beyond the neonatal period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88679760\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatobiliary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARPKD is always associated with biliary dysgenesis due to a developmental defect where a failure of ductal plate remodeling results in persistence of embryologic bile duct structures, which can become massively dilated. This leads to varying degrees of congenital hepatic fibrosis and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Histologic examination demonstrates ductal plate disruption with portal fibrosis surrounding increased numbers of hyperplastic, ectatic biliary ducts with normal liver parenchyma. Some patients may have macroscopic dilations of the intrahepatic bile ducts in addition to congenital fibrosis, a combination of findings referred to as Caroli syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The degree of liver involvement varies in ARPKD, but over time, hepatomegaly and portal hypertension develop in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caroli-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caroli disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical presentation of ARPKD varies based on the age of onset of symptoms and the predominance of hepatic or renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/14,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25-29</a>]. In one large case series from a single center that cared for patients between 1961 and 2004, approximately one-third of patients presented before 1 year of age, one-third between 1 and 20 years of age, and one-third after 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients who present during infancy were more likely to have severe renal disease and poor survival rate. Patients diagnosed as adolescents or adults typically present with symptoms related to congenital hepatic fibrosis (hepatomegaly, portal hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450214481\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARPKD is now often detected by routine antenatal ultrasonography in fetuses after 24 weeks of gestation. A presumptive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic findings of markedly enlarged echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. In some cases, discrete cysts ranging in size from 5 to 7 mm in diameter may be detected; however, larger cysts are unusual, especially those &gt;10 mm in diameter, and are more compatible with a diagnosis of multicystic dysplasia. These findings may be accompanied by oligohydramnios and the absence of urine in the fetal bladder.</p><p>However, a normal antenatal ultrasound does not exclude a diagnosis of ARPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, other hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (eg, autosomal dominant polycystic disease [ADPKD] and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta [HNF1B]-related cystic kidney disease) or syndromic ciliopathies such as Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndromes may have similar ultrasound findings. Exclusion of other system involvement such as polydactyly or cerebellar vermis hypoplasia improves diagnostic accuracy. Ultrasounds of both parents should be performed to see if there is any evidence of ADPKD or HNF1B-related cystic kidney disease, both of which are autosomal dominant disorders. In addition, prenatal genetic testing may be helpful in differentiating ARPKD from other diagnoses. As noted above, it is challenging to correlate phenotype with a specific genotype and caution should be exercised in making any management decision based on prenatal genetic test results.

In addition, other factors that negatively affect pulmonary function include limited diaphragmatic excursion caused by hypoventilation due to the massively enlarged kidneys, and pneumothoraces, a relatively common complication. Large case series report approximately 40 percent of patients were supported by mechanical ventilation, and 30 percent died primarily from insufficient pulmonary function, as the degree of pulmonary involvement was incompatible with life even with mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/9,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33</a>].</p><p>In infants with severe disease, oligohydramnios is a common finding during pregnancy.

For neonates with ESRD, dialysis is the only RRT option and needs to be performed in a tertiary center with pediatric expertise in the care of neonates with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have been performed in neonates with ARPKD, and the choice is dependent on the experience and availability at each center. If peritoneal dialysis is performed, unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy may be needed to accommodate the volume of peritoneal dialysate fluid required for dialysis. However, despite the advances in the medical management of infants with ESRD, chronic dialysis started during the first month of life is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1054191294\"><span class=\"h2\">Infancy and childhood management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of patients who survive the neonatal period focuses on the care of renal and hepatic complications, including ongoing surveillance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1054191321\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because ARPKD is a progressive disease, the following should be monitored on a regular basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure measurement &ndash; The frequency of evaluation varies depending upon the degree of renal impairment and whether the patient is hypertensive.
