The discussion includes the common features underlying all of these disorders, the criteria for recognizing human disease, and the major new approaches to improve their treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmunity is an immune response directed against an antigen within the body of the host. The definition does not distinguish whether the response is induced by a foreign or autochthonous antigen. It usually involves both T-cell and B-cell responses. It only requires that the adaptive immune response be directed to a self-antigen.</p><p>Autoimmune disease is a pathologic condition caused by the adaptive autoimmune response. However, these definitions can be unclear since it is frequently difficult to assign causality when dealing with a human disease. It is useful, therefore, to consider the evidence of an autoimmune etiology of a human disease with three degrees of stringency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct evidence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect evidence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumstantial evidence</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The demonstration of autoantibodies is usually the first step in the diagnosis of these diseases, although the antibodies may not be the actual pathogens of the disorder. Naturally occurring autoantibodies are common in all immunologically competent people and may rise nonspecifically during the course of infection, disease or injury. Thus, the mere presence of autoantibodies does not necessarily establish a cause-and-effect relationship, since the autoantibodies may be the result, not the cause, of the disease process. Yet, the presence of autoantibody responses has great value in diagnosing and prognosing many human diseases.</p><p>Autoantibodies may be present many years before the diagnosis of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Combined with genetic information or family history, the presence of autoantibodies may be highly predictive of the later onset of an autoimmune disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct evidence implies that an autoimmune response causes disease. This usually involves reproducing the disease, totally or in part, by transfer of autoantibody from a patient to a healthy recipient, either another human or an animal.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One striking example of antibody transfer is the reproduction of pemphigus by injection of patient serum into a neonatal mouse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This procedure reproduces the essential pathologic features of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human-to-human transfer of autoantibody may result from transplacental transmission of the disease. Examples of maternal-fetal transmission have been well-documented in cases of Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the complete heart block and other cardiac abnormalities in neonatal lupus associated with maternal lupus and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most of the clinical manifestations in the offspring are temporary, because the autoantibody in these cases is provided through passive transfer of serum from the mother. An exception is the congenital heart block and other cardiac abnormalities of neonatal lupus, which are persistent and potentially life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-lupus-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There are situations in which the pathologic effects of antibody can be reproduced in vitro. Examples are diseases of the blood, such as hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Cold agglutinin disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs&quot;</a>). Antiphospholipid antibodies, another example, are autoantibodies that may affect blood clotting in laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H172884294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Patients on an anticoagulant'</a>.)</p><p>An important void in our studies of autoimmune disease is the lack of routine methods that directly show the pathogenic effects of T cells. Many attempts have, therefore, been made to adopt immunodeficient mice as &ldquo;living test tubes&rdquo; for the demonstration of autoimmune-induced pathology.</p><p>Experiments showing the effects of cytotoxic lymphocytes against human tissue cells in the test tube require that the cells be cultured in vitro without changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second level of proof of causality relies upon indirect evidence. In human autoimmune disease, this requires the availability of an appropriate animal model in which the necessary transfer studies can be carried out to prove a cause and effect relationship. Different animal models are utilized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reproduction of disease in animals via immunization with the appropriate antigen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naturally occurring disease in animals that resembles its human counterpart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease resulting from manipulation of the immune system</p><p/><p>A good example of an experimental model is autoimmune thyroiditis in the mouse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Here, the experimental antigen, thyroglobulin, is a major target of autoantibody production in patients. In genetically susceptible strains of mice, immunization with thyroglobulin produces a pathological picture of chronic thyroiditis that closely resembles the human disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a>). Another useful example is myocarditis, which can be reproduced by immunization of susceptible mice with murine myosin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most widely-studied model of autoimmune disease is experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The demyelinating changes in the experimental disease bear many similarities to multiple sclerosis in humans. Three antigens can induce this disease in rodents: myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The last produces axonal loss as well as demyelination and has a relapsing and remitting course similar to multiple sclerosis in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Manipulation of components of the immune system, such as the introduction of a T cell receptor for a disease-producing antigen into an otherwise disease resistant strain, has suggested that activation of antigen presenting dendritic cells is a first step in inducing autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These animal models are valuable for studying pathogenesis but may not be useful indicators of etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Naturally occurring disease in animals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another type of disease model is derived from a naturally occurring disease in animals that resembles its human counterpart. For example, at least three diseases occur in particular genetic strains of mice that resemble many aspects of human SLE. They include the <span class=\"nowrap\">NZB/NZW</span> hybrid, <span class=\"nowrap\">MRL/lpr,</span> and BXSB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Many autoantibodies typical of lupus are found in these animals, and cell transfer experiments clearly establish these diseases as autoimmune in origin. However, it is not apparent what serves as the primary antigen for inducing the disease in these animals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another important spontaneous model is the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, which develops a disease closely resembling type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These mice have been particularly useful for delineating the major genetic traits that increase susceptibility to the disease, some of which also appear to operate in human type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune system manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A third type of model is derived from experiments that manipulate the immune system of experimental animals, particularly mice. Models of inflammatory bowel disease have been described in animals in which particular cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10 have been eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Mice deficient in programmed cell death-1 (PD-) immuno-inhibitory coreceptor develop autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy with production of high titers of autoantibodies against cardiac troponin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These knockout models teach us the importance of immunological homeostasis in preventing autoimmune disease.</p><p>The most important genetic trait in determining susceptibility to autoimmune disease is the human major histocompatibility complex HLA. Replacing the MHC of a mouse with a human susceptibility HLA haplotype can render the mouse susceptible to many experimentally induced autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Moreover, simply inserting the susceptible HLA haplotype can sometimes induce spontaneous myocarditis in previously resistant mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Circumstantial evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lowest level of proof, circumstantial evidence, attributes an enigmatic human disease to autoimmunity. The first piece of suggestive evidence is the presence of autoantibodies.</p><p>The hazards of using this kind of evidence as the basis for concluding that a disease is caused by autoimmunity have been previously described. Natural autoantibodies are very common and may even rise nonspecifically during the course of a disease process.</p><p>A second kind of circumstantial evidence comes from the finding that autoimmune diseases tend to cluster, probably because they share some genetic susceptibility traits. As examples, a single individual will have more than one autoimmune disease, and members of the family share the same or even other autoimmune diseases. The association of one disease of unclear etiology with another of authentic autoimmune etiology strengthens the possibility that the former is also an autoimmune disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>The best-studied autoimmune diseases show a particular bias to certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, usually the Class II category. Since the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are critical in antigen presentation and disease induction, they are usually most critical in initiating a particular autoimmune response. Next, a large number of regulatory genes contribute to normal immunologic homeostasis. Allelic differences in these genes<strong> </strong>may contribute to greater or lesser susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases. They include such regulatory<strong> </strong>genes as <em>CTLA4</em> and <em>PTPN22</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Yet, in the aggregate, all of these heritable traits, MHC class II and regulatory genes, contribute less than half of the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, even in genetically identical twins. Therefore, the majority of patients with an autoimmune disease present without a clear family history. In part, this paradox underlines the role of environmental factors. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Inductive mechanisms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenetic mechanisms'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, post-genomic epigenetic effects are responsible for incomplete concordance of monozygotic twins. Epigenetic changes in gene expression occur by mechanisms other than alterations in the DNA sequence. They include such mechanisms as methylation of DNA nucleotides and histone post-translational modifications affecting chromatin structure. These and many other epigenetic markers account for the fact that even monozygotic twins do not have identical immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, most but not all autoimmune diseases are more common in women than men. A sex bias, therefore, provides increased circumstantial evidence of an autoimmune etiology. The sex-based differences in autoimmune diseases have provided new information on the important role of<strong> </strong>sex hormones in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29,30</a>].</p><p>Finally, the response of a disease to immunosuppressive treatment is often an initial clinical indicator of a possible autoimmune etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTIVE MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of autoimmunity is the defining characteristic of an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune response can be initiated by autologous or foreign antigens. Like all immune responses, autoimmunity is under strict genetic control of antigen recognition, cellular interactions, and eventual outcomes. In addition, non-genetic environmental agents may promote autoimmune responses. Infections, for example, can provide the requisite antigen by mimicking or altering of self-antigens or by causing antigen &ldquo;spillage&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The microorganisms that generally inhabit body surfaces including the skin and mucus membranes also influence both the initiation and progression of an autoimmune response. In individuals, populations of commensal microorganisms (&ldquo;microbiota&rdquo;) can profoundly affect the induction of such diseases as inflammatory bowel diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, infection can provide the inflammatory context that favors immune responses, activating through the innate immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, renewed attention has focused on Epstein-Barr virus as an instigating agent in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENETIC MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite their diverse etiology, certain pathogenetic mechanisms are common to all autoimmune diseases. With few exceptions, they require the presence of self-reactive CD4-positive T lymphocytes. Diseases in which there is a chronic inflammatory response but no evidence of adaptive immunity in the form of self-reactive T cells are now referred to as autoinflammatory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Previously, self-reactive T-cells were believed to be deleted in the thymus and to be present only when they arise following somatic mutation, producing &ldquo;forbidden clones.&rdquo; The observation that autoimmune responses are not mono- or pauciclonal has demolished the original forbidden clone theory, but there are some striking examples in B cells of isotype (ie, immunoglobulin class or subclass) restriction that are still unexplained but may be related to receptor history (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Autoantibodies in the IgG4 subclass are prominent in a number of <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/infiltrative</span> diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Thymic selection is critical for normal T-cell development and is dependent upon interaction with thymic stromal cells. The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene is an autosomal recessive gene that is responsible for intrathymic presentation of a number of autologous antigens. Mutations in AIRE gene cause several combinations of autoimmune endocrine diseases, such as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), because the appropriate self-antigens are not properly presented in the thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis#H571998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features of AIRE deficiency/APECED'</a>.)</p><p>Although there is experimental evidence that deletion of self-reactive lymphocytes occurs in the thymus, this mechanism seems to be totally effective only for the most prominent systemically expressed antigens, such as those of the major blood groups and histocompatibility complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. By comparison, in the case of most other self-antigens, deletion of self-reactive T cells in the thymus is either lacking or incomplete. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in the periphery that retard the activation of those self-reactive T cells that escape deletion in the thymus.</p><p>One well-studied mechanism is clonal anergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This term describes the unresponsive state of T cells that have encountered their specific antigen without costimulatory signals. Such cells may remain unresponsive for long periods of time. There is a risk that anergy can be terminated by an encounter with appropriate, nonspecific, costimulatory signals from injured tissue.</p><p>Another mechanism of peripheral self-tolerance involves immunological ignorance, that is, the lack of a productive encounter between the T cell and its corresponding <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/major</span> histocompatibility complex (MHC) complex on an antigen-presenting cell. Ignorance can be overcome by changes in antigen availability, such as presentation by an infecting microorganism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These events can cause autoimmunity and can possibly give rise to autoimmune disease.</p><p>A novel possibility is that autoimmunity may be triggered by the production of antibodies directed against peptides translated by anti-sense strand DNA, in which the sense strand translates an auto-antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These antibodies, in turn, induce anti-idiotypic antibodies that may cross-react with the autoantigen.</p><p>Finally, the autoimmune response is kept in check by active regulation, although eliminating regulatory cells generally cannot initiate autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Among the major regulatory cells are a subset of T cells bearing the markers CD4, CD25, and forkhead box protein P3 (Fox P3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Two different subpopulations of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) can be distinguished. Naturally recurring Tregs exert their suppressive effects by cell-to-cell contact of membrane-bound molecules, such as CTLA-4. Induced Tregs, in contrast, are cell-contact-independent and operate mainly through soluble suppressive cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Treg function and phenotype exhibit some plasticity, and cells with diminished suppressive capacity may be seen in some autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. A specialized population of T cells that also express the natural killer (NK) receptor (called NK-T cells) can also regulate autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/43,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48</a>].</p><p>Central tolerance is induced in B cells as well as T cells but, in general, is less efficient. Natural autoantibodies are a normal component of the innate immune response. Because of their cross-reactions and connectivity, they form a network that may be important in an initial protective immunity. The mechanism of central tolerance, important mainly in B cells, is receptor-editing. It limits the random process of variable gene recombination during B cell development to exclude autoreactive B cell receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>A heritable defect in the suppressive effects of CD4+ CD25+ Fox P3 regulatory T cells appears to be the mechanism underlying the rare lethal autoimmune human disease &ldquo;immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked&rdquo; (IPEX syndrome, MIM 304790). Mutations in the forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) located on the X chromosome have been noted in most of the affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a mouse model, deficiency of FOXP3 results in an absence of CD4+ CD25+ T cells. In humans with IPEX, the number of regulatory T cells appears to be normal, but their ability to suppress autologous effector T cells is markedly impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IPEX: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether autoimmune disease will follow an autoimmune response depends upon both the quality of the immune response and the availability of the corresponding antigen. Antigens on the surface of circulating cells such as blood cells are readily available to circulating antibody, and therefore such cells may be damaged or eliminated by autoantibody acting with complement, killer T cells, or phagocytes. The receptors on cell surfaces such as the TSH receptor on the thyroid cell or on the acetylcholine receptor at neuromuscular junctions may also be directly attacked by autoantibody. This interaction may result in stimulating the receptor in Graves' disease or in blocking the neuromuscular transmission as observed in myasthenia gravis.</p><p>In other diseases, autoantibodies are produced to particular enzymes. As an example, antibodies to the P450 enzymes are prominent in autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis (previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. These enzymes are widely distributed in the body, and the question arises of why the diseases are organ-specific. Evidence suggests that the enzymes are accessible to antibodies or T cells primarily in reactivated locations.</p><p>Many other autoimmune diseases are not due to the direct effects of autoantibody. Rather, they are associated with T-cell-mediated immune responses. Sometimes, cytotoxic T cells may be generated that can damage their respective target cell. In other cases, cytokines are produced that are harmful to surrounding tissue cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Finally, T cells may activate macrophages, which can produce a great deal of tissue injury through their soluble products, including cytokines and reactive oxygen intermediates. A functionally significant polymorphism of a lymphocyte specific phosphatase known as the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 gene (PTPN22) has been linked to T cell hyperresponsiveness. Carriage of the 1858T variant of PTPN22 is associated with several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves' disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>High-throughput genetic and genomic studies have also focused attention on innate mechanisms in autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The innate immune system uses sets of molecules known as pattern-recognition receptors that have been selected through evolution to recognize molecular patterns found in microorganisms. Families of pattern-recognition receptors include the Toll-like receptors, the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, and the NACHT leucine-rich-repeat proteins (NALPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both NALP1 and NALP3 comprise part of cytoplasmic complexes called inflammasomes that regulate the activation of caspase 1, which converts interleukins into their active forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Variants of NALP1 are associated with autoimmune disorders that cluster with vitiligo (eg, autoimmune thyroid disease, latent autoimmune diabetes mellitus in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, pernicious anemia, and Addison's disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Mutant NALP3, also known as cryopyrin, is linked to three inflammatory disorders associated with autosomal dominant inheritance: the familial cold urticaria syndrome, the Muckle-Wells syndrome, and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In human disease, it is frequently impossible to clearly separate the injury that is due to antibody-mediated from cell-mediated reactions. In general, however, the cell-mediated responses are associated with the Th1 subset of CD4+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Antibody-mediated mechanisms in general associate with Th2 responses. Thus, sometimes an autoimmune disorder can benefit by a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 response. This approach is one of several new concepts for therapy.</p><p>This original simplistic view of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> dichotomy is not easily applied to human disease in which both Th1 and Th2 responses are generally evident. In fact, some autoimmune diseases are actually down-regulated by administering interferon-gamma (IFN-g), the prototypic Th1 cytokine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. It is now evident that a third T cell subset producing IL-17 (termed Th17) plays a critical role in several autoimmune conditions. Interestingly, there is a reciprocal relationship between Th17 and Treg that may dictate the final outcome of an autoimmune reaction. Inflammatory cytokines TGF-g and IFN-g play central roles in setting the balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189998077\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOINFLAMMATORY DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;autoinflammatory syndrome&rdquo; refers to a group of autosomal predominant inherited disorders that resemble in many respects traditional autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. They are distinguished by the absence of a defined adaptive immune response. The prototypic disorders were in a group of &ldquo;hereditary periodic fever syndromes&rdquo; that shared a common involvement of certain specific cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Study of these disorders revealed a prominent role for the innate immune system. The category of autoinflammatory diseases has gradually expanded to include a group of disorders sharing an abnormally increased inflammatory response mediated predominantly by cells and molecules of the innate immune system with a significant host predisposition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1450730\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns have been raised, particularly in the lay press, regarding the risk of inducing autoimmune disease by vaccination in patients with autoimmune disorders; the scientific evidence clearly favors the value of vaccination. Patients suffering from an autoimmune disease might have a generally heightened susceptibility to autoimmunity, but there are no well-designed epidemiologic studies showing a significant increase in any autoimmune disease following vaccination of these patients. Other studies indicate there is no difference in the occurrence following vaccination of severe systemic adverse effects, including autoimmune disorders, with vaccines using adjuvant compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines. Indeed, many patients with autoimmune disease are relatively poor immune responders to vaccine antigens and may require additional boosters. The protective value of vaccines in patients with autoimmune disease is well-established based by sound epidemiologic data, while the possibility that vaccines may induce or exacerbate autoimmune disease remains speculative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3519079\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune disease is a pathologic condition caused by an adaptive autoimmune response, an immune response directed against an antigen within the body of the host, termed a self-antigen. The response may be induced by a foreign or self-antigen. It usually involves a T-cell and B-cell response. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The demonstration of autoantibodies is usually the first step in the diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, although it is not sufficient. The antibodies may not be the actual pathogens. Naturally occurring autoantibodies are common in all immunologically competent people and may even rise nonspecifically during the course of disease or injury. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Direct evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct evidence of causality, the most stringent level of evidence for autoimmunity, implies that an autoimmune response can be shown to produce the disease. This usually involves transfer of autoantibody from a patient to a healthy recipient, either another human or an animal. Additionally, there are situations in which the pathologic effects of antibody can be reproduced in vitro. An important void in our studies of human autoimmune disease is the lack of methods that directly show the pathogenic effects of T cells by adoptive transfer. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Direct evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second level of proof of causality relies upon indirect evidence. In human autoimmune disease, this requires the availability of an appropriate animal model in which the necessary transfer studies can be carried out. Different animal models are utilized, including reproduction of disease in animals via immunization with the appropriate antigen, naturally occurring disease in animals that resembles its human counterpart, and disease resulting from manipulation of the immune system. The most important genetic trait in determining susceptibility to autoimmune disease is the human major histocompatibility complex, HLA. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for autoimmune disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Naturally occurring disease in animals'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Immune system manipulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lowest level of proof, circumstantial evidence, is the one most commonly available to attribute an enigmatic human disease to autoimmunity. Such evidence may include autoantibodies, clustering of diseases within an individual or family, bias to certain HLA haplotypes, a sex bias, and a response to immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Circumstantial evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An autoimmune response can be initiated by autologous or foreign antigens. Like all immune responses, autoimmunity is under strict genetic control of antigen recognition, cellular interactions, and eventual outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Inductive mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of autoimmune disease depends upon an imbalance between pathogenic factors generated by autoreactive T cells and B cells and the regulatory factors that normally control the immune response. For example, the balance of activities between various effector T cells (Teff) and regulatory T cells (Treg) helps to determine whether an individual maintains normal self-tolerance or progresses to autoimmune disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenetic mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases in which there is chronic inflammation but no evidence of autoreactive T cells or B cells, termed autoinflammatory diseases, are associated with the innate immune response. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenetic mechanisms'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-autoimmunity/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rose NR.
