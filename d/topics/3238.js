Scheduling the consultation in the early to mid third trimester is prudent in case of preterm delivery. Preoperative history, physical examination, and selective testing can identify patients with comorbidities, such as a difficult airway or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), that increase their risk of complications during and following surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preanesthesia-medical-evaluation-of-the-obese-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preanesthesia medical evaluation of the obese patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preoperative testing should be guided by patient-specific risk factors. Some clinicians choose to crossmatch these patients rather than order a type and screen, or they hold a clot in case crossmatch is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most cost-effective approach is unclear, as high-quality data are not available.</p><p>It is also unclear whether an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed routinely. The American Heart Association (AHA) 2009 scientific advisory on cardiovascular evaluation and management of severely obese patients (body mass index [BMI] &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> undergoing surgery states that a 12 lead ECG is reasonable in those with at least one risk factor for perioperative cardiovascular morbidity (coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine levels &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or poor exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, cardiac changes (ventricular hypertrophy, systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation) can occur in the absence of these risk factors in patients with longstanding severe obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Clinical questionnaires or prediction scores can be used for screening. The STOP-BANG questionnaire is practical and is a cost-effective approach to identify patients with OSA before general surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87572 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95317\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95317 \">figure 1</a>). It assesses Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, and high blood Pressure (STOP), as well as BMI, age, neck circumference, and gender (BANG). Preoperative identification of OSA helps in planning interventions to reduce respiratory morbidity, which can be aggravated by immobility, positioning, pain, and use of opioids.

However, evidence for optimum dosing in the obese patient population is limited. Standard doses of antimicrobial agents, particularly the cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], result in low serum and tissue levels in obese patients (&ge;20 percent of obese women did not achieve minimal inhibitory concentrations for Gram-negative rods in incisional adipose samples with a 2 g dose in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]); therefore, higher doses of the prophylactic antimicrobial agent should be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

They also suggest consideration of additional intraoperative doses in patients with excessive blood loss or extended surgery (duration exceeding two half-lives of the drug), which is the standard of care in other surgeries. </p><p>For women with a history of serious penicillin allergy (immediate hypersensitivity reaction), combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> 900 mg plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> based on dosing weight intravenously provides broad coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Gentamicin dosing is based on the patient&rsquo;s actual body weight; however, if the patient&rsquo;s actual weight is more than 20 percent above ideal body weight (IBW), the dosing weight (DW) is determined as follows: DW = IBW+ 0.4(actual weight - IBW) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Emerging data support use of extended-spectrum antibiotic combinations for women at high risk of postcesarean infection, but this has not become a standard of care, in part because of concerns about inducing antibiotic resistance.

A hydraulic or ceiling lift or an air transfer system (eg, HoverMatt) can be useful to lift and move the patient. Special operating tables may be needed. For example, a standard operating table has a weight capacity up to 500 pounds (227 kg), while a bariatric surgical table has a weight capacity up to 1000 pounds (454 kg). </p><p>Patient positioning is important to limit unfavorable physiological sequelae (eg, supine hypotension, respiratory dysfunction), provide optimum exposure for surgical procedures, and reduce the risk of perioperative nerve, joint, and soft tissue injury. Pressure points (including buttocks, lumbar region and shoulders) should be well-padded to prevent skeletal muscle necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Given the increased potential for supine hypotension during surgery from the combined effects of the panniculus, gravid uterus, and regional anesthesia, we suggest tilting the operating table at least 15 degrees to the left or using a firm right lumbar wedge of sufficient height to achieve at least 15 degrees of tilt. A 2010 systematic review of randomized trials did not demonstrate a clear maternal or fetal benefit from use of these maneuvers, possibly because of small sample size, inadequate tilt, or a heterogenous patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Blood pressure should be monitored with an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff. A thigh cuff is advised if the arm circumference is 45 to 52 cm and a large adult cuff if arm circumference is 35 to 44 cm.

In women with an apron-like panniculus, the umbilicus is a poor landmark for identifying pelvic organs because it is displaced caudally from its normal location at about the level of the iliac crest.

Neuraxial opioids are preferred over parenteral opioids because they minimize the risk of respiratory depression and provide better analgesia. Patient-controlled analgesia is an option in cases where a general anesthetic was used for the operative procedure. Neuraxial administration does not eliminate the risk of respiratory depression, which has been reported in severely obese women who received intrathecal opioids for postcesarean analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. When opioids are administered postoperatively, patients should be closely monitored with continuous pulse oximetry (eg, hourly in the first 24 hours and every two hours in the second 24 hours after cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]).
