At this time, measurement of FFR of one or more stenoses may guide decision-making regarding additional PCI.

This usually occurs at the site of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque; thrombus formation usually leads to complete cessation of antegrade flow. The presence of thrombus often allows for identification of the culprit lesion as thrombus has easily identified angiographic characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In addition to a culprit lesion, 40 to 60 percent of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients have multivessel coronary artery disease with other significant lesions (&ge;50 percent luminal narrowing at the time of angiography or fractional flow reserve &lt;0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

In a study of 2082 patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, the one-year cumulative incidence of death for patients with single-, double-, and triple-vessel disease was 3.2, 4.4, and 7.8 percent (p = 0.003), and of target vessel revascularization was 11.3, 15.2, and 16.2 percent (p = 0.02), respectively. The adverse impact of multivessel disease due to non-culprit lesions raises the question as to whether revascularization of these non-culprit lesions will improve outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470454991\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACHES TO NON-CULPRIT LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the evidence provided below supports our recommendation to perform fractional flow reserve (FFR) guided non-culprit percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; prior to discharge from the index hospitalization) to lower the rate of subsequent revascularization. Our approach to non-culprit PCI is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H625058030\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p>There are four principal strategies to manage non-culprit lesions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refer for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) after the patient has recovered from the acute STEMI. After primary PCI, there will be some patients who have a relatively clear indication for CABG. For example, a patient with a right coronary artery STEMI who is found to have a significant left main stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of left main coronary artery disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No further revascularization, unless standard indications for revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease are met.

However, when patients who were treated with staged PCI during the hospitalization were analyzed separately, short- and long-term outcomes favored multivessel revascularization compared with culprit only strategy. </p><p>Nine published randomized trials of patients with multivessel disease, with DANAMI-3&mdash;PRIMULTI, PRAMI, CvLPRIT, and Compare Acute being the four largest, have compared culprit only with complete revascularization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DANAMI-3&mdash;PRIMULTI randomly assigned 313 patients with one or more clinically significantly coronary stenoses in addition to the culprit lesion to either no further invasive treatment or complete, FFR-guided revascularization before discharge, usually two days after initial PCI. The primary composite end point (all-cause mortality, non-fatal infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization of lesions in non-infarct related arteries) occurred less often in the group with complete revascularization (13 versus 22 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.83). The benefit was almost entirely attributable to a lower rate of subsequent revascularization of non-infarct related arteries (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18-0.53). Approximately one-third of patients who were assigned to the complete revascularization strategy did not undergo non-culprit PCI, as FFR values were above the discrimination value of 0.80 despite the fact that initial angiography suggested high-grade stenoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;, section on 'Intermediate severity stenosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PRAMI trial planned to randomly assign 600 patients to either preventive or no preventive PCI after successful primary PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Preventive PCI was defined as immediate (same-setting) PCI of non-infarct arteries with &gt;50 percent diameter stenosis (staged procedures were discouraged). FFR assessment was not used. Patients with cardiogenic shock or prior CABG were excluded. The trial was terminated early by the data and safety monitoring committee after the enrollment of 465 patients for the finding of a highly significant between-group difference in the incidence of the primary outcome (a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal MI, or refractory angina) favoring non-culprit PCI (9 versus 23 percent; HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.58) during a mean follow-up of 23 months. There were a total of 21 and 53 events in the two groups, respectively, of which about half were due to refractory angina. The HRs for the individual components of the composite end point all favored non-culprit PCI. However, we believe there are limitations to PRAMI, including stopping early, liberal definition of multivessel disease, and a small number of events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CvLPRIT trial randomly assigned 296 patients to complete revascularization during the hospitalization or infarct-related, artery-only revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Multivessel disease was defined as one or more non-culprit stenosis of &gt;70 percent diameter stenosis in other coronary arteries. Among those assigned to treatment prior to discharge, 64 percent received complete revascularization at the time of primary PCI. FFR assessment was not used. The primary composite end point (all-cause death, recurrent MI, heart failure, and ischemia -driven revascularization at 12 months) occurred less often in the complete revascularization group (10.0 versus 21.2 percent; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.84). All components of the primary end point were lower with complete revascularization and there was no difference in the safety end points (major bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, or stroke).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Compare-Acute trial randomly assigned 885 patients in a 1:2 ratio to undergo complete revascularization of non-infarct related coronary arteries or no revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. FFR was performed in both groups and, in the revascularization group, PCI was performed in all lesions with a result &le;0.80. In most cases, revascularization took place during the index procedure. The primary composite end point of death from any cause, nonfatal MI, revascularization, and cerebrovascular events at 12 months occurred less often in the complete revascularization group (7.8 versus 20.5 percent; hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.22-0.55). This outcome was driven principally by many fewer revascularizations being performed in the complete revascularization group (18 versus 103). In addition, there was a trend toward a lower rate of MI (2.4 versus 4.7 percent) with complete revascularization. </p><p/><p>A 2017 network meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials with 2285 patients compared four revascularization strategies in STEMI patients with multivessel disease at the time of primary PCI: complete revascularization at the index procedure; complete revascularization as a staged procedure, with the non-culprit vessel(s) being treated prior to discharge; complete revascularization as a staged procedure in which the non-culprit vessel(s) was treated within a few weeks after discharge (not symptom driven); and culprit only PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This meta-analysis was published before Compare-Acute. The following findings were noted at a median follow-up of 25 months:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete revascularization, either at the index procedure or as a staged procedure, compared with culprit only PCI, was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events (risk ratio [RR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.77). Most studies used a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, and ischemia driven revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The composite primary end point (major adverse cardiovascular events) was driven principally by a lower rate of urgent revascularization (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.66).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were trends toward lower risks of all-cause mortality and recurrent MI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52-1.12 and 0.55, 95% CI 0.23-1.28, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010829\"><span class=\"h1\">UNANSWERED QUESTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although we recommend performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of significant non-culprit lesions prior to hospital discharge in most patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), there are aspects of clinical care for which the optimal approach is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625057993\"><span class=\"h2\">What is the optimal timing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who will undergo PCI of non-culprit lesions, the optimal timing is not known. One small trial suggested that there was no difference in major cardiovascular outcomes between PCI of non-culprit lesions at the time of primary PCI or staged (deferred but during hospitalization) revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Factors to consider for performing non-culprit PCI at the time of primary PCI include patient stability, ability to accurately assess lesion significance in the setting of acute coronary syndromes, likelihood of procedural success, risk of the intervention (eg, possibility of increased risk of contrast nephropathy), and the potential benefit of revascularization (eg, size of the ischemic territory). Nonetheless, we generally bring the patient back to the catheterization laboratory prior to hospital discharge rather than perform non-culprit PCI at the time of primary PCI. Until a well-conducted, large randomized trial addresses this question, either approach is reasonable. </p><p>Angiographic stenosis severity may be overestimated during angiography at the time of STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Assessment of fractional flow reserve of some of these lesions is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010869\"><span class=\"h2\">Which non-culprit lesions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-culprit lesions should be treated during the initial hospitalization if angiographic or intracoronary imaging suggests unstable morphology (ulceration, thrombus) or in patients with recurrent ischemic symptoms. In the absence of unprovoked ischemia, PCI of non-culprit lesions should be treated soon after PCI if the stenosis severity is &gt;70 percent, or &gt;50 percent with an abnormal fractional flow reserve (FFR), and the location of the lesion is proximal or in a vessel that subtends a significant area of myocardium. If the burden of ischemia is unclear or the viability of the territory is in question, further assessment with noninvasive imaging prior to PCI can be considered. Vessels not suitable for stenting, due to small diameter or distal location, should not be treated routinely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010836\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic total occlusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to STEMI patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO) of a non-culprit lesion, identified at the time of primary PCI, is not known. We perform PCI of non-culprit CTO in STEMI patients if the occluded vessel subtends a significant area of potentially viable myocardium and the anatomic complexity predicts a high likelihood of success with an antegrade approach or the procedure can be performed by an operator proficient in more advanced chronic total occlusion techniques, including re-entry and retrograde approaches, such that the risks of the procedure are low. In general, we stage the CTO intervention rather than perform during the index primary PCI. Timing can be prior to discharge or electively after discharge, depending on the severity of symptoms and objective evidence of ischemic burden. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of intracoronary stents for specific coronary lesions&quot;, section on 'Chronic total occlusion'</a>.)</p><p><br/>Up to 15 percent of patients with STEMI are found to have CTO of a non-culprit artery at coronary angiography. The presence of an occlusion of another epicardial artery significantly increases mortality and this is particularly true if CTO is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Observational studies have suggested that PCI of CTO improves outcomes, particularly in patients with STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The EXPLORE trial randomly assigned 204 STEMI patients to PCI of CTO within seven days of primary PCI or no PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At four months, there was no difference in the primary end points of the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (44.1 versus 44.8 percent) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (215.6 versus 212.8 mL), both assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Core laboratory adjudicated procedural success was 73 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13011071\"><span class=\"h2\">Who should receive FFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform measurement of FFR for non-culprit lesions of intermediate or indeterminate severity seen at the time of angiography.
