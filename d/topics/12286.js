Furthermore, three of the top five fastest growing sports have a high risk for acute injury to the wrist (rugby, lacrosse, and field hockey) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Causes of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents will be presented here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57608\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57608 \">table 1</a>).

In such patients, the growing bones are more susceptible to stress than are the surrounding ligaments and joint capsules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Physeal (growth plate)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal radius</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the distal radius are the most common fracture in children and adolescents, accounting for 35 to 47 percent of wrist fractures. Distal radius fractures occur most frequently during early adolescence; children with increased body mass and decreased bone mineral density are at increased risk. The mechanism of injury is usually a fall on a hyperextended wrist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H2133694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H729812\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>Fractures of the distal radius usually involve the metaphysis. Although physeal (growth plate) injuries are relatively rare, they must be considered carefully because they can result in premature growth arrest. Shortening of the radius can lead to ulnar impaction and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic wrist pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Ulnar impaction'</a> and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'TFCC injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical findings of distal radius fractures include point tenderness, swelling, ecchymosis, and decreased grip strength. Associated injuries may include distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries and TFCC tears. Fractures of the radial shaft with associated dislocation of the DRUJ are known as Galeazzi fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H2136323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'DRUJ and TFCC injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of a distal radius fracture is confirmed by plain radiographs with the exception of children with nondisplaced Salter-Harris I injuries. Radiographic assessment, classification, and physical examination of these injuries are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H730609\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H2133715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Metaphyseal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common types of distal radial metaphyseal fractures are torus fractures and greenstick fractures. Torus fractures (also known as buckle fractures) are caused by compressive forces that lead to buckling or plastic deformation of a single cortex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71495 \">image 1</a>). Greenstick fractures are incomplete fractures in which one cortex breaks completely while the cortex on the opposite side undergoes plastic deformation; associated angulation or rotation are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59653\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59653 \">image 2</a>). Recognition and treatment of these fractures are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H730609\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Definitive care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Physeal fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal radial physeal injuries must be carefully considered in children with wrist trauma. The physis (growth plate) is a relatively weak area of bone and is susceptible to injury, particularly during the adolescent growth spurt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Physeal fractures are described using the Salter-Harris classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H730724\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Physeal fractures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a nondisplaced Salter I physeal fracture of the distal radius or ulna (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 1</a>) usually have normal plain radiographs at initial presentation. However, bony tenderness is present over the physis in these patients and helps to differentiate this injury from a bruise or ligamentous strain or sprain. Other radiographic findings that may be present soon after injury include a volar fat pad on the lateral view and epiphyseal widening on stress views. However, stress views are painful for the patient and usually unnecessary. Plain radiographs obtained at least seven days after injury will show healing bone in children with nondisplaced Salter I fractures and also provides a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H732244\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Nondisplaced Salter I fracture'</a>.)</p><p>The main concern with physeal fractures is premature closure and growth arrest at the site of injury. The risk of this complication increases with the severity of the fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management#H43\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Management of distal radial physeal fractures is discussed in greater detail separately.

These fractures are typically associated with distal radial fractures. Complete fractures through the base of the ulnar styloid are uncommon but may be associated with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) instability since the TFCC attaches at the ulnar styloid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57244\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57244 \">image 3</a>). A distal ulna physeal fracture in association with a radial shaft fracture is a pediatric variation of the Galeazzi fracture pattern and often requires operative stabilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H730752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Ulnar styloid fractures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment#H730759\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;, section on 'Galeazzi fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Management of ulnar styloid fractures is reviewed separately.

Failure to recognize carpal fractures can result in long-term functional deficits and major complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Scaphoid fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scaphoid (navicular) fractures are the most common carpal fractures. Scaphoid fractures typically occur in individuals aged 15 to 30 years; they are particularly common among collegiate football players. Scaphoid fractures are rare in children younger than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Injury patterns in children are similar to adults. Although 90 percent of pediatric scaphoid fractures will heal with immobilization, three months or more may be needed. Almost one-third of pediatric patients will initially present with chronic nonunions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures#H3513896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The patient typically complains of pain along the radial aspect of the wrist after falling on an outstretched hand. The pain may be less severe than the patient or patient's parents expect from an acute fracture. Characteristic examination findings include tenderness of the anatomic snuff box, decreased range of motion in flexion and extension, pain with radial deviation or extension of the wrist, and a positive scaphoid compression test. The scaphoid compression test is performed by holding the thumb and gradually pushing in toward the scaphoid along the longitudinal axis of the thumb metacarpal; elicitation of pain over the palmar scaphoid tubercle constitutes a positive test. Complications of scaphoid fractures include carpal instability, osteonecrosis, and nonunion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;, section on 'Symptoms and examination findings'</a>.)</p><p>On plain radiographs, scaphoid fractures are best visualized with the anteroposterior (AP) scaphoid view with 30 degrees of ulnar deviation. They may not be evident on the standard wrist series, even if the ulnar deviation view is included. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;, section on 'Management of suspected acute fracture with negative plain radiographs'</a>.)</p><p>If scaphoid fracture is suspected on the basis of clinical findings and the radiographs are normal, the wrist should be immobilized in a thumb spica splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79534\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79534 \">figure 3</a>) pending confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis at follow-up examination (with radiographs) 10 to 14 days after the injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75655 \">image 4</a>). If the diagnosis must be confirmed or excluded in a shorter timeframe (eg, in an elite athlete), bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;, section on 'Management of suspected acute fracture with negative plain radiographs'</a>.)</p><p>The management of scaphoid fractures is discussed separately.

However, triquetral fractures may also occur following flexion injuries in which fragments of the triquetrum may be avulsed by the strong dorsal ligaments. Triquetral fractures are associated with carpal instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triquetrum-fractures#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triquetrum fractures&quot;, section on 'Clinical anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triquetrum-fractures#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triquetrum fractures&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically present with a history of injury and pain on the ulnar aspect of the wrist. Examination findings include pain and point tenderness either dorsally directly over the triquetrum, or on the ulnar border of the wrist, distal to the ulnar styloid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 4</a>). The triquetrum is most easily palpated with the wrist in radial deviation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triquetrum-fractures#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triquetrum fractures&quot;, section on 'Symptoms and examination findings'</a>.)</p><p>Most triquetral fractures can be demonstrated on plain radiographs, particularly a partially pronated AP view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59010\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59010 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81364\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81364 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67772\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67772 \">image 7</a>). Lateral views must be examined closely for any malalignment or instability pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triquetrum-fractures#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triquetrum fractures&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>.)</p><p>The management of triquetral fractures is discussed separately.

The swinging action required in these sports transfers force directly to the hook of the hamate. The wrist nearest the handle is most susceptible (eg, the nondominant hand in baseball or golf, the dominant hand in racquet sports). Fractures of the body of the hamate typically result from significant crush injuries (eg, a fall while holding an object in which the object lands between the ground and the ulnar side of the palm). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamate-fractures#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamate fractures&quot;, section on 'History and mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>Patients may present with acute or chronic pain that can be mild. The typical presentation involves sharp ulnar pain after missing a swing or striking a stationary object. The pain progresses to a dull, ill-defined discomfort during sports-related but not daily activities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamate-fractures#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamate fractures&quot;, section on 'History and mechanism of injury'</a>.)</p><p>On examination, there is point tenderness over the hook of the hamate, located just distal and lateral to the pisiform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 5</a>) and the hook of the hamate pull test is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90034 \">figure 6</a>). Callus or skin changes from repeated trauma may be noted overlying the area of the hamate. Associated ulnar motor and sensory deficit may be present (eg, paresthesia in <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain with resisted flexion of the fourth and fifth digits) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F53902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53902 \">table 2</a>).

Although most distal radial fractures in children are unintentional and occur after falls on an outstretched hand, metaphyseal chip or &quot;corner&quot; fractures are highly specific for child abuse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50274\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50274 \">figure 7</a>).

In many parts of the world (including the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia), a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required for cases of suspected abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;, section on 'Reporting suspected abuse'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LIGAMENTOUS AND CAPSULAR INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complex anatomic relationship of the carpal bones and multiple ligamentous attachments helps to stabilize the wrist while permitting considerable mobility. However, when exposed to forces outside of their physiologic range as may occur in a fall, motor vehicle accident, or high-impact contact with another player, ball, or other object, ligamentous injury can occur.</p><p>Ligamentous injuries encompass stretching (simple sprain) and partial or complete tears, which lead to instability and dislocation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A simple sprain involves stretching of the supporting ligaments of the radiocarpal joint; the usual mechanism is a fall on an extended wrist. Simple sprains are associated with mild pain or stiffness and normal range of motion. A detailed history and clinical examination must be performed to exclude more serious injuries (eg, type I Salter-Harris distal radius fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 1</a>), carpal fracture, or carpal instability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Patients with a simple sprain should have no bony tenderness over the distal radius and normal plain radiographs of the wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61652\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61652 \">image 11</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Fractures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Wrist instability and dislocation'</a> below.)</p><p>Based upon our experience, most of these injuries resolve within two weeks with conservative therapy including rest, ice, immobilization of the wrist in 20 degrees of dorsiflexion and gentle flexion and extension of the wrist as pain allows. If pain persists, referral to a sports medicine specialist or orthopedic surgeon is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Wrist instability and dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal instability refers to the failure of the wrist joint to properly transfer kinematic loads and misalignment of the carpal bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Frank dislocations, which are closely related, involve the loss of contact between one or more carpal bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Traumatic wrist instability is rare in children.

Acute dislocations also may be accompanied by fractures of the radial shaft (Galeazzi fracture).</p><p>Traumatic wrist instability is most likely to occur in contact sports and those that require twisting of the wrist (football, basketball, rugby, ice hockey, tennis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Similar to simple sprains, the typical mechanism of injury for carpal instability is a fall on an extended wrist. Radiographs in patients with instability are usually normal but must be carefully reviewed for malalignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80973\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80973 \">figure 8</a>).

Perilunate dislocation may be complicated by carpal tunnel syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The lateral radiograph demonstrates dorsal displacement of the capitate on the lunate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77044\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77044 \">image 13</a>) or, in palmar lunate dislocation, palmar displacement of the lunate into the carpal tunnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Perilunate dislocation is inherently a severe injury as all ligamentous attachments to the lunate, including both the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments have been severed.

The piano key test is performed on a pronated wrist; it is positive if ballottement of the ulnar head in a palmar direction produces little resistance compared with the other side. Alternatively, the patient forcibly presses both palms into the examination table; exaggerated dorsal-palmar translation compared with the opposite side indicates DRUJ instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>].</p><p>Imaging of the DRUJ begins with plain radiographs, although plain radiographs are often normal, particularly with mild DRUJ instability.
