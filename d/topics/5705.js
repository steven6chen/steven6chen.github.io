Previous studies evaluating the impact of dry eyes on quality of life show that patients with moderate to severe dry eye report utility scores similar to patients with moderate to severe angina or patients receiving dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>In addition, patients with dry eye incur direct medical costs through frequent visits to health care professionals, as well as pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies. Indirect costs include decreased productivity and time lost from work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A cost-analysis study estimates an overall annual cost of USD $55.4 billion to the United States from a societal perspective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dry eye has a complex and multifactorial etiology. The tear film of the eye consists of aqueous, mucous, and lipid components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64230 \">figure 1</a>). A healthy tear film relies on a synergistic interaction of the lacrimal glands, eyelids, and ocular surface, which together comprise the lacrimal functional unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Dysfunction of any component in the lacrimal functional unit can lead to dry eye disease.</p><p>Dry eye is classified into two general groups: decreased tear production and increased evaporative loss. In both groups, tear film hyperosmolarity and subsequent ocular surface inflammation lead to the variety of symptoms and signs associated with dry eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased tear production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired lacrimal tear production can be caused by any form of lacrimal gland destruction or dysfunction. The reduced volume of aqueous fluid leads to hyperosmolarity of the tear film and subsequently the ocular surface, which incites inflammation of the ocular surface cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Deficiency of aqueous tear production can further be subclassified into Sj&ouml;gren's and non-Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune exocrinopathy in which there is inflammatory infiltration of the lacrimal glands leading to cell death and tear hyposecretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, aqueous tear-deficient dry eye involves lacrimal dysfunction without associated systemic findings. The most common form is age-related dry eye in which it is believed that there is lacrimal ductal obstruction over time, leading to decreased lacrimal gland function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Lacrimal gland obstruction can also be due to conjunctival scarring conditions such as trachoma, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and ocular burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trachoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trachoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Non-Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, aqueous tear-deficient dry eye can also be caused by lacrimal gland infiltration. Infiltrative etiologies include sarcoidosis, lymphoma, graft versus host disease, and episcleritis. In addition, contact lens use is associated with reduced corneal sensitivity and subsequently reduced reflex sensory tear secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Diabetes mellitus is also associated with non-Sj&ouml;gren's aqueous deficient dry eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=episcleritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Episcleritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased evaporative loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive water loss from the ocular surface without any lacrimal dysfunction leads to tear film instability and a similar cycle of tear hyperosmolarity and lacrimal functional unit inflammation that is seen with decreased tear production. Increased tear evaporation is most commonly caused by meibomian gland dysfunction, also known as posterior blepharitis, in which the accessory lacrimal glands responsible for the lipid component of the tear film are dysfunctional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The amphiphilic nature of the lipid layer allows even spreading of the tear film to form a membrane and provides a barrier to minimize evaporation of tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Abnormalities of the lipid layer are associated with a higher rate of tear film evaporation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Structural abnormalities of eyelid position or decreased blink function also increase evaporation of the tear film by increasing the area or the time of tear film exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. Lastly, topical medicated or preserved eye drop use, chronic contact lens wear, and ocular allergy syndromes can cause ocular surface irritation and increased tear film evaporation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms in dry eye disease result from activation of sensory nerves of the ocular surface, either due to tear hyperosmolarity, the presence of inflammatory mediators, or hypersensitivity of the sensory nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Most patients will present with symptoms of chronic eye irritation associated with mild to moderate discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, there is considerable variability in patient-reported symptoms and clinically measurable signs over time, as well as a recognized lack of correlation between these symptoms and signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/25,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28-30</a>].</p><p>A good patient history may elicit many of the complaints below, as well as inciting or exacerbating causes (including medications, windy conditions, cold weather, low humidity environment, time of day).</p><p>Common eye complaints include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dryness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General irritation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gritty sensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning sensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign body sensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive tearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light sensitivity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurred vision</p><p/><p>The blurred vision associated with dry eyes tends to be quite variable. Since the tear film is the first layer encountered by light rays as they enter the eye, an irregular tear film can degrade the quality of the image that is received by the retina. The visual impairment associated with dry eyes is usually temporary and often improves with treatment of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Rarely, in severe dry eye conditions, permanent damage to visual acuity can occur from corneal scarring.</p><p>If ocular complaints are accompanied by mouth dryness and other systemic complaints, an evaluation for Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome should be performed.

The diagnosis can often be made at the office of the primary care clinician. The physical examination may also give clues to other associated conditions.</p><p>Dry eye disease can vary considerably in its intensity over time and under different environmental conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62824\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62824 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75685 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75497 \">picture 3</a>).

The patient should discontinue unnecessary systemic or ocular medications that can contribute to dryness. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The first line of treatment in patients complaining of dry eye includes tear supplementation and environmental coping strategies. Although several therapies discussed below have been studied in randomized trials, these studies have been limited by small sample size, lack of placebo control, and non-standardized clinical endpoints. Clinical trials of dry eye are also limited by the lack of clear diagnostic criteria for the condition. Thus, assessment of treatment efficacy is difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a> generally include cellulose to maintain viscosity, a spreading agent such as polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol to prevent evaporation, and a preservative to prevent contamination. Available without a prescription, &quot;artificial tears&quot; come in liquid, gel, and ointment forms. Preservative-free forms of these supplements are often recommended as some individuals with dry eye will have inflammatory reactions to the preservatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, these are often expensive, single-use formulations.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a> are considered first-line treatment for dry eye and have been shown to improve irritative symptoms in patients with dry eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/9,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,42</a>]. Artificial tears can also improve visual acuity in patients with dry eye symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a> have shown some efficacy in randomized trials, but these trials are mostly limited due to sample size, lack of an adequate control group, and non-standardized outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. As laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is a refractive procedure that causes dry eyes, in part due to decreased postoperative corneal sensation, LASIK serves as a model for assessing treatment of dry eye. Artificial tears given to postoperative LASIK patients appear to improve dry eye symptoms compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Issues related to dry eye and LASIK are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-refractive-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser refractive surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A reasonable starting dose for artificial tear administration is one drop in each eye, four times per day. Patients often begin to notice improvement within a few days of initiating treatment but may take up to three to four weeks to note a significant change in their symptoms. If individuals remain symptomatic, the frequency of artificial tear use can be increased to the level of symptoms, even as frequently as every hour. If used more often than four to six times per day, it is recommended that a preservative-free formulation be used to minimize the potential for toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Higher-viscosity artificial tear gels and ointments are also commercially available and can be used if patients feel that the eye drops are not providing enough symptomatic relief. Patients should be warned that the gels, and especially ointments, can blur vision temporarily and are often best used at bedtime.</p><p>Unless there is a specific inciting factor that can be eliminated, dry eyes are most often a chronic condition and require chronic treatment. Patients should be advised that they will need to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> for relief of dry eye symptoms indefinitely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental coping strategies address the importance of environmental causes that could be contributing to or even causing dry eye symptoms. One important strategy includes frequent blinking, especially during visually attentive tasks such as reading or computer use. The patient should also be urged to minimize exposure to air conditioning or heating. Humidifiers are useful in the bedroom, office, or any space where the patient spends a significant amount of time.</p><p>Swim goggles or other &quot;moisture chambers&quot; are recommended to protect the humidity of the local environment around the eyes. Moisture chambers can be purchased and fitted to current glasses in select optical shops by trained opticians (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75764\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75764 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52738\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52738 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is an immunosuppressive agent that has been found to be relatively safe, to be well-tolerated, and to improve signs and symptoms of dry eyes significantly in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].</p><p>A 2013 systematic review of 18 randomized trials concluded that topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> was a safe treatment for dry eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. While meta-analysis was not possible because of lack of standardized criteria and outcome measures, all nine trials that evaluated symptoms and 13 of 18 trials that evaluated tear function found improvement. No improvements were found in patients with dry eyes from surgical procedures, contact lens use, or thyroid orbitopathy. In a prospective cohort study of 158 patients with persistent dry eye symptoms despite <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, patients in all three severity groups (mild, moderate, severe) receiving cyclosporine showed improvement in symptoms, Schirmer scores, and mean tear breakup times compared with baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dry-eyes/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Despite the available evidence, we have not seen such a degree of beneficial results in our practice. There appears to be a subset of patients who do respond favorably to this treatment, but there are no good predictive models available to guide clinical decision-making at this time. In the author&rsquo;s anecdotal experience, patients with evidence of local mild inflammation on the ocular surface or a systemic condition associated with inflammation tend to have the highest likelihood of response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> drops.</p><p>A 0.05% emulsion of cyclosporin is available for treatment of dry eye disease.

Serum cyclosporine concentrations have been undetectable or negligible with topical use, and no systemic toxicity has been reported. Cyclosporine can cause an occasional, temporary burning sensation in the eye.

Dry eye is generally due to decreased tear production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive evaporative loss. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients present with symptoms of chronic eye irritation, such as eye dryness, red eyes, and burning.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no single definitive diagnostic test to identify or classify the severity of dry eye disease. The diagnosis is based primarily on patient symptoms and supportive findings of dry eye from examination.
