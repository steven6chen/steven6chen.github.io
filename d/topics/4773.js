The most serious form, hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), occurs in 10 to 40 percent of patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients are particularly at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Severe HC is less frequent even in HCT recipients, accounting for 10 percent or less in several series; however, it can be fatal.</p><p>Cystitis in patients with cancer can be separated into three broad categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystitis can result from primary bladder cancer or adjacent cancers that encroach upon the bladder from the prostate, uterus, cervix, or rectum. These neoplasms can lead to tumor necrosis with ulceration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious cystitis can develop since cancer patients are immunocompromised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HC can result directly from antineoplastic treatment. Radiation cystitis may result when the bladder is within the radiation treatment volume during treatment for pelvic neoplasms, such as prostate or cervical cancer. Chemotherapy-induced cystitis can arise from agents directly instilled into the bladder as part of a treatment program for superficial cancer of the bladder or for toxic metabolites of renally excreted antineoplastic agents, which come in contact with the bladder.</p><p/><p>The etiologies, manifestations, and treatment of cystitis secondary to cancer treatment (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) will be reviewed here. Cystitis caused by intravesical instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), used in the management of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-intravesical-bcg-immunotherapy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of intravesical BCG immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Localized disease'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystitis is inflammation of the mucosal surface of the bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ureters. Patients may experience urgency, frequent urination of small volumes, and a painful burning sensation with urination. Suprapubic pain is common; however, flank or back pain should raise the possibility of upper urinary tract disease. In men, bladder spasms often produce severe referred pain in the glans penis. Pain or lesions in the external genitalia can also be associated with herpetic disease or mucosal candidal infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with infectious cystitis, examination of the urine often demonstrates white blood cells (WBC) and a few red blood cells (RBC). However, the absence of WBC in a patient who is neutropenic following chemotherapy does not exclude a urinary tract infection. In the immunocompetent host, bacterial colony counts of greater than 100,000 in the urine are considered diagnostic of a urinary tract infection. It is not yet resolved whether this threshold should be lowered in neutropenic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sampling and evaluation of voided urine in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Along with routine urinalysis and bacterial culture, viral cultures, cytology, and special molecular techniques may be required to demonstrate unusual pathogens in the severely immunocompromised patient (eg, after hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]). If lesions are present on the external genitalia, a smear and culture can be performed for direct fluorescence antibody detection and growth of HSV.</p><p>Bleeding can be the most prominent manifestation in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). Severe HC can be life threatening, and assessment of hemodynamic stability is imperative. A complete blood count to assess for neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia should be performed at presentation. Serum creatinine should be measured to assess renal function. If hemorrhage is prominent, coagulation parameters such as prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times should be checked.</p><p>An exhaustive history of past and present medications is important since some chemotherapeutic agents may produce cystitis years after exposure (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>). The patient should be asked about use of over the counter and non-traditional medications or preparations. Cystoscopy can confirm the diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis. In cases of substantial blood loss, cystoscopy also can serve to localize a bleeding source that may be amenable to fulguration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic cystourethroscopy for gynecologic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of HC includes tumor involvement of the bladder. This could be due to direct tumor invasion from adjacent structures, a local recurrence of primary bladder cancer, or a second primary arising in the bladder. Diagnostic evaluation should include appropriate radiological imaging, urine cytology, and bladder biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIOUS CYSTITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious agents responsible for cystitis in the cancer patient include both bacteria, which commonly cause infection in immunocompetent patients, and more unusual pathogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Common urinary pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical urinary pathogens include Escherichia coli, Proteus sp, Klebsiella sp, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Coagulase negative staphylococci can occasionally produce cystitis in patients with indwelling bladder catheters or urinary tract pathology but are also frequent contaminants in a poorly collected specimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracellular pathogens such as Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma are rare causes of cystitis in the cancer patient. HSV can cause urethritis but rarely cystitis. Candida albicans and C. glabrata have been reported to cause cystitis that is often hemorrhagic in severely immunocompromised hosts. In the United States, parasitic pathogens are distinctly uncommon. However, Schistosoma haematobium infection should be considered in patients from endemic regions such as Egypt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer patients are treated in the same fashion for routine bacterial cystitis as other patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>). However, if fever occurs during the neutropenic period, intravenous antibiotics are warranted. Patients without symptoms referable to the urinary tract should have a thorough search for other sites of infection before ascribing the fever to cystitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Care should be taken to make sure antibiotic choices are compatible with the antineoplastic regimen. As an example, there are some data to suggest that the full therapeutic strength of trimethoprim-containing antibiotics may increase the myelosuppressive effects of methotrexate-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> can be used in patients with genital HSV lesions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a>). Cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients receiving valacyclovir. External mucosal candidiasis can be treated with any of the imidazole topical agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Overview of clinical uses'</a>). Severe cases may require oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>. However, some Candida sp are resistant or less reliably susceptible to fluconazole, such as C. krusei and C. glabrata.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious form of cystitis in cancer patients is hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). This is characterized by diffuse bladder mucosal inflammation with hemorrhage involving the entire bladder. The bleeding can range from minimal (5 to 50 red blood cells [RBC] per high powered field on microscopic examination of the urine), to massive, requiring transfusion to maintain hemoglobin levels. Among patients who develop severe HC despite vigorous preventive measures, a 2 to 4 percent mortality rate has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Disorders in hemostasis due to systemic manifestations of the cancer or its treatment (eg, thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation) can exacerbate bleeding in susceptible patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>HC can be caused by radiation, chemotherapy, and infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite improved techniques in delivering ionizing radiation for the treatment of pelvic neoplasms, HC is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening complication of radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although HC has been reported to occur in up to 9 percent of patients who have received full dose RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], it is severe in less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After the administration of pelvic radiation, the bladder mucosa is initially edematous and friable. Later, there is a progressive endarteritis which leads to tissue hypoxia, ischemia, necrosis and atrophy and fibrosis of the mucosa and submucosa with the development of dilated fragile telangiectatic blood vessels that tend to bleed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The interval between the onset of hemorrhagic cystitis and prior RT varies from months to years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>].The diagnosis is based on excluding other causes of hematuria, including urinary tract infection, and malignancy such as a bladder cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy-induced cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various chemotherapeutic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabazitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabazitaxel</a>, can cause either non-hemorrhagic or hemorrhagic cystitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66805 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Of all the chemotherapeutic agents, the oxazaphosphorine alkylating agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> most frequently cause HC. This complication was described shortly after the introduction of cyclophosphamide to clinical use in 1958 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. HC is caused by urinary excretion of acrolein, a hepatic metabolite of both cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. The incidence of HC is increased with higher individual doses, larger cumulative doses, and the use of ifosfamide as opposed to cyclophosphamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Progressive mucosal changes can be identified in the bladder mucosa of patients receiving high cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide or prolonged treatment for longer than 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>During treatment, patients may develop irritative bladder symptoms or hematuria. Long term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> use has been associated with the development of aggressive forms of transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Both the cumulative dose of the drug and the occurrence of HC appear to increase the risk for this tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;, section on 'Chemical carcinogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>There are no reports on the association of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> with bladder cancer in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HC is commonly seen in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Early post-transplant HC (defined as occurring within 72 hours of the preparative regimen) is frequently associated with the use of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, while later HC frequently results from viral infections, such as BK virus and adenovirus type 11 (AdV-11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. It is hypothesized that virally mediated HC represents reactivation of a latent form of the virus in the post-transplant period. In one study, recipient seropositivity for AdV-11 was highly predictive for the development of AdV-11-induced HC following allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-jc-polyomavirus-bk-polyomavirus-and-other-polyomavirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of JC polyomavirus, BK polyomavirus, and other polyomavirus infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Viral HC can be dramatic in presentation but usually resolves spontaneously within less than two weeks with supportive care, including hydration and pain control. Virus culture is rarely used to detect JC and BK virus infection outside of a research setting. Cytologic examination can be used to detect urinary shedding of polyomaviruses. The most characteristic abnormality of polyomavirus-infected cells is an enlarged nucleus with a single large basophilic intranuclear inclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Grading the severity of hemorrhagic cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several investigators and groups have used various grading schemes based upon the level of intervention required for therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53812 \">table 2</a>). Mild HC involves only outpatient management with hydration, is transient, and does not require transfusion or clot extraction. Moderate HC requires extraction and prevention of clots with continuous bladder irrigation, cystoscopy, and instillation of astringents such as alum or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>. Severe HC requires transfusions and more intensive interventions such as formalin instillation, embolization, urinary diversion and cystectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best treatment for HC is prevention. Effective prophylactic regimens include continuous bladder irrigation, suprahydration, and parenteral or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesna</a> (2-mercaptoethane sodium sulfonate, a sulfhydryl compound). However, once HC is established, the optimal treatment depends upon the degree or grade of hematuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81902 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Careful attention to the earliest symptoms of cystitis is important to prevent progression to more severe HC. Irritative symptoms associated with low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> therapy should be treated promptly. Patients receiving high dose cyclophosphamide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> should be instructed to drink at least two liters of fluid a day and to void at first sensation. Oral fluids should be ingested prior to sleep and patients should awaken once during the night to empty the bladder. Irritative symptoms alone are not a contraindication to continued cyclophosphamide therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Suprahydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of suprahydration (intravenous normal saline at 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> sufficient to maintain urinary output &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span> was evaluated in a series of 100 consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous HCT with high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In this series, HC developed in 7 percent of patients, and it was clinically significant in only two. The cost was significantly less ($20 per course) than the cost of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesna</a> (estimated $1500 per course).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesna</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a> has been shown to be an effective uroprotective agent in patients who receive oxazaphosphorine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Within minutes of intravenous administration, mesna is oxidized to a stable inactive disulfide in the serum but is reactivated in the kidney. In the urine, it binds to acrolein, creating an inert thioether that is excreted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
