There are many different status epilepticus syndromes, defined by clinical features and EEG findings. Causes, prognoses, and treatments differ, and optimal evaluation and treatment requires an understanding of both the type of status epilepticus and the underlying cause. Some forms of status epilepticus are associated with an excellent prognosis, while others can have major morbidity or even mortality.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of convulsive status epilepticus in adults is discussed here; treatment is reviewed separately. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus and the diagnosis and management of status epilepticus in children are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-complications-of-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and complications of status epilepticus in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of convulsive status epilepticus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17916977\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of continuous seizure activity used to define status epilepticus has varied over time. Historically, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and others defined status epilepticus as a single epileptic seizure of &gt;30 minutes duration or a series of epileptic seizures during which function is not regained between ictal events in a 30 minute period<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Because of the clinical urgency in treating generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE), however, a 30 minute definition is neither practical nor appropriate in clinical practice. Once seizures have continued for more than a few minutes, treatment should begin without further delay.</p><p>Considering the need for rapid evaluation and intervention in GCSE to avoid cardiovascular morbidity and refractory status, an accepted operational definition of GCSE consists of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;5 minutes of continuous seizures, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;2 discrete seizures between which there is incomplete recovery of consciousness</p><p/><p>In 2015, the ILAE published a revised conceptual definition of status epilepticus that incorporates two operational dimensions, t1 and t2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Status epilepticus is a condition resulting from either the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms that lead to abnormally prolonged seizures (after time point t1)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Status epilepticus is a condition that can have long-term consequences (after time point t2), including neuronal death, neuronal injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures</p><p/><p>For GCSE, the ILAE proposal specifies that t1 and t2 are 5 and 30 minutes, respectively, based on the best available data from animal and clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For other types of status epilepticus, the most appropriate time intervals for t1 and t2 have not been well defined and are far more speculative, particularly for nonconvulsive status. The ILAE suggests using a t1 and t2 of 10 and &gt;60 minutes for focal status epilepticus with impaired consciousness (often labeled complex partial status epilepticus) and a t1 of 10 to 15 minutes for absence status epilepticus. There are no available data to suggest any particular t2 for absence status epilepticus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported yearly incidence of status epilepticus ranges from 7 to 41 cases per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most population-based studies have defined status epilepticus using a duration of at least 30 minutes.</p><p>The wide range of reported incidence rates is likely due to differences in case ascertainment and the populations being studied. In addition, some studies have included both convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), while others have excluded NCSE. In a study that included only generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE), the reported incidence rate was 7 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The incidence of status epilepticus follows a U-shaped distribution, with relatively high incidence rates in children less than one year of age and then rising again in older adults over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Over a lifetime, up to 10 percent of adults with epilepsy and 20 percent of children with epilepsy will have one or more episodes of status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of status epilepticus in adults are symptomatic of an underlying structural brain lesion or a toxic or metabolic disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the underlying medical or structural cause is of recent origin, status epilepticus is referred to as acute symptomatic. Many episodes come from a combination of an earlier lesion (ie, remote symptomatic) and a superimposed new metabolic, infectious, or pharmacologic stressor such as uremia or a medication change.</p><p>Status epilepticus also commonly arises in patients with an established diagnosis of focal or generalized idiopathic epilepsy. Status epilepticus is occasionally the presenting manifestation of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Common causes of convulsive status epilepticus vary by age. In children, febrile status epilepticus is the most common etiology, accounting for approximately one third of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-complications-of-status-epilepticus-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and complications of status epilepticus in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and etiology'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, the most common etiologies are acute symptomatic, accounting for approximately half of all cases, followed by remote symptomatic and low antiseizure drug levels in a patient with known epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Examples of some of the more common causes in adults include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute structural brain injury (eg, stroke, head trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral anoxia or hypoxia), infection (encephalitis, meningitis, abscess), or brain tumor.

Antibodies to components of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are among the more common causes. In one single-center series of 570 consecutive episodes of status epilepticus in adults, 2.5 percent of cases were categorized as autoimmune [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Specific etiologies included multiple sclerosis (four cases), anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (two cases), adult-onset Rasmussen encephalitis (one case), Hashimoto encephalitis (one case), and complications of lupus vasculitis with hemorrhagic stroke (one case). Clinical presentations can range from convulsive status epilepticus to confusional or amnestic states. Autoimmune cases are often more refractory to treatment compared with other causes of status epilepticus but may respond favorably to immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Patients typically do not respond readily to antiseizure drugs and mortality and morbidity are high.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H567989\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Status epilepticus, like seizures, is categorized electroclinically according to whether seizure activity is focal or generalized. In many cases, however, generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) cannot be separated easily into cases with a primarily generalized onset versus those with focal onset and secondary generalization. Most GCSE has some evidence of a focal onset or focal lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The distinction between focal and generalized onset has clinical implications: in cases with focal onset, a causative lesion must be sought; in primary generalized epilepsies, certain antiseizure drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>) should be avoided if the patient is having myoclonic or absence seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis#H2329061445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Other second or third line drugs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis#H2329061463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Myoclonic status epilepticus'</a>.)</p><p>Both focal and generalized status epilepticus can be further classified according to whether clinical seizure activity is convulsive or nonconvulsive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97140\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97140 \">table 1</a>). Convulsive forms of status epilepticus are the focus of this topic; nonconvulsive status epilepticus is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Classifying the type of status epilepticus is important because it is a major factor in determining morbidity and, therefore, the aggressiveness of treatment that is required. For the purposes of this topic, we consider forms of status epilepticus with significant motor (movement) manifestations, including generalized, focal motor, myoclonic, and tonic, to be convulsive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1217713551\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with convulsive status epilepticus present with characteristic motor manifestations that vary according to the seizure type. While patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) have obvious bilateral tonic and clonic motor activity and loss of consciousness, patients with focal motor status epilepticus may have jerking movements restricted to one area of the body, usually with preserved consciousness. Myoclonic status epilepticus typically involves much more rapid, but lower amplitude, jerking muscle activity, but with marked variability. Tonic status epilepticus includes slower, more sustained maintenance of a posture, or slow movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161854190\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized convulsive status epilepticus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GCSE is the most dramatic form of status epilepticus, with the potential for serious complications, morbidity and even mortality. GCSE includes both primary generalized and secondarily generalized convulsive seizures. There is always impaired consciousness and bilateral tonic stiffening, followed by rhythmic jerking of the limbs (clonus) that is usually symmetric.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161854197\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal motor status epilepticus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal status epilepticus has many clinical manifestations, largely depending on the location of the epileptogenic brain area. Focal motor status epilepticus is the most easily recognized. It may have progression of focal jerking activity of a limb (a &ldquo;Jacksonian march&rdquo;) or widespread but unilateral jerking muscle activity, with or without impaired consciousness.</p><p>In almost all cases, there is an associated focal lesion, although the lesion is not always evident on imaging. Examples of causative lesions include heterotopias, vascular or infectious lesions, and tumors. Occasionally, benign idiopathic focal epilepsies lead to status epilepticus of the same type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Benign focal epilepsies of childhood'</a>.)</p><p>A particularly refractory focal motor status epilepticus with very prolonged and very regular jerking activity is called epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). EPC can be remarkably persistent, with epileptic focal repetitive jerking activity lasting days, weeks, or even decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Causes include heterotopias, inflammatory or infectious lesions (eg, tuberculosis, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis), vascular lesions, neoplasms, congenital malformations, and Rasmussen encephalitis. The jerking is often restricted to one part of the body, does not spread, and is often slower than in most other forms of focal motor status epilepticus.</p><p>Rasmussen encephalitis, although rare, is a relatively common cause of EPC that occurs in children and adolescents. It is usually manifested by refractory, unremitting focal seizures, progressive cerebral hemiatrophy with contralateral hemiparesis, and progressive cognitive dysfunction. It is often associated with periodic epileptiform discharges on EEG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Hemispheric syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia can also cause EPC. Although hyperglycemia and fluid and electrolyte disturbances provide a precipitant for seizures, there is usually an underlying focal cerebral lesion as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Blood glucose levels can be extremely high, often above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. The EPC associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia is usually readily treatable by correcting the metabolic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Myoclonic seizures are often generalized, but some are focal. The EEG demonstrates rapid epileptiform discharges time-locked to the movements &ndash; persuasive for an epileptic origin of the myoclonus. MSE has a remarkable variety of causes, often divided into epilepsy syndrome-related causes and symptomatic causes. Clinical presentations can be very similar from one syndrome to the next. Some occur in benign forms, and others have a poor prognosis.</p><p>Primary forms of epilepsy syndrome-related MSE are those in which myoclonus is a characteristic finding, such as in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]<strong>.</strong> Secondary epilepsy syndromes causing MSE are usually more severe, but myoclonus is not so prominent at baseline. While most of these syndromes occur in childhood (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), late-onset myoclonic epilepsy can be seen in adults with Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In other cases, MSE is symptomatic of more widespread neurologic dysfunction or an acute encephalopathy. The myoclonus may be more irregular than in other MSE. The most ominous cause is anoxia, but MSE may also be caused by a metabolic disturbance such as uremic or hepatic encephalopathy, or an encephalopathy caused by sepsis or multiple medical problems, such as a combination of uremia and sepsis (a typical cause) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. EEG in such cases shows the (often severe) encephalopathy and frequent, brief, sometimes regular, epileptiform discharges. MSE due to these encephalopathies typically has a poor prognosis, determined almost entirely by the underlying medical illness. The clinical appearance of all these types of MSE may be very similar, and EEG features are often crucial in distinguishing the different etiologies and types of MSE. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> below.)</p><p>Not all episodes of persistent myoclonus are epileptic in origin; many are better labeled as &quot;status myoclonicus&quot; rather than truly epileptic. They include prolonged, continuous, but frequently non-rhythmic, myoclonic jerking, usually of large amplitude, often involving the face, trunk, and limbs, but sometimes multifocal or asynchronous. The cause is usually an acute, severe encephalopathy, particularly anoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], although metabolic disturbances are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Most patients are comatose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The EEG typically shows widespread slowing indicative of an encephalopathy, and the myoclonic jerks do not correlate with spikes or sharp waves. The prognosis depends on that of the underlying etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Following anoxia, it is usually fatal; with metabolic encephalopathies it is often reversible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161854211\"><span class=\"h2\">Tonic status epilepticus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tonic status epilepticus (TSE) is rare in adults. It consists of maintenance of a tonic posture, particularly of axial musculature, rather than frank convulsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It usually occurs in children with many different seizure types, particularly those who have major neurologic and cognitive deficits from birth or early childhood, such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The EEG may show wide-spread fast activity or very rapid spikes, but may also include periods of background suppression or attenuation. TSE can be difficult to interrupt with antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Benzodiazepines may exacerbate TSE at times.

In some cases of GCSE, a focal onset is evident on EEG, especially early in the episode, and this can help to focus the evaluation on an underlying focal cause. Once convulsions have ceased, EEG is crucial in determining whether status epilepticus has truly ended, or whether there is continuing seizure activity without convulsions.</p><p>In many cases of focal motor status epilepticus, EEG evidence of seizure activity is subtle or absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This is generally thought due to a deeper seizure focus or orientation of the seizure discharges such that they are not evident on surface, scalp EEGs. The seizures of focal status epilepticus can also be intermittent and thereby absent on a short EEG recording.</p><p>Certain EEG patterns in unresponsive patients are diagnostic of status epilepticus, including patterns that show temporal evolution. The meaning of other patterns, such as lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs; previously referred to as periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges or PLEDS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62133\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62133 \">waveform 1</a>), remains controversial, although aggressive pharmacologic treatment in a patient whose EEG shows only LPDs without evolution and whose examination reveals no clinical seizures should generally be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Continuous EEG recordings may be helpful if the initial study is not diagnostic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H2970645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalography'</a>.)</p><p>In myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE), EEG features can help to distinguish between the different etiologic groups, in turn helping to direct management. The genetic generalized myoclonic epilepsy syndromes of childhood, especially the benign syndromes, often show generalized polyspikes on a relatively normal background. In the secondary myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, there may be background slowing and less rhythmic and broader spikes, sometimes with periodic discharges. Cases with acute or remote symptomatic causes may show focal slowing; many show more widespread background slowing, indicative of an encephalopathy.</p><p>Cases with the particularly ominous MSE due to anoxia may show a very disturbed, nearly flat background EEG, indicative of an extremely severe encephalopathy and predictive of a poor prognosis. In MSE, the background EEG rhythm generally correlates better with prognosis than do the clinical manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H966515\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROIMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A noncontrast head CT obtained once the patient is stabilized may show hyperdensity consistent with acute hemorrhage or focal hypodensity indicative of ischemia or an underlying mass lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to show the structural lesions that may cause or precipitate status epilepticus. MRI is not necessary to diagnose status epilepticus, however, and cannot be performed until a patient is stabilized and seizures have been controlled.</p><p>Aside from underlying structural lesions that may identify the underlying cause of seizures, MRI can show reversible abnormalities related to the seizures themselves. Examples include areas of increased signal intensity on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2, or diffusion-weighted images, patchy contrast enhancement, and increased blood flow on perfusion-weighted imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59643 \">table 2</a>). These findings are thought to represent seizure-induced cellular edema. They are most often seen in cortical and limbic structures, particularly the hippocampus or other deep structures. Many are reversible but may last for weeks or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], especially if seizures are prolonged; they ultimately resolve or evolve into focal atrophy and sclerosis. It is not always easy to tell the difference between seizure-related findings and an underlying cause, and repeat imaging is sometimes necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Although the diagnosis of GCSE is usually obvious, a detailed neurologic examination is important in making the diagnosis of more subtle or focal forms of status epilepticus. (See <a href=\"#H1217713551\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Particularly important are assessment of the level of consciousness, observation for automatic movements or myoclonus, and any asymmetric features on examination that may indicate a focal structural lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Clinically obvious status epilepticus should be treated immediately; there is no need to wait for an EEG. An EEG is critical in the diagnosis of more subtle forms of status epilepticus, for distinguishing myoclonic status epilepticus from nonepileptic myoclonus, and in the aftermath of generalized convulsive status epilepticus to exclude ongoing nonconvulsive seizures. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17913476\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few other conditions appear similar to generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). Some movement disorders occasionally mimic status epilepticus. An EEG at the time of the movements and examination by an experienced clinician will differentiate them from status epilepticus. Many other conditions, mostly various causes of encephalopathies, may be hard to distinguish from nonconvulsive status epilepticus. An EEG will usually make the diagnosis, but some patterns are controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H2970645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalography'</a>.)</p><p>Although relatively uncommon, psychogenic status epilepticus should be considered in situations where there are bilateral motor movements with preserved consciousness. Although some frontal seizures can appear this way, GCSE does not. Video and EEG monitoring are the best way to establish the correct diagnosis. Not all seizures show up on an EEG, but prolonged episodes of impaired awareness or behavior without any changes on EEG are unlikely to represent true status epilepticus (remembering that the EEG often remains normal during simple partial seizures as well). Psychogenic status epilepticus is important to recognize, because iatrogenic injury can occur through over-treatment with benzodiazepines. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and psychogenic status epilepticus are discussed separately.

This establishes the critical point at which treatment must be initiated in order to avoid serious morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H17916977\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of status epilepticus follows a bimodal age distribution, with peak rates in children less than 1 year of age and adults over the age of 60 years. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiologies include acute brain injury or infection, noncompliance with antiseizure drug treatment, drug or alcohol withdrawal syndromes, and metabolic disturbances, among others. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classifying the type of status epilepticus is important because it is a major factor in determining morbidity and, therefore, the aggressiveness of treatment required. The four major forms of convulsive status epilepticus are generalized convulsive, focal motor, myoclonic, and tonic. Various forms of nonconvulsive status epilepticus are discussed separately (See <a href=\"#H567989\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with convulsive status epilepticus present with characteristic motor manifestations that vary according to the seizure type. While patients with generalized convulsive status have obvious bilateral tonic followed by clonic motor activity and loss of consciousness, patients with focal motor status may have motor jerking limited to one limb and retained awareness. (See <a href=\"#H1217713551\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GCSE is a clinical diagnosis, confirmed in most cases by the presence on exam of sustained and rhythmic generalized or focal tonic and clonic motor activity lasting for &ge;5 minutes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is necessary in the aftermath of GCSE to exclude ongoing nonconvulsive seizures and is mandatory for managing prolonged and refractory status epilepticus.
