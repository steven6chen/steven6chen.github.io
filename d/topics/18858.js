Despite this success, a substantial number of renal allograft recipients eventually require the permanent reinstitution of renal replacement therapy because of allograft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, approximately 13 percent of patients who received a renal allograft in 2006 had undergone a previous transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, among over 100,000 patients beginning dialysis in 2002, 4 percent had a failed renal allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The survival of such patients on dialysis appears to be relatively poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In a study of 4743 renal transplant recipients in Canada, for example, the risk of death was significantly higher with allograft failure versus those with continued allograft function (adjusted hazard ratio 3.4, 95% CI 2.75-4.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The reinstitution of dialysis after renal transplant failure presents the clinician with the dilemma of whether to withdraw immunosuppressive medications and, if withdrawal is initiated, the optimal method of tapering such therapy. The issues that must be addressed with the withdrawal of immunosuppression after renal transplant failure are reviewed in this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most compelling reasons to withdraw immunosuppressive medications in dialysis patients with a failed renal transplant are the increased risk of infection, malignancy, and complications associated with long-term corticosteroid immunosuppression use. Infection is the second leading cause of death in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another problem is that the dosing of some immunosuppressive agents is difficult in patients with renal failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased risk of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased risk of serious infections is observed in both transplant recipients (because of the direct effects of immunosuppressive medications) and dialysis patients (because of immune system derangements from uremia and access-related problems). These factors contribute to the unacceptably high incidence of infection in dialysis patients who continue to receive immunosuppressive medications after a renal allograft has failed. This is particularly concerning in the failed transplant patient utilizing a venous catheter on hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 197 patients returning to dialysis, the risk of infection was significantly increased in patients remaining on low-dose immunosuppression, compared with those in whom immunosuppression was withdrawn (1.7 versus 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">infections/patient-year,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Mortality and cardiovascular disease (odds ratios of 3.4 and 4.9) were also increased in the group on immunosuppression. Overall, the nephrectomy rate was 55 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were noted in a second retrospective review of a long- versus short-taper protocol: more infections occurred in the long-taper group (0.87 versus 0.72 <span class=\"nowrap\">infections/patient-year)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

This was suggested by a retrospective cohort study consisting of over 8000 first-transplant recipients in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplantation Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although the incidence of cancers after allograft failure in kidney transplant recipients was highly variable, the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma decreased markedly on reinstitution of dialysis, as did the incidence of lip cancer and melanoma. The decreased risk was generally observed for cancers associated with viral associations such as Kaposi sarcoma, which is associated with human herpes type 8, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is associated with Epstein-Barr virus. The decreased risk of lip cancer may have been due to the association of human papillomavirus and skin cancers. Although melanoma has no known infectious etiology, a causal relationship between immunosuppression and its development in recipients of kidney transplants has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications of corticosteroid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy are at risk for infectious as well as noninfectious complications, including osteoporosis, muscle wasting, cataracts, and hyperglycemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>).

Although transplant nephrectomy is a relatively safe, straightforward procedure, the addition of another major event at the same time of reinitiation of dialysis may be undesirable.</p><p>Studies examining patients treated in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> era have reported an incidence of required transplant nephrectomy ranging from 20 to 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/10,11,17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,17-22</a>]. The use of cyclosporine has been associated with a dramatic increase in the incidence of required transplant nephrectomies after the withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of one center's experience reported an incidence of 4 percent (2 of 46 patients) of required nephrectomy for patients administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> versus 21 percent (13 of 62) for those treated with a regimen that included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second center found that nephrectomy was required in 63 percent (19 of 30) of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> versus 27 percent (4 of 11) of those administered azathioprine and prednisone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>The reason for the possible association of graft nephrectomy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> use is unclear.

Less fulminant rejection may present with unusual symptoms, such as weight loss, anemia, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic disturbances, and resistance to erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESAs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have early graft failure (defined as a return to dialysis within one year of transplantation) are much more likely to develop a graft-related complication requiring nephrectomy than are those with late allograft failure, independent of whether immunosuppressive medications are withdrawn. Although such complications may be observed in patients in whom withdrawal is not initiated, the abrupt withdrawal of immunosuppression among those with early graft failure increases the risk of precipitating rejection that requires nephrectomy. In addition, the morbidity and mortality from nephrectomy has improved markedly over the last three decades. These observations have led most centers to adopt a policy of immediate withdrawal of immunosuppression combined with preemptive nephrectomy for patients with early allograft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p>By comparison, the immediate withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents followed by nephrectomy is less commonly performed for patients with late graft failure (greater than one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The possible indications for transplant nephrectomy in late allograft failure after initiation of dialysis are not clearly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but may be considered in patients with signs and symptoms of a chronic inflammatory state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Some clinicians, for example, advocate allograft removal with features of such an inflammatory state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], while others suggest nephrectomy only with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammation in renal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Analysis based upon the United States Renal Data System suggests that survival is improved after transplant nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Among nearly 11,000 dialysis patients with a failed kidney allograft, 32 percent underwent nephrectomy between 1994 and 2004. The relative risk for all-cause death was significantly lower for those with a transplant nephrectomy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.63-0.74). However, it is difficult to generalize these results since the study has several flaws; these include unclear reasons for nephrectomy as well as not defining the comorbid conditions that prevented a nephrectomy. Thus, patients who underwent nephrectomy may have been healthier than those in whom a nephrectomy was not performed. Whether survival is truly improved with nephrectomy requires additional evidence.</p><p>Although nephrectomy is the conventional approach to removing failed renal allografts, some centers have reported some success with vascular embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Further study is required to delineate the role for this technique in this setting, with some concern related to mortality and the absence of data with hematologic and biochemical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some patients have completed corticosteroid withdrawal at the time of allograft failure, most patients returning to dialysis continue to receive long-term corticosteroid therapy. These patients may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency following steroid withdrawal, although the evidence supporting this is controversial.</p><p>Dialysis patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency frequently present with subtle findings of isolated glucocorticoid insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. These include persistent fever, weakness, fatigability, myalgias, arthralgias, weight loss with subsequent fluid overload because of the lack of adequate ultrafiltration, mild hypercalcemia, and eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients undergo glucocorticoid withdrawal without adverse effects despite an abnormal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (eg, Cortrosyn stimulation test) or other laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>). One study, for example, evaluated 21 renal transplant recipients returning to dialysis; 14 initially displayed evidence of adrenal suppression as measured by either an ACTH challenge or an inadequate increase in plasma cortisol with insulin administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although the withdrawal of corticosteroids in all patients was associated with few adverse clinical events, 30 percent still had laboratory evidence of adrenal suppression when reassessed at six months.</p><p>In another series of 13 patients with renal transplant failure who returned to dialysis, seven with a normal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> were immediately removed from corticosteroid therapy, while six with equivocal test results were tapered over one to two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These withdrawals occurred without an adverse effect.</p><p>Thus, although the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing secondary adrenal insufficiency, a test that predicts the clinical response of patients in the setting of dialysis and concurrent withdrawal of long-term corticosteroids remains to be established. In general, the length of time required to recover normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function depends upon the degree of suppression; this, in turn, depends upon the dose and duration of the corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy. The time varies from a few weeks to as long as nine months or more. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since the findings of adrenal insufficiency in this patient population may be subtle, conservative clinical judgment combined with careful laboratory evaluation should be employed. As an example, patients who tolerate corticosteroid withdrawal under relatively nonstressful conditions may require a temporary increase in corticosteroid dose during periods of stress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The experience with steroid withdrawal in <strong>well-functioning</strong> renal transplants demonstrates that gradual corticosteroid withdrawal is not associated with symptomatic adrenal insufficiency. In a randomized trial of withdrawal of corticosteroids over a four-month period, one year after renal transplantation, only 1 of the 49 patients assigned to the withdrawal arm developed symptoms requiring reinstitution of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Thus, a longer taper of immunosuppression may permit the maintenance of some renal function while on dialysis. Although residual renal function is critical for the delivery of adequate doses of dialysis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], no studies have adequately addressed its importance in failed renal allografts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitization and retransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small studies have noted that patients who have undergone transplant nephrectomy have higher cytotoxic antibody levels than those undergoing dialysis with the allograft still in place:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two series, panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels of greater than 30 percent were more frequent in patients who had undergone transplant nephrectomy (57 versus 33 percent and 60 versus 30 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report examined 52 patients awaiting renal transplantation, of whom 12 and 14 underwent elective transplant nephrectomy and nephrectomy for symptoms, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Animal models of retransplantation have demonstrated that, to maintain tolerance and accept a second graft, the presence of donor antigen is beneficial. As an example, T cells adoptively transferred to an irradiated host may revert to a normal state of responsiveness in an antigen-free animal as opposed to an animal that bears the donor antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, in a rat heart transplantation model, graftectomy resulted in significantly reduced survival of the second allograft, thereby suggesting a tolerizing effect of residual antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Although this hypothesis has not been tested in humans, antigen-specific hyporeactivity induced by pretransplantation blood transfusions suggests that this mechanism is plausible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In humans, however, there appears to be no clinically significant difference in outcome after retransplantation among those with or without nephrectomy in the small, retrospective studies that have addressed this question. In addition, despite the above retrospective findings linking nephrectomy and sensitization, there is no proven causal relationship between nephrectomy and subsequent high PRA levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS OF WITHDRAWAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No controlled, prospective studies have been performed to determine the best method for <span class=\"nowrap\">tapering/withdrawing</span> immunosuppression following renal allograft failure. Most transplant centers have center-specific protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/7,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,49</a>]. Our approach is largely consistent with recommendations of the British Transplantation Society Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The following is our approach, which has resulted in a stable nephrectomy rate of approximately 30 percent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We and most transplant centers have adopted a policy of immediate withdrawal of immunosuppression combined with preemptive nephrectomy for patients with early allograft failure, which is defined as failure that occurs less than one year after transplant surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We also withdraw immunosuppression with later allograft failure, with no one remaining on any type of immunosuppression for longer than six months from the time of allograft failure. Our standard protocol is to immediately withdraw <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil; we subsequently taper <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/month</span> until the drug is discontinued, carefully watching for symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and rejection. Observation for symptoms of rejection requires over a year in most patients, and the signs may be subtle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We have a different approach if the patient has continued to produce urine despite allograft failure. In this setting, we prefer to withdraw the antimetabolite immediately, reduce the calcineurin inhibitor dose to once daily in the morning, and reduce the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose to 5 mg per day; both remaining immunosuppressive agents are tapered slowly over three to six months. This approach allows the patient to obtain the benefits of the additional solute and water clearance and recover nutritionally; this permits the patient to tolerate a nephrectomy, if necessary, without risking immediate rejection and the need for transplant nephrectomy while balancing the risks of ongoing immunosuppression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who have a well-defined plan for retransplantation within a year of starting renal replacement therapy, we do not taper immunosuppression, but adjust medications for dialysis and carefully monitor the immunosuppression. An exception is made for patients who have immunosuppression-related complications such as skin cancer.</p><p/><p>Further studies are needed to determine if slower taper of other immunosuppressive agents, such as the calcineurin inhibitors, can reduce the incidence of nephrectomy without untoward side effects in the dialysis population.</p><p>Among those who develop symptoms of allograft rejection with withdrawal, we and others administer a five- to seven-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 0.3 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day; patients are subsequently referred for nephrectomy. By comparison, some nephrologists advocate immediate nephrectomy for those with even mild symptoms of rejection after immunosuppressive agent withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Rejection and transplant nephrectomy after withdrawal'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reasons to withdraw immunosuppressive medications in dialysis patients with a failed renal transplant are the increased risk of infection and malignancy if such agents are continued, the adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy, and that dosing of some immunosuppressive agents is difficult in patients with renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Reasons for withdrawal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The withdrawal of immunosuppression may be associated with significant complications. These include (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Complications of withdrawal'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Precipitation of rejection, possibly requiring transplant nephrectomy often more than a year after withdrawal of immunosuppression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary adrenal insufficiency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of residual renal function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Potentially adverse immunologic effects among those pursuing another transplantation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients on hemodialysis without a prompt plan for permanent venous access should be withdrawn from immunosuppression because of the high risk of catheter-related infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best method for <span class=\"nowrap\">tapering/withdrawing</span> immunosuppression following renal allograft failure is unclear, with most transplant centers having center-specific and patient-specific protocols. Our approach is discussed above.
