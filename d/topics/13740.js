The left subclavian access is particularly well suited for cardiac access, including placement of pulmonary artery catheters, temporary transvenous pacer leads, and implantable pacers and defibrillators.</p><p>Subclavian venous access may be preferred for subcutaneous port placement due to the short distance between the subclavian vein and chest wall, making the catheter less prone to kinking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86790402\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relative contraindications to subclavian venous catheterization include coagulopathy and altered local anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Relative contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Subclavian access should be avoided, if possible, at sites with altered local anatomy (eg, previous clavicle fracture), prior access, or the presence of an indwelling pacemaker or internal defibrillator because these are associated with a higher risk of failure, complication, and malposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>In patients with significant unilateral lung disease, cannulation of the vessel ipsilateral to the compromised lung is preferred to avoid decompensation in the event of a procedure-related pneumothorax. </p><p>The subclavian site should be avoided for large bore hemodialysis catheters due to the risk of venous stenosis that limits outflow for future arteriovenous hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

These catheters do not have the flexibility needed to negotiate the curve from the brachiocephalic vein into the superior vena cava. Perforation of the central veins can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Coagulopathy is a relative contraindication to central cannulation. However, there is little quality evidence to support this preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although significant bleeding is uncommon, the subclavian approach is generally avoided in patients with significant coagulopathy, including therapeutic anticoagulation, if an alternative access point is available. Bleeding from the subclavian vein or inadvertent subclavian artery puncture may go unrecognized and cannot be treated with direct pressure due to the deep location of the vessel beneath the clavicle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86790409\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBCLAVIAN VEIN ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clavicle is the primary surface landmark for subclavian cannulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62106\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62106 \">picture 1</a>). Moving laterally from the suprasternal notch, the bulky sternal head takes an elongated S-shape (a double curve in the horizontal plane); the medial two-thirds are convex anteriorly, and the lateral third is concave anteriorly. The anterior convexity at the junction of the medial and middle thirds is known as the &quot;bend&quot; or &quot;break&quot; in the clavicle, and serves as an important palpable landmark. (See <a href=\"#H58349363\" class=\"local\">'Subclavian vein cannulation'</a> below.)</p><p>The subclavian vein is the direct continuation of the axillary vein beginning at the lateral border of the first rib (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74801 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62106\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62106 \">picture 1</a>). The vein arches cephalad behind the medial clavicle and then slopes caudally to join the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic (innominate) vein posterior to the sternoclavicular joint. The vein is accompanied by the subclavian artery located superior and posterior to the vein, and separated from the vein by the anterior scalene muscle. </p><p>The neck is a complex area with multiple structures traversing the thoracic outlet. Injury is avoided by knowing the location of these structures relative to the subclavian cannulation sites. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lung lies deep and inferior to the medial portion of the subclavian vein. The dome of the left lung often extends above the level of the first rib on the left, but rarely on the right. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phrenic nerve passes inferiorly along the anterior aspect of the anterior scalene muscle and posterior to the origin of the brachiocephalic vein. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The brachial plexus is superior and deep to the medial portion of the subclavian artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left-sided thoracic duct and right-sided lymphatic duct course posterior to the subclavian vein and enter the vessel near the confluence of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85550067\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBCLAVIAN SITE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right-handed operators often prefer right-sided subclavian access procedures. Right subclavian anatomy carries the theoretical advantage of lower risk of complications due to the lower pleural apex and absence of the thoracic duct. However, right-sided subclavian access is associated with higher rates of catheter malposition and vessel trauma compared with left-sided access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A left-sided access may be preferred when immediate cardiac access is needed (eg, temporary transvenous pacer placement, pulmonary artery catheter) since the guidewire and catheter are more easily directed into the superior vena cava and right heart. </p><p>We access ipsilateral to the compromised lung in patients with significant unilateral lung disease to avoid respiratory compromise in the event of a pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"#H86790402\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with prior catheter placement in the subclavian or internal jugular veins, or a history of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, consider ultrasound to assess venous patency prior to attempting subclavian access. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Duplex ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105074744\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General considerations for patient preparation, including catheter and access site selection, monitoring and sedation, measures to control infection, and consent, are discussed elsewhere.

Prefabricated kits containing all necessary materials are available for most devices. Typical supplies are described in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54646 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For nontunneled catheters, the steps for central venous catheterization are detailed in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68138 \">table 3</a>). For tunneled catheters and other devices, the steps are similar except that a sheath is placed over the guidewire and the catheter (or other device such as pacemaker leads, filter) is placed through the sheath, which is then removed. </p><p>Prior to the placement of subclavian venous catheters, assemble the following equipment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound machine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound machine preparation'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile ultrasound transducer gel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous access kit with appropriate venous catheter or sheath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile drapes, gloves, gown, surgical mask, and cap </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical antiseptic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H24969720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Skin antisepsis'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthetic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isotonic saline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heparin to flush the catheter lumens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transparent adhesive dressing, tape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous tubing and connectors (eg, needleless Luer connector, three-way stopcock)</p><p/><p>Proper functioning of any required fluoroscopic equipment should be verified. Fluoroscopy is rarely required for subclavian venous access but is routine when implanting catheters or devices (eg, pacemaker, defibrillator, vena cava filter).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662980363\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For subclavian venous access, a wide skin preparation that includes the neck and chest above the nipple line allows the operator to attempt cannulation at an alternative ipsilateral target (eg, jugular), if the initial site fails. If difficult access is anticipated, the neck and chest can be prepared bilaterally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58338655\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For subclavian venous access, the clinician should position the patient's bed or procedure table at a comfortable height. The position of the operator depends upon the vein cannulation technique chosen. We prefer to stand at the patient's shoulder for infraclavicular access. Standing at the head of the bed is an alternative for the supraclavicular technique. (See <a href=\"#H662981166\" class=\"local\">'Approaches to the subclavian vein'</a> below.)</p><p>Unlike the jugular vein, Trendelenburg positioning does not significantly affect subclavian diameter, but Trendelenburg positioning may help prevent air embolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Most patients can be safely positioned supine or in Trendelenburg position. However, critically ill and obese patients may develop respiratory compromise and close monitoring is required. Successful supraclavicular subclavian cannulation has been performed in upright and prone positions under extenuating circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Some patients may require anesthesia with a controlled airway for safe placement of central venous catheters and devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H386870930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Patient positioning'</a>.)</p><p>Various anatomic studies have shown that the relationship between the subclavian vein and clavicle change with head, arm, and shoulder positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/16,17,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,21-24</a>]. Shoulder elevation shifts the point of intersection of the vein with the clavicle more medially, and the length of overlap is reduced. Thus, to facilitate subclavian cannulation, we place the patient's arms at their sides (adducted) and use a neutral to lower shoulder positioning, which increases the area of contact between the subclavian vein and the undersurface of the clavicle providing a consistent landmark. A shoulder position 5 cm below neutral shoulder position appears to provide maximal amount of overlap and can be facilitated by placing a small sandbag or rolled towel between the scapulae, if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, retraction of the shoulders was shown in one small trial to be unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The natural tendency for the shoulders to assume a cephalad orientation with Trendelenburg position can be countered by gentle caudal traction on the arm performed by a bedside assistant. One small clinical trial demonstrated improved cannulation using caudal arm traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infraclavicular subclavian access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82344 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62106\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62106 \">picture 1</a>), shoulder retraction facilitates needle insertion by reducing the deltoid prominence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and also positions the vein closer to the clavicle for a more consistent landmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. In one small trial, the incidence of catheter misplacement was significantly lower when the arm was abducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Avoid excessive retraction because this reduces the anterior-posterior dimension of the vein, flattening it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Recommendations to turn the head toward the side of the cannulation are based on anatomic studies and reduced catheter malposition in a single pediatric study, but such positioning has had no effect in trials on adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For supraclavicular subclavian access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55896%7EEM%2F81595\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55896 graphicRef81595 \">figure 3A-B</a>), the lateral border of the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is an important landmark. Contralateral rotation of the head away from the site of access provides unobstructed access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58349363\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBCLAVIAN VEIN CANNULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The subclavian vein is generally cannulated using one of three anatomic approaches, with a large bore access needle using landmark techniques. Following cannulation, subclavian catheters are placed using an orderly sequence of steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68138 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85550527\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ultrasound-guided subclavian venous access has been described, landmark techniques remain the standard approach. (See <a href=\"#H1065231805\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound guidance for subclavian access'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85550111\"><span class=\"h3\">General techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although less commonly used compared with internal jugular vein cannulation, a seeker needle may, at times, be useful. Angiocatheters (catheter over a needle) are less commonly used to access the subclavian vein. The general technique for each of these is described below. Isolated arterial needle puncture is one of the most common complications of venous access, but is typically uneventful if recognized prior to vessel dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Confirmation that the access needle is in the vein is essential prior to dilating the vessel. (See <a href=\"#H662985353\" class=\"local\">'Venous confirmation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is a learning curve for central venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Experienced operators enjoy greater success rates with fewer complications. Among both experienced and inexperienced operators, complication rates increase with the number of introducer needle passes, and are significantly higher after two unsuccessful passes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/2,10,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,34</a>]. If two attempts have been made, the needle should be completely removed to reassess surface landmarks and consider a new access site or assistance from a more experienced clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/2,9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85550174\"><span class=\"h4\">Access with introducer needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To access the subclavian vein with the 18 gauge introducer needle:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the introducer needle into the skin and apply continuous negative pressure by pulling back on the plunger of the syringe. Vein penetration will not be recognized unless negative pressure is applied, but only a small amount of continuous negative pressure is needed (approximately 1 cc of a 10-cc syringe) during advancement of the needle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always advance and withdraw the needle in the same vector. Lateral movement of an inserted needle can lacerate vessels and should <strong>not</strong> be done. Prior to any redirection of the needle, it should be withdrawn to the skin surface. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipate that venous backflow into the introducer needle will be sudden, and steady the position of your hand to avoid dislodgement from the vein when this occurs. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to aspirate blood during needle advancement is common. In this circumstance, withdraw the needle slowly while maintaining continuous negative pressure. Venous puncture may only be recognized during needle withdrawal as the compliant vein may not be punctured during initial needle advancement in up to one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Once access is achieved, stabilize the hub of the needle and carefully remove the syringe to avoid dislodging the introducer needle from the vessel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover the hub of the needle between manipulations and coordinate hub exposure with the patient's exhalation to avoid air entry during the subclavian access. Encourage the patient to hum or perform Valsalva maneuvers to augment central venous pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85550181\"><span class=\"h4\">Using a seeker needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although more commonly used for internal jugular vein localization, a small caliber (21- to 22-gauge) exploratory seeker (or finder) needle, 3.5 cm in length, may help locate the subclavian vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55560\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55560 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/9,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36,37</a>]. This technique minimizes injury in the event of inadvertent arterial puncture. However, with the infraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein, the seeker needle may not be long enough to reach the vessel in some patients. </p><p>To use a seeker needle to aid introducer needle placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above for large-bore needle access, insert the seeker needle while applying negative suction on the plunger of the syringe; more suction will be required (approximately 2 to 3 cc of a 10-cc syringe). Steady, unimpeded blood return confirms intraluminal venous placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the needle enters the vein, withdraw the seeker needle, noting the angle and depth needed to reach the vein. Alternatively, remove the syringe leaving the seeker needle in place to anchor the vessel and provide a guide for venous access by the introducer needle. While applying negative pressure to the syringe, advance the introducer needle in the same vector, or alongside the preceding seeker needle, into the vein. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85550188\"><span class=\"h4\">Using an angiocatheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The catheter-over-needle technique uses an 18-gauge plastic angiocatheter mounted over a 20-gauge access needle. It is more commonly used for supraclavicular subclavian vein access compared with the infraclavicular approach. Stable venous access during manometry for venous confirmation prior to guidewire placement is a perceived benefit of the angiocatheter technique. A single randomized trial comparing the traditional introducer needle technique with the catheter-over-needle technique for right infraclavicular subclavian cannulation demonstrated lower complications and improved first pass and overall success with the introducer needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The needle is directed cephalad toward the suprasternal notch to penetrate the vessel at the broad confluence of the great veins. The downside of this method is that medial positioning requires a steep approach beneath the thick medial clavicle and passage through intervening soft tissue including the costoclavicular ligament.</p><p/><p>After the needle has penetrated the skin, the clavicle may be initially contacted. Take care not to push the needle into the periosteum, as bone plug can occlude the lumen of the needle. The needle should be gently &quot;walked&quot; deeper to reach the underside of the clavicle. The needle should remain parallel to the clavicle (in the coronal plane) to allow it to pass cleanly beneath the bone and minimize the risk of pleural puncture. As the needle passes beneath the junction of the middle and medial thirds of clavicle, it should enter the vein. If the first needle pass is unsuccessful, orient the needle more cephalad on subsequent attempts. </p><p>An observational study at a large trauma center evaluated the most common errors during the placement of infraclavicular subclavian venous access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most frequently observed errors during videotaped assessment of venous cannulation in 86 patients included improper or inadequate identification of anatomic landmarks, improper needle insertion site, too shallow a needle trajectory, and insertion of the needle through the periosteum of the clavicle. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58342409\"><span class=\"h4\">Supraclavicular approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The supraclavicular approach aims to puncture the subclavian vein near its junction with the internal jugular vein. The insertion of the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid is the access landmark for this approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55896 \">figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81595\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81595 \">figure 3B</a>). </p><p>The subclavian vein is 1 to 1.5 cm deep to the skin and easily reached using a seeker needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The needle should be inserted 1 cm posterior to the sternocleidomastoid and 1 cm cephalad to the clavicle. The needle is depressed 10 to 15 degrees below the coronal plane and oriented to bisect the angle between the clavicle and the sternocleidomastoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53255\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53255 \">picture 4</a>).

Nevertheless, real-time ultrasound guidance for both infra- and supraclavicular approaches to the subclavian vein have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/35,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42,43</a>]. A 2015 systematic review of 10 randomized trials demonstrated that ultrasound-guided subclavian catheterization reduced overall complications compared with the landmark technique (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.69), but did not alter success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The principles of ultrasound in guiding venous access are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393399\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Subclavian vein'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662985353\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous confirmation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intraluminal position of the needle can be confirmed by observation of the needle entering the vein with ultrasound-guided access coupled with a steady flow of dark blood into the syringe. Bright red and high-pressure pulsatile bleeding are important but imperfect clues to arterial puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], which can occur, although less frequently, with ultrasound-guided access. Moreover, the absence of these signs is not perfectly reliable for excluding inadvertent arterial puncture. Dark, nonpulsatile backflow of blood may be seen with arterial puncture in the face of oxygen desaturation, shock, or needle malposition. If there is any doubt, the needle's location can be confirmed by pressure transduction. As an alternative, a blood gas can be drawn from the accessed venous site and compared with an arterial sample; however, blood gas analysis is more time consuming. </p><p>To transduce the blood pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the needle directly to the pressure tubing system </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, replace the needle over a guidewire with an appropriate length angiocatheter or 18-gauge single-lumen transduction catheter (without any intervening dilation). Connect the transduction catheter to a pressure line and transducer and evaluate the pressure and waveform tracings on the monitor. Typical venous waveforms should be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58343 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a pressure transduction system is not available, attach a short length of saline-filled intravenous tubing to the needle and hold it vertically to measure the pressure, which should approximate anticipated venous pressure and demonstrate respiratory variation. </p><p/><p>Steady, unimpeded blood return confirms intraluminal placement. The hub of the needle should be stabilized, and the syringe carefully removed to avoid dislodgement from the vessel. The needle hub should be covered between manipulations to avoid the entry of air. The patients can be encouraged to hum or perform Valsalva maneuvers to augment central venous pressure, and hub exposure can be coordinated with spontaneous exhalation to avoid aspiration of air.</p><p>If the subclavian artery is inadvertently punctured, the needle can be withdrawn and pressure applied over the site for 5 to 10 minutes. Elevating the ipsilateral arm overhead may help to compress the vein. If subclavian artery catheterization is confirmed, the catheter should be left in place and vascular consultation obtained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662981554\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER PLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most catheters and other central venous devices are placed using the Seldinger method, which refers to the use of a guidewire placed into a vessel to provide a conduit for intravascular device placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Seldinger first described the guidewire technique for arterial cannulation in 1953 and it was subsequently adopted for venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85551502\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidewire handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the subclavian vein has been successfully accessed, a guidewire should be advanced through the needle or angiocatheter. Multiple types of wires are available to assist with venous access procedures. The most commonly used wire for initial subclavian venous access is a flexible J-tip guidewire, favored because it negotiates curvatures and minimizes vessel trauma during passage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82419 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p>The subclavian approach (particularly from the right side) has the highest rate of catheter malposition compared with other access sites (jugular, femoral), which is due to errant positioning of the guidewire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Head position alters the relationship of the subclavian vein and may affect guidewire placement. (See <a href=\"#H58338655\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p>The J-tip guidewire passage is influenced by the needle bevel and J-tip orientation. Orienting of the needle bevel caudally for infraclavicular access and medially for supraclavicular access facilitates guidewire passage from the subclavian vein into the superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similarly, passage of guidewire with the J-tip directed caudally improves correct placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Complaints of facial pain following guidewire placement often indicate passage into the internal jugular vein. Manual occlusion of the ipsilateral jugular vein during guidewire placement may decrease malposition into it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The guidewire should always pass smoothly and easily thorough the needle, dilator, or catheter without resistance. Methods to address resistance to guidewire advancement or withdrawal are discussed below. </p><p>To place the guidewire:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position the tapered plastic introducer to straighten the distal J-tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72306\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72306 \">picture 6</a>). The orientation of the introducer needle bevel tip and the J-tip of the guidewire can help facilitate the direction of wire passage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain the residual length of guidewire (50 cm standard length) under constant manual control to maintain sterility and avoid its loss off the operating field. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the guidewire only as far as needed to allow passage of the catheter over the wire. Guidewires (and catheters) rarely require positioning more than 20 cm deep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/5,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,48</a>]. The atriocaval junction averages 18 cm for right subclavian access, and 21 cm from the left subclavian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These average values vary depending upon stature. In an Asian study, average distances were slightly shorter at 14 cm for the right subclavian vein and 17 cm for the left subclavian vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Advancing the guidewire deeper risks intracardiac or inferior vena cava (IVC) wire placement with the potential for cardiac arrhythmia, perforation, and snaring of other intravascular devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Never forcefully advance the guidewire, as this can kink and permanently deform the wire and risk vessel injury. The guidewire should always pass smoothly and easily thorough the needle, dilator, or catheter without resistance. Resistance to guidewire passage can be due to needle dislodgement, compression of the guidewire against the vessel wall, or anatomic obstruction. Rotating the needle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> guidewire to reorient the bevel or J-tip may relieve impingement of the guidewire on the posterior vessel wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If resistance persists, remove the guidewire and aspirate blood to confirm intraluminal needle position. Reducing the angle of the needle against the skin may facilitate guidewire passage. Once the guidewire is positioned, hold it firmly in place, and remove the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance during guidewire withdrawal can be managed by simultaneous removal of the needle and indwelling wire. Continued resistance may indicate entrapment and warrants diagnostic radiography to evaluate the wire appearance and position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Withdrawing a kinked guidewire through the needle can shear off the wire, allowing it to embolize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86790514\"><span class=\"h2\">Tract dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central venous catheters are substantially larger caliber than the needle and guidewire used for venous access. Dilation of the subcutaneous tissue tract is required for catheter insertion and is accomplished by threading a single stiff tapered dilator or series of dilators over the wire to expand the subcutaneous tissue and vein. The skin and fascia catheter tract should be dilated carefully with gentle pressure. Only the soft tissue and vein wall need to be dilated. Overzealous efforts and guidewire kinking (especially with stiff dilators) risk traumatic vein injury. </p><p>The dilator-sheath combination for large-bore tunneled catheters is stiff, and placement is facilitated with fluoroscopy, which allows imaging of the tip of the dilator and sheath, ensuring that it is placed no further into the vein than is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H105074751\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p>To place the dilator:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the guidewire is in place, making a controlled 3 mm stab incision (#11 blade) in the skin at the guidewire entry site will prevent the dilator from catching. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thread the stiff tapered dilator over the wire, making certain the guidewire does not advance, and is not pulled out at the skin exit site. The guidewire and dilator should <strong>never</strong> be advanced as a single unit, to avoid venous injury. The wire should serve as an immobile monorail over which the dilator (or catheter) is passed. Lateral traction of the skin helps to apply tension and avoid kinking the wire as the dilator traverses tissue planes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the wire just above the dilator hub, grasp the dilator just above its tip and push it over the guidewire with a firm corkscrew motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77656\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77656 \">picture 7</a>). Mild resistance is normal. Excessive resistance may represent an inadequate skin incision, a malpositioned guidewire, or guidewire or dilator deformation. Kinking of the guidewire against the dilator is associated with vessel trauma and puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above with needle placement, the opening of the dilator (or <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> combination) should be covered, and the patient encouraged to Valsalva to prevent entry of air. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the dilator only to the anticipated depth of the subclavian vein, <strong>not</strong> the entire length of the dilator. For the subclavian site, the dilator need only be advanced 3 to 5 cm into the vein depending upon the thickness of the patient's neck. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdraw the dilator while maintaining the guidewire position within the vessel. Apply direct pressure to the exit site to maintain hemostasis prior to catheter insertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steady traction on the skin during soft-tissue dilatation helps prevent wire kinking. Rotating the dilator during advancement often facilitates tract dilatation (round dilators only). If resistance is met, it may be related to a kink in the wire which can be remedied by advancing the wire deeper or withdrawing the kink into the dilator. Overzealous efforts and guidewire kinking (especially with stiff dilators) risk traumatic vein injury.</p><p/><p>Many indwelling tunneled subclavian catheters are placed through a peel-away sheath. To place these devices, a dilator-sheath combination is placed over the wire after the tract has been dilated. The dilator and guidewire are removed, and the catheter is placed through the sheath. Once the catheter is in place, the sheath is peeled away from the catheter and discarded. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662982053\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning the catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the subcutaneous tissues and vein have been dilated, the catheter is placed over the wire and positioned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70002 \">picture 8</a>). </p><p>To place and position the catheter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thread the guidewire back through the end-hole of the catheter until it emerges from the distal port and advance the catheter over the wire into the vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51314 \">picture 9</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to catheter advancement through the soft tissue tract can be overcome by simultaneously advancing the catheter and wire together for the first 2 to 3 cm. Advancing further risks subclavian vein injury if the wire is inadvertently kinked. Withdrawal of the catheter and redilation of the tract is preferred. </p><p/><p>Ideal insertion distance varies by patient size and anatomic site. To minimize intracardiac placement, do not insert catheters more than 20 cm from any upper body access site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/5,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,48</a>]. Initial insertion depth for most adults should be 16 cm for right-sided subclavian catheters and 20 cm for left-sided subclavian vein catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Height-based formulas to determine insertion depth exist, but there are no well-controlled studies supporting their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Rare case reports implicate intracardiac catheter tip placement as a possible cause of cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. </p><p>In contrast to right-sided catheters, catheters inserted from the left negotiate the angulation of the brachiocephalic vein to enter the superior vena cava. For large bore catheters used for hemodialysis or oncology, advancement under fluoroscopic guidance helps minimize the risk of central venous laceration. The risk of complications is related to the angle of catheter impingement on the superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. From the left, catheters positioned above the pericardial reflection often abut the weak lateral wall of the superior vena cava and risk erosion and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. As such, left-sided catheters should be inserted to an appropriate length to lie parallel in the long axis of the superior vena cava. This may require catheter tip placement in the upper right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. It is also important to realize that catheter tips are not fixed and migrate 2 to 3 cm with head and arm movement and change in body position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662982310\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter flushing and fixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the catheter is in place, the proper function of the catheter should be confirmed by aspirating blood and subsequently flushing each port with saline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56646 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/9,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,66</a>]. </p><p>The catheter can be secured into place by suturing (2-0 or 3-0 nylon or silk) it to the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58552\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58552 \">picture 11</a>). If more than 2 cm of catheter remain exposed, it can be sutured to the skin or to a separate catheter anchor that is often included in the catheter kit. A transparent dressing should be placed over the catheter exit site to protect it from contamination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662982527\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMATION OF SUBCLAVIAN CATHETER POSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirmation of subclavian catheter tip location can use one or more of the following methods: chest radiography, fluoroscopy, and transesophageal echocardiography (typically intraoperative setting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/67-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-73</a>]. Chest radiography and fluoroscopy are the most commonly used methods. In general, catheters function well with the tip situated in any major vein. However, suboptimal tip position may be related to delayed complications. </p><p>Following subclavian access, the position and course of the catheter and tip should be confirmed prior to its use. When using fluoroscopy for placement, a routine chest radiograph is unnecessary unless clinical suspicion of <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumothorax/hemothorax</span> is high. If fluoroscopy has not been used, we obtain a postprocedure chest radiograph in non-life-threatening situations. If immediate catheter use is needed, venous positioning (but not tip position) can be confirmed with transduction of the central venous pressure, display of the central venous waveform or via ultrasound. Bedside ultrasound is under investigation as an alternative modality to confirm catheter placement and detect pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The optimal catheter tip position is controversial, and controlled studies are lacking. The distal tip of jugular catheters should lie in the lower superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. To minimize the likelihood of cardiac complications, some guidelines recommend catheter tip position outside the right atrium and above the pericardial reflection. The right superior heart border on chest radiography is not a reliable determinant of right atrial position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The carina and right tracheobronchial angle represent reliable landmarks for the pericardial reflection and right-sided catheters should generally be positioned above this point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>]. </p><p>Malposition is common with subclavian access and is often related to an initially misplaced guidewire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If a catheter is malpositioned within the venous system, it can be used under emergency circumstances, but should be re-positioned as soon as feasible. In contrast, inadvertent placement of a catheter into the subclavian artery mandates surgical consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a subclavian catheter tip is positioned too deeply, it can be repositioned at the bedside using sterile technique.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86790563\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central catheters provide dependable intravenous access and enable hemodynamic monitoring and blood sampling. The subclavian veins are reliable access points for temporary and permanent cannulation, and device introduction. Several anatomical approaches to the subclavian vein are described, and the method should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H86790388\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For subclavian access, the patient is placed supine or in Trendelenburg position with the arms placed to the side (adducted) with a neutral to lower shoulder positioning. The natural tendency for the shoulders to assume a cephalad orientation during Trendelenburg tilt should be countered by gentle caudal arm traction performed by a bedside assistant. (See <a href=\"#H58338655\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left-sided subclavian access is associated with lower rates of catheter malposition and vessel trauma. It is preferred when immediate cardiac access is needed (eg, temporary transvenous pacer and pulmonary artery catheter insertion) since the guidewire and catheter are more easily directed into the superior vena cava and right heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclavian artery puncture during vein localization is not uncommon and can be managed by withdrawing the needle and applying pressure over the site for 5 to 10 minutes. Elevation of the ipsilateral arm overhead may help to compress the vein. If arterial catheterization is confirmed, the catheter should be left in place and a vascular consult obtained. (See <a href=\"#H662985353\" class=\"local\">'Venous confirmation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A postprocedure chest radiograph is typically performed to confirm catheter position and exclude pneumothorax. The distal tip of subclavian catheters should lie in the lower superior vena cava. (See <a href=\"#H662982527\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of subclavian catheter position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a subclavian catheter is placed too deeply, it can be withdrawn at the bedside using sterile techniques. If the catheter is not placed deeply enough or is malpositioned, the catheter should be replaced over a guidewire under sterile conditions. The portion of a catheter left out of the body is unsterile and should never be advanced into the patient. (See <a href=\"#H662982527\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of subclavian catheter position'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ruesch S, Walder B, Tram&egrave;r MR.
