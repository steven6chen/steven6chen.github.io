The initial treatment for this stage of bladder cancer is surgical removal of the tumor through a cystoscope (called transurethral resection of bladder tumor [TURBT]). This is often followed by adjuvant (additional) therapy, which reduces the chances of the cancer recurring. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of these, approximately 20 to 25 percent of initially non-muscle-invasive cancers will progress to invasive types during the person's lifetime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining 30 percent of bladder cancers are muscle invasive and generally require surgery to remove the bladder (cystectomy) and the surrounding organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-treatment-invasive-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer treatment; invasive cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>This article has facts about the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The diagnosis and staging of bladder cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL BLADDER CANCER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common first treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is surgery to remove any abnormal-appearing areas inside the bladder; this is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TURBT is a procedure in which a physician uses a cystoscope to see inside the bladder and remove any abnormal-appearing areas. A cystoscope is a long, thin tube that contains a light and a camera.</p><p>In most cases, this procedure is done in an operating room while the person is under anesthesia. After the procedure, you can usually go home, sometimes with a catheter for a few days.</p><p>In certain cases, usually in people with more aggressive microinvasive cancers, a second TURBT will be performed several weeks after the first to be sure that no tumor was missed during the original cystoscopy. If all tumor has been removed after this second TURBT, you will begin adjuvant therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1658776677\"><span class=\"h1\">BLUE LIGHT (FLUORESCENT) CYSTOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enhanced visualization of tumors and improved removal can be accomplished with the advent of a cystoscopy procedure using blue light together with a dye that is injected into the bladder at least an hour beforehand. This US Food and Drug Association (FDA)-approved dye and procedure is gradually gaining increased acceptance in the United States, although it has been in use in Europe for over a decade. The main advantage of this approach is a decrease in the rate of recurrence due to the detection of tumors that are not seen under standard white light cystoscopy. This also helps define the margins of the bladder tumor for complete removal. Use of blue light cystoscopy results in a 10 to 15 percent absolute decrease in early tumor recurrences.</p><p>A similar technological advance does not require dye at all, but instead, uses filters to block all blue and green light to highlight areas of increased blood vessels, which often feed the tumor. This technique is called narrow band imaging (NBI) and can be done in the office with a flexible cystoscope. While not as rigorously studied as blue light cystoscopy, the results of clinical trials show a similar degree of increased tumor detection when compared with standard white light cystoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT BLADDER CANCER THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even in people who have their bladder tumor completely removed with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), up to 50 percent will have a recurrence of their cancer within 12 months. Because of this high recurrence rate, adjuvant (additional) therapy is usually recommended. The type of adjuvant therapy recommended depends upon your risk of recurrence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people who are at low risk of recurrence will be advised to have a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy at the time of the initial TURBT. This is thought to help prevent floating tumor cells dislodged from the TURBT from seeding and starting new tumors. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Intravesical chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">&quot;Intravesical&quot; means that the treatment is put inside of the bladder, usually through a catheter (a flexible tube passed through the urethra, where urine exits). This allows a high concentration of the treatment to be applied directly to the areas where tumor cells could remain, potentially destroying these cells and preventing them from re-emerging in the bladder and forming new tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people who are at intermediate risk of recurrence will be advised to have either a full six-week course of intravesical chemotherapy, most commonly mitomycin or epirubicin (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Intravesical chemotherapy'</a> below), or intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intravesical BCG'</a> below). Both kinds of therapy usually involve additional booster treatments for up to one year (maintenance therapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People at high risk of recurrence or worsening will be advised to start intravesical BCG, usually within two to six weeks of the first treatment. This is most commonly followed by additional booster treatments (maintenance therapy) once a complete response is obtained. Occasionally, however, patients are advised to consider bladder removal (cystectomy), especially if the disease is extensive.</p><p/><p>The risk of recurrence is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravesical chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy refers to the use of medicines to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells. The most commonly used intravesical chemotherapy for bladder cancer is mitomycin. This is put inside the bladder in one of two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One regimen involves giving the mitomycin once, immediately after TURBT. The solution is left in the bladder for 60 minutes, then allowed to drain out through a catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, the mitomycin can be given on a weekly basis for six weeks. With this regimen, the bladder is filled with mitomycin through a catheter, the solution is left for one to two hours, and then the drug is drained through the catheter. Maintenance treatment may be given once per month for up to one year.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitomycin often causes temporary irritation of the bladder, including the need to urinate frequently and urgently and pain with urination. Mitomycin can also cause a skin rash on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and genitals. If this rash occurs, treatment with mitomycin is stopped and should not be restarted. Occasionally, cortisone therapy is prescribed if the effects are severe and not resolving on their own. A different chemotherapy drug, or even BCG, might be substituted in this situation. Rarely, mitomycin can cause the bladder to shrink down so that it holds less urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravesical BCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BCG is an attenuated live bacterium that causes cow tuberculosis. It is a common treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, particularly for cancers that have a risk of worsening over time. BCG is believed to work by triggering the body's immune system to destroy any cancer cells that remain in the bladder after TURBT.</p><p>BCG is in a liquid solution that is put into the bladder with a catheter. The person then holds the solution in the bladder for two hours before they urinate. The treatment is usually given once per week for six weeks, starting approximately two to three weeks after the last TURBT. Further booster (maintenance) treatments can extend the benefits of BCG. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance BCG'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits of intravesical BCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravesical BCG, in combination with TURBT, is the most effective treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. BCG therapy has been shown to delay tumor growth to a more advanced stage and decrease the need for surgical removal of the bladder at a later time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bladder-cancer-treatment-non-muscle-invasive-superficial-cancer-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects of BCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who are treated with intravesical BCG have some side effects; the most common of these include the need to urinate frequently, pain with urination, fever, blood in the urine, and body aches. These symptoms usually begin within two to four hours of treatment and resolve within 48 hours.</p><p>Anyone who develops a fever (temperature greater than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C) and drenching night sweats 48 hours or more after treatment with BCG should contact their health care provider. These may be signs of less common but more serious side effects, including bodywide infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING AFTER INITIAL BLADDER CANCER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests are usually performed approximately three months after the start of intravesical treatment, or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for those who did not get intravesical therapy, to be sure that the cancer has not recurred. If there are no signs of recurrence, maintenance Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment may be recommended. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance BCG'</a> below.)</p><p>If there are signs of cancer recurrence, any abnormal areas will be biopsied and removed with TURBT. Treatment after TURBT will depend upon the tumor's stage at recurrence and the amount of time that has passed since the first course of BCG was given. In general, there are two options: further treatment with weekly intravesical therapy or surgical removal of the bladder (cystectomy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-treatment-invasive-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer treatment; invasive cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance BCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance intravesical BCG treatment is generally recommended for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). The benefit of maintenance treatment is that it may further delay recurrence and progression of the cancer.</p><p>Although the optimal duration of maintenance treatment is debated, several expert groups recommend that it be given for at least one year. Maintenance BCG is typically given once per week for three weeks at 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial BCG treatment. In some cases, maintenance BCG treatment will be recommended for one year for those at intermediate risk of recurrence and for three years for those at higher risk for recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE AFTER BLADDER CANCER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even in people who are treated appropriately, bladder cancer often recurs. Recurrent cancer can develop anywhere along the urinary tract, including the lining of the kidneys, ureters, prostate, urethra, and bladder. Close follow-up after treatment is required to monitor for recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystoscopy and urine cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeat cystoscopy and urine cytology testing are recommended for surveillance, beginning three months after treatment ends. If there are no signs of recurrence, cystoscopy and urine testing are usually recommended every three to six months for four years, then once per year. Low-risk patients require less frequent cystoscopy and no urine cytology testing.</p><p>If there are signs of recurrent bladder cancer, the next step depends upon several factors, including the person's age and underlying medical problems, the tumor's stage and grade at recurrence, previous treatments used, and the amount of time that has passed since the last course of treatment. In general, the options include a second course of intravesical therapy (repeat Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG], <span class=\"nowrap\">BCG/interferon,</span> valrubicin, or gemcitabine) or surgical removal of the bladder (cystectomy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-treatment-invasive-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer treatment; invasive cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upper urinary tract (eg, kidneys, ureters) is lined with the same cells as the bladder. The tumors that develop in the bladder can develop in the upper urinary tract as well. As a result, an imaging test, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, is recommended before and sometimes after the initial course of treatment. This type of test is usually done every one to two years for patients with higher-risk tumors.</p><p>CT scanning and other types of imaging tests are described separately.
