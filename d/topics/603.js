Penicillins are one group within the family of beta-lactam antibiotics, which also includes cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams. This topic will present diagnostic strategies used by allergy specialists for evaluating a patient with suspected or confirmed immediate (ie, immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated) allergy to penicillins.

However, more than 90 percent of patients with a reported penicillin allergy do not have immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies when skin testing is performed, either because they were inappropriately labeled as allergic or because they had an earlier allergy that resolved with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergy-evaluation-for-immediate-penicillin-allergy-skin-test-based-diagnostic-strategies-and-cross-reactivity-with-other-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Among patients with an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy that has been <strong>confirmed</strong> with skin testing, available studies suggest that 97 percent will tolerate cephalosporins and 99 percent will tolerate carbapenems, as reviewed in detail in this topic. However, despite these reassuring figures, beta-lactam drugs are among the leading causes of drug-induced anaphylaxis, and there are methodologic issues with the data that should be appreciated to understand the limitations of the literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44102614\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONCEPTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205850163\"><span class=\"h2\">Features of immediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate reactions to drugs typically involve flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension, although an array of other symptoms may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>). Signs and symptoms usually begin within minutes to one hour or two of administration, beginning somewhat later for oral compared with intravenous medications. The clinical manifestations of these reactions are reviewed in more detail separately.

Patients have been described who have positive skin tests to the aminopenicillins but have negative skin testing to the penicillin G skin testing reagents, presumably (although not proven) attributable to sensitization to the R-group side chains in the aminopenicillins. These R groups are shared by certain cephalosporins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75589 \">table 2</a>). For example, amoxicillin has an R group that is identical to that in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefadroxil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefadroxil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefprozil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefprozil</a>, and cefatrizine. However, selective allergy to the aminopenicillins is believed to be uncommon in most populations.

Individuals with this syndrome have an increased propensity to react to medications in general, for reasons that are not fully understood.</p><p>In studies of patients with allergies to structurally-related antibiotics, the concept of multiple antibiotic allergy syndrome should be considered as a possible confounding factor that could overestimate cross-reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergy-evaluation-for-immediate-penicillin-allergy-skin-test-based-diagnostic-strategies-and-cross-reactivity-with-other-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Specifically, patients who are allergic to one drug and are challenged with a potentially related drug should theoretically also be challenged with an unrelated antibiotic.

Patients were not challenged to cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains for comparison.

More than 90 percent of patients with a reported penicillin allergy do not have immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies when skin testing is performed, either because they were inappropriately labeled as allergic or because they had an earlier allergy that resolved with time. Even among patients with an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy that has been <strong>confirmed</strong> with skin testing, available studies suggest that 97 percent will tolerate cephalosporins and 99 percent will tolerate carbapenems. Still, beta-lactam reactions can be severe, and the goal of an allergy evaluation is to clarify that individual's specific risk, based upon available data and the details of the patient's past reaction(s). (See <a href=\"#H376978401\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate reactions to drugs typically involve flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension, although an array of other symptoms may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>). Signs and symptoms usually begin within minutes to one hour or two of administration. The allergens that are believed important for these reactions arise from the core beta-lactam ring structure, which is common to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79230 \">figure 1</a>). However, patients may also react selectively to the aminopenicillins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>), although this has largely been described in Spain and may not be a widespread phenomenon.

Demonstrating that the patient has a negative skin test to the desired cephalosporins further increases safety.

Without precautions, some of these reactions could be severe or life-threatening. The patient should either be treated with an unrelated antibiotic or if a cephalosporin is strongly indicated, it should be given by a test dose procedure or by empiric desensitization, depending upon the severity of the previous penicillin reaction and other factors. Demonstrating that the patient has a negative skin test to the desired cephalosporin further increases safety.
