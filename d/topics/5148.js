Failure of any one of these processes results in a congenital anomaly.</p><p>The American Society for Reproductive Medicine classifies female reproductive tract anomalies according to six groups, based upon clinical presentation and prognosis for successful pregnancy upon treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76124 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This classification scheme does not include nonuterine anomalies, but permits additional descriptions of associated vaginal, tubal, and urinary abnormalities.</p><p>Congenital anomalies of the vagina will be reviewed here. Congenital cervical and uterine anomalies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of the female genital tract begins at three weeks of gestation and continues into the second trimester of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonads</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadal development results from migration of primordial germ cells to the genital ridge. At five weeks, the gonads are identical in both sexes and capable of differentiating into either an ovary or testis. The type of gonad that will develop depends upon the chromosomal sex. The first sign of ovarian differentiation is the absence of Sertoli cells at 6 to 7 weeks of gestation; the ovarian primordial follicles are identifiable after 13.5 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The female genital tract is derived from the m&uuml;llerian ducts, urogenital sinus, and vaginal plate. Initially during the indifferent stage, male and female embryos have both mesonephric (wolffian) and paramesonephric (m&uuml;llerian) ducts. The paired mesonephric ducts connect the mesonephric kidneys to the cloaca. At approximately five weeks, the ureteric bud, a dorsal outgrowth of the mesonephric duct, stimulates the differentiation of the metanephros. The metanephros eventually becomes the functional kidney, while the mesonephros degenerates at approximately 10 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal agenesis: Prenatal diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterus and fallopian tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The m&uuml;llerian ducts are first identifiable at approximately six weeks of gestation when they begin to elongate caudally and cross the metanephric ducts medially to meet in the midline. By the seventh week, the urorectal septum has developed and separates the rectum from the urogenital sinus. Around 12 weeks, the caudal portion of the m&uuml;llerian ducts fuse to form the uterovaginal canal, which inserts into the dorsal wall of the urogenital sinus at M&uuml;ller's tubercle. The two m&uuml;llerian ducts are initially composed of solid tissue and lie side by side. Subsequently, internal canalization of each duct produces two channels divided by a septum that is reabsorbed in a cephalad direction by 20 weeks. The cranial, unfused portions of the m&uuml;llerian ducts develop into the fimbria and fallopian tubes, while the caudal, fused portions form the uterus and upper vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54216 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vagina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sinovaginal bulbs are two solid evaginations originating in the urogenital sinus at the distal aspect of the m&uuml;llerian tubercle. The sinovaginal bulbs proliferate into the caudal end of the uterovaginal canal to become a solid vaginal plate. The lumen of the lower vagina is then formed by degeneration of the central cells of this vaginal plate, which occurs in a cephalad direction. Canalization is complete by 20 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hymen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginal lumen is separated from the urogenital sinus by the hymenal membrane. The hymen usually ruptures before birth due to degeneration of the central epithelial cells. However, a thin fold of mucous membrane persists around the vaginal introitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple integrated steps are required for normal development of the female genital tract; several key points are worthy of emphasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of the gonads occurs independent from that of the genital tract; therefore, women with congenital uterovaginal anomalies may have normal ovaries with normal hormonal production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The formation of the reproductive tract is closely associated with the development of the urinary system, thus genital tract anomalies are often associated with anomalies of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruption of normal embryologic processes of the m&uuml;llerian ducts, such as agenesis, failure of lateral fusion, or failure of canalization, result in development of the various congenital anomalies of the female reproductive tract.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ANOMALIES OF THE HYMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hymenal membrane consists of fibrous connective tissue attached to the vaginal wall. Hymenal anomalies are derived from incomplete degeneration of the central portion of the hymen. These anatomic variants include imperforate, microperforate, septate, and cribriform hymens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57977 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imperforate hymen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An imperforate hymen is one of the most common obstructive lesions of the female genital tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78094\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78094 \">picture 1</a>). At birth, infants may have a bulging introitus due to mucocolpos from vaginal secretions stimulated by maternal estradiol. If the diagnosis is not made in the newborn period and the hymen remains imperforate, the mucus will be reabsorbed and the child usually remains asymptomatic until menarche. At that time, the adolescent girl may present with a history of cyclic abdominal or pelvic pain and hematocolpos, which may give the hymenal membrane a bluish discoloration. Marked distension of the vagina may also result in back pain, pain with defecation, or difficulties with urination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repair of the hymen can be performed at any age; however, the repair is facilitated if the tissues have undergone estrogen stimulation. Therefore, surgery is ideal in the newborn, postpubertal, or premenarchal time periods. Surgical repair, performed under anesthesia, consists of an elliptical incision in the membrane close to the hymenal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77857 \">figure 3</a>) followed by evacuation of the obstructed material. Extra-hymenal tissue is excised using electrocautery to create a normal sized orifice and the vaginal mucosa is sutured to the hymenal ring using 3-0 or 4-0 vicryl or chromic suture to prevent adhesion and recurrence of the obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete hymenal fenestration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete fenestration of the hymenal opening [microperforate, septate, or cribiform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57977 \">figure 2</a>)] is often asymptomatic. Patients may seek gynecologic evaluation because of inability to insert tampons, douches, or vaginal creams, or because of difficulty with coitus. In addition, women with microperforate hymens may present with postmenstrual spotting or malodorous discharge due to partial obstruction and poor drainage. If the menstrual products are not fully evacuated from the vagina, the retained blood may become infected and lead to bilateral tuboovarian abscesses.</p><p>Treatment of microperforate, septate, and cribriform hymens involves resection of the excess hymenal tissue to create a functional hymenal ring, as described above. The excess hymenal tissue is excised with the use of electrocautery and interrupted sutures are placed to reapproximate the tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ANOMALIES OF THE VAGINA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Transverse vaginal septum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transverse vaginal septum results when there is failure of fusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> canalization of the urogenital sinus and m&uuml;llerian ducts, which occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 80,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These septa may be located at various levels in the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53442\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53442 \">figure 4</a>); approximately 46 percent are found in the upper vagina, 35 to 40 percent in the middle portion, and 15 to 20 percent in the lower vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The septa are generally less than 1 centimeter in thickness and may have a small central or eccentric perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56204%7EOBGYN%2F80278%7EOBGYN%2F54407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56204 graphicRef80278 graphicRef54407 \">figure 5A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The majority of transverse vaginal septums have a fenestration and are thus not completely obstructed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external genitalia appear normal, but internally the vagina is shortened (a blind pouch if there is obstruction). Children may present with mucocolpos, whereas adolescents can develop hematocolpos (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54683\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54683 \">figure 6</a>) or pyohematocolpos due to an ascending infection through the small perforation. A mass may be palpated above the examining finger on rectoabdominal examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonographic or magnetic resonance imaging helps to define the location and thickness of the septum and to differentiate between a high septum and congenital absence of the cervix.</p><p>A small septum can be resected, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis of the upper and lower vaginal mucosa. A thick septum is more difficult to excise and repair; excision should be attempted only by surgeons experienced with this procedure. Reanastomosis is easier if the upper vagina has been distended with menstrual blood products, as this acts as a natural tissue expander to increase the amount of upper vaginal tissue available for the reanastomosis. In addition, preoperative use of vaginal dilators may thin the septum and facilitate reanastomosis. A Z-plasty technique can be used to prevent circumferential scar formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=z-plasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Z-plasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 36 pregnancies have been reported in women with transverse septa. One-half had planned cesarean delivery, most of the rest had incision or instrumental dilation during labor, and a few underwent incision before pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Outcomes were generally good.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Longitudinal vaginal septum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longitudinal septa are typically associated with uterine anomalies, such as septate uterus and uterus didelphys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The septum that divides the vagina may be partial or complete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient may note difficulty inserting tampons, persistent bleeding despite tampon placement, dyspareunia, or she may be asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation should include imaging of the upper reproductive tract to determine if there is a single uterus or two uterine structures. This can be accomplished with two-dimensional ultrasound, three-dimensional ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment involves complete removal of the septum. Excision is the traditional procedure with care to avoid compromise to the bladder and rectum. The septal tissue should be excised in total as retained fragments of septum may cause dyspareunia. The septal tissue is resected and then the normal vaginal mucosas from each vagina are sutured together over the defect created by the resection. Surgery is not required in asymptomatic women with a longitudinal vaginal septum, but will facilitate vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructed hemi-vagina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An obstructed hemi-vagina can be associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis or renal anomaly (horseshoe kidney, duplication).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient may have pain, pus from microcommunication from the obstructed side to the non-obstructed vagina, and rarely cyclic peritonitis. The diagnosis can be made by history and physical examination, combined with appropriate imaging (typically magnetic resonance imaging); laparoscopy is usually unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with an obstructed hemi-vagina require surgical correction due to pain, increased risk of infection, and retrograde menses. The obstructed vagina is entered, the fluid is drained, and then the vaginal tissue between the two vaginas is resected. Great care is taken to avoid the bladder, rectum and the cervixes. The two cervixes may be at different levels; therefore, the tissue between them should be left in place so as not to compromise their blood supply. The surgery can be performed as a single operation; alternatively, some surgeons prefer to drain the obstructed vagina by the creation of a &quot;window&quot; with a second operation performed at a later time after the inflammation and distention have resolved. We have found that in the vast majority of patients this anomaly can be surgically corrected in one operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal agenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal agenesis, also known as m&uuml;llerian aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, refers to congenital absence of the vagina with variable uterine development. It results from agenesis or hypoplasia of the m&uuml;llerian duct system, although the underlying etiology remains unknown. Animal models have demonstrated that the WNT4 gene suppresses male sexual differentiation and ovarian androgen production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A loss of function mutation in this gene was reported in a 46,XX woman with bilateral ovaries, primary amenorrhea (due to mullerian agenesis), and hyperandrogenemia, suggesting that WNT4 may play a role in normal female sexual development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The most commonly cited incidence for vaginal agenesis is 1 in 5000 (range 1 per 4000 to 10,000 females) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is usually accompanied by cervical and uterine agenesis; however, 7 to 10 percent of women have functional endometrium within either a uterus that is obstructed, but otherwise structurally normal, or a rudimentary uterine horn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69536 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80263\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80263 \">figure 8</a>), while as many as 25 percent have cavitated m&uuml;llerian remnants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In one large series, ovaries were normal in 78 percent of affected patients, 16 percent had extra-pelvic ovaries, and 6 percent had unilateral hypoplastic ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In addition, these girls often exhibit extragenital anomalies. Approximately 25 to 50 percent have urologic anomalies, such as unilateral renal agenesis, pelvic or horseshoe kidneys, or irregularities of the collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], and 10 to 15 percent have skeletal anomalies involving the spine, ribs, and extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]. Other less common anomalies include congenital heart lesions, abnormalities of the hand, deafness, cleft palate, and inguinal or femoral hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p>The genetics of MRKH are not known. Several studies in surrogacy programs have not demonstrated the defect in offspring of women with MRKH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These women have a normal female karyotype with normal ovaries and ovarian function, thus they develop normal secondary sexual characteristics (eg, breast development, axillary hair, and public hair) except menarche does not occur. They often present with primary amenorrhea at 15 to 17 years of age. In fact, vaginal agenesis is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea, after gonadal dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most patients have a rudimentary nonfunctioning uterus, but 2 to 7 percent have a uterus with functioning endometrium and may present with cyclic or chronic abdominopelvic pain secondary to hematocolpos, hematometra, hematosalpinx, or endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On physical examination, the external genitalia are normal. A vaginal dimple or small pouch with a hymenal fringe is usually present, as the vaginal pouch and hymen are both derived from the urogenital sinus, not the m&uuml;llerian duct. Rectoabdominal examination is helpful for determining the presence or absence of midline structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound examination should be performed to assess the kidneys and confirm the presence of ovaries and the absence of a uterus. Urologic abnormalities (eg, pelvic kidney, duplicated ureters, ureteral diverticulum, bladder exstrophy) were noted in 47 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Possible ureteral duplication can be determined by intravenous pyelography, if indicated. MR imaging may be useful for determining whether functional endometrium is present in a normal or rudimentary uterus.</p><p>Differential diagnosis of vaginal agenesis includes androgen insensitivity, low-lying transverse vaginal septum, agenesis of the uterus and vagina. and imperforate hymen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At present, there is no cross specialty (ie, gynecology, pediatric urology, pediatric surgery, plastic surgery) consensus on the ideal method for creation of a functional vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Nonsurgical treatment with self-dilatation recommended as first line for therapy by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This non-surgical option is highly successful with excellent patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A series of 69 patients with vaginal agenesis found that use of vaginal dilation achieved functional success in 88 percent of women at a median of 19 months. Functional success was defined as the ability to have sexual intercourse, vaginal acceptance of the largest dilator without discomfort or a vaginal length of 7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Surgery may be appropriate if nonsurgical therapy fails or, if after extensive counseling, a patient elects a surgical approach. The most commonly performed surgery by gynecologists is the McIndoe vaginoplasty, and data from over 1200 patients show a high success rate (92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Less invasive laparoscopic surgery, as in the Vecchietti procedure, are an option; however, more data about results and long-term complications are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Ultimately, the best surgical option is dependent upon the experience of the attending surgeon and the woman's preference based upon the advantages and disadvantages of each procedure.</p><p>The timing for nonsurgical and surgical creation of a vagina should be individualized to the patient. Treatment involves a combination of psychosocial support and correction of the anatomic abnormality. The psychologic aspects of a new diagnosis of vaginal agenesis can be overwhelming for any woman, especially an adolescent. Strong support and counseling and psychologic preparation before treatment play critical roles in the resolution of this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A normal sex life is possible after creation of a neovagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/26,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33-35</a>]. Although the patient will be unable to carry a pregnancy, her eggs may be harvested for achieving pregnancy with a gestational carrier.</p><p>Appropriate educational materials for the patient are very important.

Graduated hard dilators are placed against the vaginal dimple and pressure is applied to progressively invaginate the mucosa. Initially, the smallest dilator (or a small pediatric blood drawing tube) is pressed firmly against the vaginal dimple daily for at least a half an hour after a warm bath. The adolescent should insert the tube downward and inward in the line of the normal vaginal axis and apply enough pressure to produce mild discomfort, but not pain. The time necessary to create a vagina varies, ranging from four months up to several years, depending upon the patient's compliance. The Ingram modification of the Frank procedure involves the use of a bicycle seat mounted on a stool to create pressure for vaginal dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Alternatively, repetitive coitus can also create a functional vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A review including 334 patients who underwent dilator therapy reported 86 percent were able to achieve satisfactory intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>The major advantage of a nonoperative approach is avoidance of surgery with its potential complications. However, some women feel very uncomfortable with the concept of using dilators and thus prefer surgical management. It is important to emphasize to them that although surgery can rapidly create a neovagina, many of the surgeries require the use of dilators postoperatively to maintain vaginal patency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is an option for women who have been unsuccessful with dilators or who prefer surgery after a thorough discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>McIndoe procedure &ndash; The McIndoe procedure, which is often used by gynecologists, utilizes a split-thickness skin graft from the buttocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Use of artificial skin (Repliform&reg;) has been reported for this procedure, thus eliminating the need for a donor skin graft site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This skin graft is placed over a mold, dermal side out, and sewn together to form a tube with one closed end. A transverse incision is made at the vaginal dimple and a cavity is dissected to the level of the peritoneum. The mold and skin graft are then inserted and the labia minora are secured around the stent to prevent expulsion. The patient must remain on absolute bed rest and a low-residue diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51448 \">table 2</a>) for seven days, after which the stent is removed. Postoperatively, a vaginal dilator must be used continuously for three months and then at night for six additional months to prevent contraction of the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].<br/><br/>Patients must be sufficiently motivated to comply with the strict postoperative regimens necessary to guarantee a successful procedure, thus timing surgery according to the individual's readiness for vaginal manipulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intercourse is critical. Over 80 percent of patients report satisfactory sexual relationships and vaginal intercourse (ie, the functional success rate) after this surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Complications, which occur in 5 to 10 percent of procedures, include graft failure, post-operative hematoma, rectal perforation, and fistula formation. The most important factor associated with a higher complication rate is a history of prior vaginal or perineal surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Williams vaginoplasty &ndash; The Williams vulvovaginoplasty involves the creation of a vaginal pouch. A horseshoe-shaped incision is made on the perineum and full-thickness skin flaps from the labia majora are used to create a kangaroo-like pouch, which is horizontal to the perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A vaginal dilator is then used daily for three to four weeks postoperatively. Although this technique is a simpler alternative to the McIndoe procedure, it is not usually performed as the vaginal pouch is only approximately 4 to 5 cm in length and positioned at an unusual angle for coitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/20,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,45</a>]. Modifications of this procedure that attempt to avoid these problems have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sigmoid vaginoplasty &ndash; Another option is to use a segment of sigmoid colon for vaginoplasty, a procedure performed by many pediatric surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. One end of the resected segment is pulled down to the introitus to form a neovagina, and the other end is closed to create a blind pouch. An end-to-end reanastomosis is performed to recreate a patent gastrointestinal tract. The advantage of this procedure over the McIndoe is that dilators are not needed. The disadvantages are that women complain of chronic vaginal discharge and foul odor. In addition, there is a risk of developing adenocarcinomas in these grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vecchietti or modified Vecchietti procedure &ndash; Classically, the Vecchietti operation was an abdominal procedure performed through a Pfannenstiel skin incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]; however, it has been modified to a laparoscopic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. There is limited data about this relatively new technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In a retrospective case series, at one year postoperatively, 98 percent of patients reported functional success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Vaginoscopic examination of patients up to 12 months after the laparoscopic Vecchietti operation revealed neovaginal mucosae comparable to normal vaginal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p>The procedure involves creation of a neovagina by invagination using an acrylic &quot;olive&quot; that is placed against the vaginal dimple. This olive is attached to a traction device that rests on the abdomen by subperitoneal sutures placed laparoscopically. Sufficient traction is applied to the olive to produce 1.0 to 1.5 cm of invagination per day, thereby creating a neovagina in approximately 7 to 9 days. Once the neovagina has been created, active dilation is required until regular sexual activity is initiated.</p><p>A prospective case series reported that a modification of technique (using blunt vaginoabdominal perforation of the vaginal dimple rather than sharp abdominovaginal dissection or tunneling of the vesicorectal space) and a new traction device significantly decreased operative time, perioperative complications and traction time, with a trend toward improvement in functional results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>One advantage of this technique over the Frank procedure is that uninterrupted traction is applied. In addition, prolonged hospitalization is not necessary as the traction can be completed as an outpatient. One study of 52 women reported 100 percent anatomic success and 98.1 percent functional success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, this is a relatively new technique with limited data available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Davydov procedure &ndash; Another laparoscopic approach is an adaptation of the Davydov procedure. The Davydov technique is a three stage surgery that includes dissection of the rectovesical space, abdominal mobilization of the peritoneum to create the vaginal fornices, and attachment of the peritoneum to the introitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The laparoscopic approach closes the abdominal end of the neovagina with a purse-string suture. In one study, 27 of 324 women who underwent this procedure had laparoscopically-assisted surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The success rates were similar for both the laparoscopically-assisted and traditional approaches; however, the laparoscopically assisted operation resulted in shorter operating times, lower intraoperative complications, shorter hospital stays, and no external scars. Postoperatively, sexual function (composite score for desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, pain) approaches that of matched controls without gynecological disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Agenesis of the lower vagina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absence of the lower vagina occurs as a result of abnormal development of the sinovaginal bulbs and vaginal plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54407 \">figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57905 \">figure 9</a>).

A vaginal dimple may be noted on external inspection. Since these girls have normal cyclic pituitary-ovarian-endometrial function at menarche, the upper vagina will distend with blood products and secretions, which can be palpated as a mass on rectoabdominal examination. Ultrasound and MR imaging may be used to help define the presence of a uterus, cervix, and upper vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment is surgical. The optimal timing of the procedure is when a large hematocolpos is present, as the distention helps to increase the amount of vaginal tissue available for a pull-through procedure.</p><p>Initially, a transverse incision is made where the hymenal ring should be located. The dissection is carried out through the fibrous tissue until the upper vagina is reached and the obstruction can be drained. The vaginal mucosa is then identified and brought down to the introitus, where it is sutured to the hymenal ring. This permits normal sexual and reproductive function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60820\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60820 \">figure 10</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cysts from M&uuml;llerian remnants, epidermal inclusions, or Gartner's duct (wolffian remnant) usually form on the lateral or posterior vaginal walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. A vaginal cyst may present in adolescence because of difficulty inserting a tampon or dyspareunia, but many are asymptomatic. Most can be treated by excision, although it may be safer to simply marsupialize deep cysts to avoid significant bleeding.</p><p>Anterior wall masses may be vaginal wall cysts, but urethral diverticula are more common at this location. Other disorders that should be considered are leiomyoma, ectopic ureter, and vaginal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].
