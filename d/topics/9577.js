A joint protection program for the neck is indicated for patients with a rheumatologic disorder involving the neck to help prevent recurrent sprains and strains that add to inflammation and degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, it is fundamental in preventive joint care.</p><p>The principles and guidelines for joint protection programs for the neck will be reviewed here. An overview of joint protection and the evaluation and treatment of neck pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-joint-protection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of joint protection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-neck-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of neck pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following principles are the foundation of patient education in joint protection and are applicable to joint protection for the neck:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger surface areas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce excess body weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use good posture and body mechanics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simplify work by using efficiency principles: plan, organize, and balance work with rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remain active to maintain and increase strength and range of motion</p><p/><p>These principles are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Joint protection reduces local joint stress and preserves joint integrity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-joint-protection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of joint protection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Correct posture in sitting has been found to significantly reduce muscle activity, particularly in the jaw and posterior neck, compared with forward head positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although these approaches have biologic plausibility, their effectiveness alone in prevention or treatment of work-related symptoms is uncertain. As an example, attention to posture did not produce a significant difference in musculoskeletal symptoms in a prospective trial in which computer users were the subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Benefits of joint protection techniques in patients with neck pain are demonstrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of 421 chronically disabled patients with work-related cervical spine disorders evaluated the effectiveness of ergonomic principles that included a comprehensive functional restoration program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most were able to return to and remain at work, with low rates of recurrent injury or new surgery in the injured area and less use of healthcare resources following the intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ergonomic training together with the use of an arm rest was more effective than instruction in correct posture alone for keyboard and video display users in a study that randomly assigned 182 employees working in a call-center to one of four interventions: ergonomics training only, training plus a trackball, training plus a forearm support, or training plus a trackball and forearm support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ergonomic training plus the use of an armboard significantly reduced the one-year incidence of neck and shoulder disorders compared with ergonomic training alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.97). The use of the armboard also reduced self-reported neck and shoulder pain and right upper extremity pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of an inclined work surface decreased neck symptoms in 75 percent of 215 assembly workers. Tasks included repetitive soldering and screwing of components on a level surface. Introducing the inclined work surface reduced the amount of neck flexion required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Aggravating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggravating factors are those habits and activities that can initiate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuate soft tissue rheumatic pain and disability. Delving into the patient's routine at work, at home, and in sports is the starting point.</p><p>As an example, office work that involves use of a video display terminal (VDT) is associated with a substantial annual incidence of neck pain. One study of those who used a VDT at work found that 34 percent experienced neck pain at some time during the year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other risk factors for neck pain were female sex, mental stress, and lack of exercise.</p><p>Job strain is a subjective measure that increases when job demands are high and when job decision latitude is low. Increased job strain may predispose to neck pain. As an example, a prospective observational study of job strain (determined by questionnaire) among computer users compared pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms at baseline and after six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Self-reported job strain was associated with future musculoskeletal symptoms when compared with those who did not perceive job strain (HR 1.65, 95% CI 0.91-2.99). Among those reporting job strain, computer users in the highest strain-ratio category were at increased risk of neck and shoulder symptoms when compared with those in the lowest strain-ratio category (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.88-2.62). Those with limited previous computer work also had more frequent symptoms.</p><p>Ergonomic deficiencies in computer workstation design and use are common and have a deleterious effect on the user. Examples include use of nonadjustable chairs, sitting in bent and unsupported postures, and use of office tables for siting of computers. Attention to good workplace design helps to reduce posture-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Similar problems, including poor resting posture, the act of lying with the head propped forward on too-high pillows or the arm of a sofa, positions with the arms extended, or improper height of the computer terminal, are present in the home and in the workplace. Prolonged needlework, improper glasses, and improper lighting may contribute to neck pain. Falling asleep while reading and allowing the head to drop forward can also cause symptoms.</p><p>The rapid increase in use of mobile devices, such as touchscreen smartphones and tablet computers, may be associated with neck symptoms. A recent systematic review found a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints among mobile device users, with neck complaints having the highest prevalence rates, ranging from 17.3 to 67.8 percent. Neck flexion appeared to be one of the strongest risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Neck flexion angles have been found to be greater (p&lt;0.05) during text messaging than during other tasks such as web browsing and significantly larger in sitting than in standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The mechanical demand on the neck muscles during seated tasks, such as using a tablet computer, have been shown to be about three to five times that of a neutral neck posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a study of 56 young adults, neck symptoms were more common in the group that sat with the head bent forward and without forearm support. Electromyography (EMG) activity of the trapezius muscles was decreased when the forearms were supported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Awkward postures and sustained positions, such as neck rotation to the left side with the side bending to the right, sustained neck flexion, and sustained upper arm abduction, such as for mirror use, put dental workers at risk for neck injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-neck/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Personality assessment may also be important. The patient who is a compulsive worker with the attitude of &quot;I'm going to finish this job if it kills me&quot; must learn to respect the pain signals, to recognize potentially self-destructive behavior, and to let reason prevail. Telling a patient not to do a task may not be as helpful as guiding the patient to perform the task in a manner that puts less stress on joints.

Principles of joint protection are derived from the application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Principles of joint protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial step in evaluation includes a detailed evaluation of the patient's routine at work, at home, and in sports and other activities. This evaluation should identify aggravating factors, such as habits and activities that have the potential to initiate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuate soft tissue rheumatic pain and disability. Examples of such aggravating factors include use of a video display terminal (VDT), job stress, ergonomic deficiencies in workplace design and use, and insufficient rest or breaks from work. Similar factors can be present in the home and in the workplace. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Aggravating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should limit time on task in one position, whether sitting or standing, to no more than 30 minutes, taking regular breaks from activities in a single body position and performing activities involving movement. Being physically active is associated with control of neck pain. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Time on task'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Role of exercise'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Body mechanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining good posture and alignment of the head, neck, and trunk during rest and activities is important. This should include avoiding stressful head positions, and patients should sleep on the side or the back, while avoiding sleeping with arms above the head. The proper hand-to-eye work or reading distance of 16 to 20 inches should be maintained. Patients should attempt to sit erect when using mobile devices for phone calls, gaming, web browsing, and particularly for texting. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Posture and alignment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efforts to reduce muscle tension and strain include the use of stretching exercises. Although there is conflicting evidence that exercise can prevent neck pain, both isometric strength training and dynamic endurance training have been found to decrease pain and disability in women with chronic neck pain. Additionally, relaxation techniques or a bite spacer can be used to prevent clenching of the jaw, which can cause muscle spasms in the neck. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Reduce muscle tension and force'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Role of exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper body mechanics, including attention to proper lifting and positioning for physically stressful activities, should be maintained in activities at home and in the workplace. Shoulder strengthening and spine extension exercises are also beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Body mechanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adaptive equipment such as eyeglasses appropriate for distance (eg, lenses designed to focus on a video monitor), &quot;hands-free&quot; headsets or a speakerphone for prolonged or frequent telephone use, and inclined surfaces for prolonged close work should be used to limit strain. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adaptive equipment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Sheon RP, Orr PM.
