The diagnosis of DCIS increased dramatically following the introduction of screening mammography, and now comprises approximately 25 percent of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. The goal of therapy for DCIS is to prevent the development of invasive breast cancer. Therapeutic approaches include surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant endocrine therapy.</p><p>The treatment of DCIS will be reviewed here.

BCT consists of lumpectomy (also called breast-conserving surgery, wide excision, or partial mastectomy) followed in most cases by adjuvant radiation. Radiation therapy may be reasonably omitted in a select population of patients with low-risk disease. (See <a href=\"#H562651840\" class=\"local\">'Local treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1987683\" class=\"local\">'Omission of RT for low-risk disease'</a> below.) </p><p>A sentinel lymph node biopsy can be avoided in most women. However, it should be obtained in women with high-risk features for whom resection (mastectomy or BCT) may compromise the ability to perform a future sentinel lymph node biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H825551714\" class=\"local\">'Indications for SLNB'</a> below.)</p><p>BCT is generally preferred as the local treatment, although mastectomy may be an option in some cases. The decision to administer endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent cancers depends upon the choice of local therapy and the tumor hormone receptor status (see <a href=\"#H1988359\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine therapy'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BCT or unilateral mastectomy; <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progesterone</span> receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">(ER/PR)</span> positive &ndash; We offer five years of endocrine therapy for risk reduction, with choice of therapy dependent on the patient&rsquo;s menopausal status. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> is used for premenopausal women.

The best form of local therapy is debated.</p><p>Local treatment for DCIS involves mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy (BCT), which consists of lumpectomy (also called wide excision or partial mastectomy) followed in most cases by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). In some instances, sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605836782\"><span class=\"h2\">Mastectomy versus breast-conserving therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both mastectomy and BCT are reasonable options for most women with DCIS, although not all women will meet the criteria for BCT. A choice between these is a personal one and should be made after discussion between patient and provider. (See <a href=\"#H605837096\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for BCT'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Patients found to have invasive or microinvasive disease at surgery should be managed accordingly.

Postoperative morbidities associated with mastectomy and BCT are discussed in more detail separately.

Negative margins are defined by tumor-filled ducts separated by a measurable distance from the inked surface. We recognize it may not be possible to obtain wide margin widths (ie, 2 mm), particularly with DCIS close to the skin or muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For women who will be treated with postoperative RT, a lesser margin is adequate. If the area of concern is close to the fascia, the dissection should be carried down to and include resection of the pectoral fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H562651869\" class=\"local\">'Margin width'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p/><p>Patients whose disease does not fit the above criteria should proceed with mastectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562651847\"><span class=\"h2\">Mastectomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4012316856\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mastectomy is curative for over 98 percent of patients with DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Disease recurrence is rare after mastectomy (1 to 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20-22</a>]. Post-mastectomy recurrences may be the result of unrecognized invasive carcinoma, inadequate margins, or incomplete removal of breast tissue at the time of mastectomy. (See <a href=\"#H562651869\" class=\"local\">'Margin width'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Women treated with mastectomy are candidates for breast reconstruction; immediate reconstruction is usually preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS may benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H825551714\" class=\"local\">'Indications for SLNB'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with unilateral DCIS are at a modestly increased risk of developing either invasive breast cancer or DCIS in the contralateral breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]. Therefore, some women with DCIS choose contralateral prophylactic mastectomy to prevent a future breast cancer in the contralateral breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], despite a lack of a proven survival benefit. Alternatively, women who have undergone unilateral mastectomy for DCIS may elect to take endocrine therapy as chemoprevention against a future primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast. For women who have undergone bilateral mastectomy, there is no role for adjuvant endocrine therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1988359\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Postmastectomy RT is <strong>not</strong> routinely indicated for DCIS unless extensively positive margins are discovered upon pathologic review of the surgical specimen. (See <a href=\"#H562651869\" class=\"local\">'Margin width'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H825551714\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for SLNB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not indicated for most patients with DCIS, SLNB should be obtained for women undergoing mastectomy for DCIS. (See <a href=\"#H605837096\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for BCT'</a> above.)</p><p>After a total mastectomy, the lymphatic drainage pattern will be permanently altered, making it impossible to accurately perform SLNB at a later date if invasive cancer is found unexpectedly in the mastectomy specimen. Patients who require a mastectomy have a higher likelihood of harboring an invasive cancer compared with women with a smaller focus of disease and therefore should undergo an SLNB at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>By contrast, our practice is not routinely to pursue SLNB in patients who are candidates for BCT who instead opt for mastectomy, given that the likelihood of invasive cancer in such patients is low. We recognize, however, that practice patterns vary, and others may reasonably choose to perform SLNB routinely for all patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562652034\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast-conserving therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BCT for DCIS refers to lumpectomy to remove the tumor with negative surgical margins, generally followed by RT to eradicate any residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,3-8,10,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-8,10,12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14213859\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of BCT for DCIS is complete resection with negative margins in a cosmetically acceptable manner. When DCIS is present on a core biopsy, needle, wire, reflector, or seed localization under mammographic guidance prior to BCT may ensure complete resection. For larger areas of suspicious microcalcifications, bracketing of the area maximizes the likelihood of a complete excision with adequate margins on the first attempt, thereby diminishing the need for re-excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H562651869\" class=\"local\">'Margin width'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients whose disease is associated with suspicious calcifications on preoperative mammography or in whom the adequacy of the margins is in question, a post-excision mammogram should be obtained prior to initiation of radiation. Residual suspicious calcifications warrant a wire-localized approach to re-excision or a boost of radiation to the postsurgical site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1987683\" class=\"local\">'Omission of RT for low-risk disease'</a> below.)</p><p>RT after lumpectomy reduces the risk of local invasive and noninvasive recurrences. As described below, randomized trials have shown that adjuvant RT significantly reduces the risk of in-breast tumor recurrence by 50 percent or greater compared with excision alone. However, treating all women who undergo breast-conserving surgery for DCIS with adjuvant RT may be overtreatment for some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The majority of cases of DCIS do not recur when treated with excision alone, and there may be subgroups of patients with DCIS in whom the risk of local recurrence is so low that RT may be of no benefit. The difficulty, however, is in reliably predicting those patients who would not recur in the absence of RT. (See <a href=\"#H1987683\" class=\"local\">'Omission of RT for low-risk disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1987232\"><span class=\"h4\">Benefits of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT significantly reduces the odds of in-breast recurrence but does not change the odds of distant recurrence or mortality, and therefore should be discussed with each patient carefully. The benefit of RT for DCIS was shown in a 2009 meta-analysis of RT compared with no further treatment following lumpectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Compared with lumpectomy alone, RT resulted in a reduction in the risk of all ipsilateral breast events (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.41-0.58). This translated into a number needed to treat of nine women to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence.</p><p>In addition, the risk reduction for local recurrence associated with RT appears to be long-lasting, though this is not associated with a survival advantage. This was shown in a report of the long-term follow-up of the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project Trial B-17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At 15 years, compared with excision alone, RT resulted in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of ipsilateral invasive recurrence (8.9 versus 19.4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar overall survival (83 versus 84 percent) and cumulative all-cause mortality rate through 15 years (HR for death 1.08, 95% CI 0.79-1.48, 17.1 versus 15.8 percent)</p><p/><p>Similar findings were reported from a large observational study of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database that included over 100,000 patients with DCIS. A subgroup of 60,000 women were treated with BCT, with or without radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Compared with lumpectomy alone, the addition of radiation was associated at 10 years with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence (2.5 versus 4.9 percent in the lumpectomy alone group)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar breast cancer-specific mortality (0.8 versus 0.9 percent, HR 0.86, CI 0.67-1.10).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1987280\"><span class=\"h4\">RT schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in the treatment of invasive breast cancer, the standard of care for patients undergoing BCT is to deliver adjuvant whole-breast RT (WBRT). Conventionally dosed WBRT is delivered to the entire breast in 1.8 to 2 Gy daily fractions over 4.5 to 5 weeks to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy. For women who will undergo adjuvant RT as a component of BCT, an observational study in 1323 women with a median follow-up of 6.6 years suggested that earlier initiation of RT (ie, &le;8 weeks) was associated with a lower incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (ie, &gt;12 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternative approaches, such as the use of rapid fractionation schedules or accelerated partial-breast RT, are under investigation and early results are promising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Additional data from prospective trials are pending. Although some experts have adopted rapid fractionation in selected cases, extrapolating from its acceptance for early-stage invasive disease, these approaches are not considered standard practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In two single-institution trials that enrolled a total of 145 women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for DCIS, patients received accelerated partial-breast RT (41 to 42 Gy delivered over 15 fractions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a combined analysis, the recurrence rate at five years was 4 percent, which was similar to the rate of recurrence following WBRT reported in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-17 trial (range, 3 to 8 percent for non-invasive and invasive recurrences, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

For patients with low-risk disease that has been fully resected with widely negative margins, the absolute reduction of in-breast recurrence may not be large enough to justify the risks associated with RT. In such patients, it is reasonable to omit RT, especially in the setting of comorbidity, advanced age, or patient preference. We have a higher threshold to omit radiation for young women given some data suggesting RT is more likely to benefit these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>While the results from the NSABP B-17 trial described above have been used to argue for RT in all women who undergo lumpectomy for pure DCIS, methodologic issues such as suboptimal pathologic evaluation and uncertainty about the completeness of excision may have led to an overestimation of the benefit of RT in this study. Moreover, RT is expensive, time consuming, and may be accompanied by significant side effects, and so omission for patients likely to derive the least benefit is reasonable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-for-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Since RT reduces the risk of ipsilateral recurrence without changing the risk of developing contralateral disease, omission of RT would be a reasonable approach for patients with an ipsilateral recurrence risk approximately equal to the risk of developing contralateral disease. Among women diagnosed with DCIS, the risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer or DCIS is approximately 3 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. As described below, studies have tried to identify such a low-risk population using histopathologic and gene expression analysis. While it is difficult to identify a clear cut low-risk population, the benefit of RT becomes less clear as the risk of ipsilateral recurrence approaches that of contralateral recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961782\"><span class=\"h4\">Histopathologic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are no strict criteria for &quot;low risk,&quot; our approach has been to define low risk as DCIS that is low- or intermediate-grade, small (&lt;2.5 cm in size), and resected with widely negative margins (&ge;1 cm). (This negative margin cutoff is more conservative than that used in the studies described below.) Omission of RT in such patients is reasonable, although associated with a small risk of ipsilateral recurrence. </p><p>Several studies suggest that clinical pathologic criteria may define a low-risk cohort of patients with DCIS for whom RT may be reasonably omitted given a low risk of recurrence. These studies are summarized below.</p><p>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (E5194) was an observational study that investigated excision without RT in women with low- to intermediate-grade versus high-grade DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Eligible patients had &lt;2.5 cm of low- to intermediate-grade DCIS or &lt;1.0 cm for high-grade DCIS. Margins &ge;3 mm were required and a negative post-excision mammogram was obtained for all participants. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> following excision was allowed but not mandated. With a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the following local recurrent rates (LRR) were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five-year LRR for low- or intermediate-grade DCIS (n = 565) was 6.1 percent (95% CI 4.1-8.2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five-year LRR for high-grade DCIS (n = 105) was 15.3 percent (95% CI 8.2-22.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 12-year LRRs for the low- or intermediate-grade group versus the high-grade group were 14.4 and 24.6 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p>These results suggest that patients with low- to intermediate-grade DCIS may be better candidates for local excision alone than those with high-grade lesions, who have a higher risk of recurrence. However, a 10-year LRR approaching 15 percent in patients with low- or intermediate-grade DCIS may not be low enough to justify the routine omission of post-excision RT even in this patient population. This 10-year rate of LRR occurred despite a median tumor size of only 6 mm.</p><p>The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9804 trial, which was closed early due to low accrual, investigated outcomes of RT omission in the setting of low-risk DCIS, randomizing 636 patients with low-risk disease to either RT or observation after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this study, low risk consisted of low- or intermediate-grade DCIS measuring &lt;2.5 cm with resection to negative margins of &ge;3 mm. Median tumor size was 5 mm. While recurrence rates were decreased with RT, the recurrence rate was also low in the control group. With a median follow-up of seven years, RT resulted in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduced risk of a local recurrence compared with observation (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.47). As noted, however, few women in either group experienced a recurrence during follow-up, with local recurrence rates of 0.9 and 6.7 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2) toxicities (76 versus 30 percent), although the rate of serious toxicities was similar in both arms (4 percent). Of patients treated with RT, grade 1, 2, or 3 late toxicities were seen in 30, 5, and 0.7 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in either disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).</p><p/><p>In 2016, a retrospective study of approximately 32,000 patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who were treated with BCT for DCIS found that adjuvant radiation was associated with improved survival for patients with high nuclear grade, younger age, or larger tumor size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Radiation was not associated with a breast cancer survival benefit when these factors were absent. While this study used cutoffs of &lt;60 for younger age and &gt;1.6 cm for larger tumor size, it is likely that risk occurs on a continuum for these factors.</p><p>Identifying patients who can safely be managed with surgical excision using clinicopathologic data remains a challenge, and some patients may value the reduction in recurrence (DCIS and invasive) enough to warrant pursuing post-excision RT regardless of their risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1987767\"><span class=\"h4\">Gene expression analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene expression analysis such as the Oncotype DX DCIS recurrence score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>] has been studied as a tool for identification of patients for whom post-lumpectomy RT may reasonably be omitted, but data regarding its utility are still preliminary. Although gene expression analyses in DCIS patients are not routine, if a DCIS recurrence score has already been obtained, it should be considered within the context of known prognostic factors (ie, tumor size, grade, and margin width) as well as radiation-related factors (ie, cost, convenience, and possible side effects) in consideration for omission of RT after lumpectomy.</p><p>The DCIS recurrence score utilizes a multigene assay that was prospectively evaluated in 327 patients with DCIS who participated in the above mentioned E5194 trial.

At a median follow-up of 9.4 years, the 10-year rate of developing a local recurrence, stratified by recurrence score, in patients treated with surgery and radiation was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-risk &ndash; 7.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate-risk &ndash; 13.6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk &ndash; 20.5 percent</p><p/><p>Patients with a high-risk DCIS recurrence score had higher rates of local recurrence, and experienced a greater absolute benefit from the addition of RT to surgery relative to those with a low-risk score. Adjusting for propensity score and year of diagnosis in the high-risk group, the 10-year risk of local recurrence was 33 versus 20 percent, without or with radiation, respectively; in the low-risk group, these rates were 16 and 9 percent, respectively.</p><p>These results demonstrate that patients with a low DCIS recurrence score have a lower risk of in-breast recurrence than those with intermediate or high DCIS scores and may derive a lesser benefit from radiation. However, the risk of ipsilateral recurrence in those in the low-risk group who did not undergo radiation therapy was still higher than the expected rate of contralateral breast disease. Further validation of these results is required before the multigene assay can become a part of clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518281102\"><span class=\"h3\">SLNB not routinely indicated with BCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLNB is not indicated for most patients undergoing BCT for DCIS.

The risk of ipsilateral invasive recurrence at 20 years was 5.9 percent, and the risk of contralateral invasive recurrence was 6.2 percent. In this study, predictors of a higher risk of death from breast cancer included young age at diagnosis (before age 35 years, hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.2), high grade (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.38-2.55), and black ethnicity (HR 2.55, 95% CI 2.17-3.01) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104420 \">figure 1</a>).

The goal of therapy for DCIS is to prevent the development of invasive breast cancer. Therapeutic approaches include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and adjuvant endocrine therapy. (See <a href=\"#H562651833\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local therapy for DCIS consists of mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy (BCT). BCT for DCIS includes lumpectomy, generally followed by RT, and results in breast cancer-specific survival rates comparable to mastectomy, although the rate of local recurrence is higher with BCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for BCT include patients with DCIS whose disease is localized to one quadrant and can be resected with negative margins in a cosmetically acceptable manner, taking into account the size of disease relative to the breast size. Re-excision(s), mastectomy, or radiation boost should be performed if close or positive margins are present. (See <a href=\"#H562652034\" class=\"local\">'Breast-conserving therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are candidates for BCT, we suggest<strong> </strong>BCT over mastectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We recommend that most women undergoing BCT receive RT in addition to lumpectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H562652034\" class=\"local\">'Breast-conserving therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with very small foci of low-grade DCIS, breast-conserving surgery only (ie, omission of RT) with widely negative margins (ideally 10 mm) is an option. However, prospective randomized evidence to support the omission of adjuvant radiation is limited, even in selected low-risk cases. (See <a href=\"#H1987160\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with DCIS, we recommend not performing surgical evaluation of the axilla (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). However, we suggest sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients who do not meet criteria for BCT and thus require mastectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H825551714\" class=\"local\">'Indications for SLNB'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery with or without RT, we suggest endocrine therapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For women who opt for treatment, the choice between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> should be individualized based on the side effect profile of each medication, menopausal status, and the preferences of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H562652190\" class=\"local\">'Systemic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, for women who underwent unilateral mastectomy for ER-positive DCIS, we suggest endocrine therapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For these patients, the use of endocrine therapy should be considered &quot;chemoprevention&quot; and not treatment to prevent recurrence for this diagnosis. In other words, it would be given with the intent to prevent a new primary contralateral or ipsilateral breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H562652190\" class=\"local\">'Systemic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> as chemoprevention for women with ER-negative DCIS given that the benefit of endocrine therapy does not reduce the risk of recurrence in this population. Some women may opt to take tamoxifen, however, to decrease the risk of developing a new endocrine receptor-positive DCIS or breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H434848994\" class=\"local\">'Tamoxifen'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment for a patient diagnosed with a recurrence following original treatment for DCIS is based upon whether the disease is purely in situ or has an invasive component, the disease extent, location, prior surgical approach (ie, mastectomy versus lumpectomy), and whether RT or endocrine therapy was previously administered.
