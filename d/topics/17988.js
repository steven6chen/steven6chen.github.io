However, renal artery stenosis is the primary cause of hypertension (ie, renovascular hypertension) only in certain settings. </p><p>In most cases of renal artery stenosis, one kidney is affected, with the main vessels to the second kidney being essentially normal, hence the designation, &quot;unilateral&quot; disease. Individuals with high-grade stenosis to both kidneys, or to a solitary functioning kidney thereby affecting the entire functioning renal mass, are considered to have &quot;bilateral&quot; disease.</p><p>The treatment of unilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis will be reviewed here. Clinical clues suggesting the presence of renovascular hypertension and establishing the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, treatment of bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, issues related to chronic kidney disease associated with atherosclerotic renovascular disease, and diagnosis and treatment of fibromuscular disease are presented in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;, section on 'Clinical clues for renovascular hypertension'</a>.) </p><p>In three prospective treatment trials of patients with renal artery stenosis, the prevalence of unilateral disease (compared with bilateral disease) ranged from 53 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Most patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis can achieve goal blood pressures with antihypertensive drug therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5462401\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major causes of unilateral renal artery stenosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerosis &ndash; Atherosclerosis primarily affects patients over the age of 45 years and usually involves the aortic orifice or the proximal main renal artery. This disorder is particularly common in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] but can occur as a relatively isolated renal lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease resulting from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromuscular dysplasia &ndash; In contrast to atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) most often affects women under the age of 50 years and typically involves the distal main renal artery or the intrarenal branches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical clues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of clinical findings that suggest an increased likelihood of secondary hypertension, some of which specifically suggest the presence of renovascular disease. These findings are used clinically to determine which patients should be evaluated for renovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56130 \">table 1</a>). Some of these clues are relatively specific for the presence of renovascular disease, and some help to identify those patients who are more likely to benefit from intervention. These clinical clues, as well as the indications for testing to establish the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, are presented in detail in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension#H517662\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;, section on 'Indications for testing'</a>.)</p><p>Advances in contrast imaging (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance [MR] angiography) and Doppler ultrasound have led to the identification of renal arterial stenoses as an &quot;incidental finding&quot; more commonly than before [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The absence of clinical clues for renovascular hypertension in such patients substantially reduces the likelihood that the renal artery stenosis is responsible for hypertension, if present, and also reduces the likelihood of benefit from percutaneous or surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension#H16699645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;, section on 'Incidental lesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of unilateral renal artery stenosis is made by imaging studies in patients thought to be at risk. With duplex Doppler ultrasonography, a peak systolic velocity above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> suggests a stenosis of greater than 60 percent, although some studies indicate that a peak systolic velocity above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> represents a hemodynamically important threshold. With computed tomography and MR angiography, a stenosis greater than 75 percent in one or both renal arteries, or a 50 percent stenosis with post-stenotic dilatation, suggests that the lesion may be producing hemodynamically significant reductions in renal blood flow and perfusion pressure. Such patients may therefore have renovascular hypertension. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTOR REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease have a high rate of systemic atherosclerosis and are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. As a result, they are considered to have a coronary artery disease equivalent and should be treated according to current guidelines for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

A meta-analysis of these trials found no benefit from PTRA on mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), major cardiovascular events, or blood pressure control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The largest of the trials was the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial, which included 947 patients (80 percent had unilateral disease) who met the following two criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

All patients were provided an angiotensin receptor blocking agent as part of the trial (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a>). After a median of 3.6 years, the following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revascularization had no additional effect on the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular or renal death, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, a reduction in eGFR by more than 30 percent, or end-stage renal disease) as compared with medical therapy alone (35.1 versus 35.8 percent). Similarly, revascularization had no effect on any of the individual components of the primary outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients assigned revascularization plus medical therapy had a mean systolic blood pressure throughout the trial that was about 2 mmHg lower than those assigned medical therapy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious adverse events associated with revascularization were uncommon. The most frequent serious complication was renal artery dissection, which occurred in 11 revascularized patients (2.2 percent).</p><p/><p>Periprocedural complications associated with PTRA vary. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], for example, procedure-related deaths occurred in 0.7 percent of patients, acute kidney injury occurred in 2.8 percent, and renal artery perforations or dissections also occurred in 2.8 percent. A total of 7.1 percent developed one or more major periprocedural complications, and, as noted above, there was no important clinical benefit from PTRA with or without stenting. </p><p>However, two major criticisms are applicable to each of the eight randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Considerable selection bias</strong> &ndash; For the most part, the patients enrolled in these trials did <strong>not</strong> meet the criteria for selecting patients likely to benefit from intervention (eg, short duration of blood pressure elevation, hypertension resistant to medical therapy, recurrent flash pulmonary edema): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In CORAL, for example, patients who were hospitalized for heart failure within 30 days of screening for the trial were excluded, thereby limiting the number of trial participants with recurrent flash pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the mean number of antihypertensive medications used by CORAL participants at baseline was 2.1, indicating that many had not failed optimal medical therapy. The mortality and event rates in CORAL were also lower than in most previous registries, suggesting that many high-risk patients were not enrolled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In ASTRAL, many patients had stenoses that were probably not clinically significant (50 to 70 percent), and patients were excluded if their primary doctors felt that they &quot;definitely&quot; needed revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Results of the trials differ substantially from observational reports of &quot;high-risk&quot; subsets</strong> &ndash; For the most part, patients selected by their treating clinicians to undergo revascularization have derived greater benefit from revascularization than did patients enrolled in the trials who were randomly assigned to revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>]. This finding may be related to the selection bias associated with each of the trials, as mentioned above. The following examples are illustrative:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a prospective cohort, 467 patients with renal artery stenosis were treated with either revascularization or medical therapy alone according to patient and clinician preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of these, 37 (7.8 percent) had flash pulmonary edema, 116 (24.3 percent) had resistant hypertension, 46 (9.7 percent) had progressive renal insufficiency (defined as a rise in serum creatinine of 20 percent or more or an absolute increase of 1.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [100 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> or more during the preceding six months), and 31 (6.6 percent) had both resistant hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency. Revascularization was independently associated with the following benefits at four years: a significantly lower risk of death in patients with flash pulmonary edema (58 versus 76 percent) and with both resistant hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency (9 versus 65 percent); and a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events among patients with both resistant hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency (27 versus 60 percent). By contrast, revascularization was not associated with such benefits in patients without these risk factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An observational study compared the outcomes of 347 patients with renal artery stenosis treated with medical therapy alone with 89 patients treated with PTRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of these 89 patients, most underwent revascularization because of specific indications (eg, refractory hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, intolerance to angiotensin inhibition), whereas the remainder had PTRA because they were enrolled in a randomized trial. The patients who underwent revascularization had more comorbidity at baseline than patients who received medical therapy alone. Despite this, patients who had revascularization had significantly lower rates of mortality and renal disease progression after multivariable analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another study, 39 patients who underwent PTRA with stent for refractory heart failure were followed for a mean of 21 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After stenting, there were significant declines in blood pressure (from <span class=\"nowrap\">174/85</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">148/72</span> mmHg), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (from 2.9 to 1.6), and number of annual hospitalizations for heart failure (from 2.4 to 0.3 per year).

In general, the most amenable lesions to angioplasty are those producing incomplete occlusion in the main renal artery. Total occlusions and ostial lesions (which also involve the aorta) generally do not respond well to angioplasty alone due to elastic recoil.

Stenting injures the vascular endothelium, which may result in restenosis. Prospective follow-up of patients who have had a stent suggests that restenosis develops in 11 to 39 percent of cases during the first one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/53,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,57-59</a>], although it can develop at any time. Symptomatic stenosis leading to a rise in blood pressure or a fall in GFR are less common and are reported in 10 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Thus, the routine follow-up of patients who have had a renal artery stent should include serial measurements of blood pressure and estimation of GFR. Some experts also suggest a post-stent duplex ultrasound (at two weeks) with repeated examinations on a quarterly basis, although few data are available to support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Patients who develop an increase in pressure or reduced GFR after stenting should undergo duplex ultrasonography to identify restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Retreatment with angioplasty with or without repeat stenting can be attempted, but the restenosis rate after repeat angioplasty is increased.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two major causes of unilateral renal artery stenosis (see <a href=\"#H5462401\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atherosclerosis, which primarily affects patients (particularly men) over the age of 45 years and usually involves the aortic orifice or the proximal main renal artery. This disorder is particularly common in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which most often affects women under the age of 50 years and typically involves the distal main renal artery or the intrarenal branches. Fibromuscular disease is discussed in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of clinical findings that suggest an increased likelihood of secondary hypertension, some of which specifically suggest the presence of renovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56130 \">table 1</a>). These clinical clues, the indications for testing to establish the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, and the imaging studies used to establish the diagnosis are presented in detail in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension#H517662\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;, section on 'Indications for testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension#H543547395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic test options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease have a high rate of systemic atherosclerosis and are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. As a result, they are considered to have a coronary artery disease equivalent and should be treated according to current guidelines for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis who are hypertensive should receive antihypertensive therapy. The data and specific recommendations are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective in patients with renovascular disease; additional medications are frequently required. Potential concerns with the use of medical therapy without revascularization include progression of the stenosis, impaired kidney function with angiotensin inhibition, and long-term ischemic damage of the stenotic kidney. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis who meet one or more of the following four criteria, we suggest revascularization rather than medical therapy alone; revascularization is usually achieved by percutaneous angioplasty with stenting (or surgical revascularization in patients with complex anatomic lesions) (see <a href=\"#H5462771\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization versus medical therapy alone'</a> above) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A short duration of blood pressure elevation prior to the diagnosis of renovascular disease, since this is the strongest clinical predictor of a fall in blood pressure after renal revascularization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure of optimal medical therapy to control the blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intolerance to optimal medical therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent flash pulmonary edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> refractory heart failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis who do not meet one of the four criteria just listed, we suggest <strong>not</strong> revascularizing and instead treating with medical therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5462771\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization versus medical therapy alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) for treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, we suggest stent placement unless the anatomy precludes stenting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who have an indication for renal artery revascularization, surgery is only preferred for selected patients who have complex anatomic lesions (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple small renal arteries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early primary branching of the main renal artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Requirement for aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries for other indications, such as aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In order to avoid manipulation of a highly diseased aorta or failed endovascular stents (using specific surgical techniques, including splenorenal, ileorenal, or hepatorenal bypass procedures)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Safian RD, Textor SC.
