Histoplasmosis and its causative agent, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, are found worldwide but particularly in North and Central America. Within the United States, infection is most common in the midwestern states located in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Among the endemic mycoses, it is the most common cause for hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of the various histoplasmosis pulmonary syndromes will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis and clinical features of these syndromes and issues regarding histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SUSPECT HISTOPLASMOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary histoplasmosis should be considered in patients with the following clinical presentations, particularly in the appropriate epidemiologic setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia with mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mediastinal or hilar masses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary nodule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cavitary lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericarditis with mediastinal lymphadenopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary manifestations with arthritis or arthralgia plus erythema nodosum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia caused by esophageal narrowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior vena cava syndrome or obstruction of other mediastinal structures</p><p/><p>These manifestations place pulmonary histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Failure to exclude histoplasmosis in the evaluation of sarcoidosis may lead to marked disease exacerbation if immunosuppressive therapy is initiated in a patient who actually has acute histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly, failure to consider histoplasmosis in patients under evaluation for malignancy may lead to unnecessary surgical evaluation. Thus, in the appropriate epidemiologic setting, testing for histoplasmosis should be included for patients who are under evaluation for these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from sarcoidosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathology using stains for fungi, cultures, antigen detection, and serologic tests for <em>Histoplasma</em>-specific antibodies can all help make the diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The characteristics of these tests vary in the different histoplasmosis syndromes, but all can serve as the basis for diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical findings. Each test has certain limitations that must be recognized if it is to be used correctly. The materials for histoplasmin skin testing are no longer available.</p><p>A general description of the various diagnostic methods for histoplasmosis follows. Decision-making regarding the use of individual assays within the context of varying clinical presentations is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Selection of diagnostic tests for different pulmonary syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology and cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morphologic findings in biopsy specimens include granulomas (in most cases), lymphohistiocytic aggregates, and diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74406\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74406 \">picture 1</a>). Histopathologic examination of lung or mediastinal lymph node tissue using special stains that highlight fungi permits rapid diagnosis of histoplasmosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65482 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity is decreased if pathologists are inexperienced in the recognition of <em>H. capsulatum</em>.</p><p>Yeast-phase organisms of <em>H. capsulatum</em> are ovoid in shape, measure 2 to 4 micron in diameter, and demonstrate narrow-based budding. Care must be taken in interpretation of fungal stains because <em>Candida glabrata</em>, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>, and staining artifacts may be misidentified as <em>H. capsulatum</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fungal cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures are most useful in patients with chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Submission of multiple sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage cultures produces a positive yield in the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, the sensitivity of respiratory cultures is much lower in localized disease or acute disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In addition to the low sensitivity of culture, the organism may not grow in culture for as long as six weeks; this delay in diagnosis may compromise care in a patient who is severely ill.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of antigen using the <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen detection enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in the urine, blood, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infected patients provides rapid diagnostic information and is particularly useful in patients who are severely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most studies have been performed using a commercial test that is currently available in the United States. In these studies, an <em>H. capsulatum</em> galactomannan can be detected in 60 to 83 percent of patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, depending on the extent of the lung involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. The highest sensitivity is obtained by testing both urine and serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other tests have been developed using different antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>].</p><p>One study evaluated the utility of the <em>Histoplasma </em>antigen EIA on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the diagnosis of patients with pulmonary histoplasmosis, most of whom were immunocompromised and had diffuse disease; 29 of 31 patients with pulmonary histoplasmosis (94 percent) had positive antigen testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Cross-reactions can be seen in patients with blastomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], coccidioidomycosis, penicilliosis (due to <em>Talaromyces marneffei</em>), paracoccidioidomycosis, and African histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and also rarely in aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but not in patients infected with <em>Candida</em> or <em>Cryptococcus </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p><strong>Please note that one of the authors (JW) is owner and Director of MiraVista Diagnostics, one of several companies that performs the </strong><strong><em>Histoplasma</em></strong><strong> antigen EIA.</strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing is useful in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in the patient with a compatible clinical presentation and epidemiologic risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56766 \">figure 1</a>). Less than 1 percent of residents in endemic areas are seropositive by the immunodiffusion test and less than five percent have positive complement fixation assays; thus, background seropositivity is not a major limitation to serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It should be noted that antibody assays may be falsely negative in immunosuppressed patients. In acute cases, antibodies usually appear during the second month after exposure and may thus be negative when first measured. Antibodies can remain positive for several years and thus may not indicate disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Serology has also proven useful to differentiate histoplasmosis and malignancy in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison of serologic methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complement fixation test using antigens from the yeast and mycelial forms of <em>H. capsulatum</em> is slightly more sensitive than the immunodiffusion test. As an example, serologic study of 276 patients during an urban outbreak of histoplasmosis found that complement fixation had a sensitivity of almost 95 percent versus 90 percent with immunodiffusion testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Complement fixation titers of 1:32 or higher are highly suggestive of acute infection, but titers of 1:8 or 1:16 should not be disregarded because titers in this range occur in about one-third of cases with active disease.</p><p>However, the immunodiffusion test has greater specificity than the complement fixation test. Positive results with the complement fixation test may represent a persistent antibody response from a previous episode of histoplasmosis or infection with other fungi (eg, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis). Positive results may also occur in patients with other granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis); the cause of this is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of note is that active histoplasmosis should be excluded before making a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and should be considered in patients presumed to have tuberculosis in which mycobacterial cultures and stains are negative. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from sarcoidosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In the immunodiffusion test, results are reported as M or H precipitins or bands. Most patients will develop an M band; the H precipitin band is detectable in fewer than 20 percent of cases. The H band is seen most often in patients who have disseminated infection, chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis, or more severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis and is helpful for diagnosis when present. The M band becomes positive sooner than the H band and persists longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Although some laboratories use an enzyme immunoassay as a screening serology for histoplasmosis, the commercial enzyme immunoassay methods that are generally available have not been found to be as sensitive as the complement fixation test, and may be falsely negative in patients with histoplasmosis. Furthermore, background seropositivity and cross reactivity in other endemic mycoses may be higher using enzyme immunoassay methods. However, in one study, an enzyme immunoassay combining antigen and antibody appeared to be more sensitive than immunodiffusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement fixation in patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].<strong> Please note that one of the authors (LJW) is owner and Director of MiraVista Diagnostics, a reference laboratory that is developing the new antibody enzyme immunoassay and performs </strong><strong><em>Histoplasma</em></strong><strong> antibody testing.</strong></p><p>In summary, positive serologic assays must be interpreted with caution in individuals who do not have clinical features that are suggestive of histoplasmosis. If the history is equivocal, documentation of infection with <em>H. capsulatum</em> by staining, culture, or antigen detection is highly desirable. On the other hand, serologic tests are often negative in immunosuppressed patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352373898\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of histoplasmosis is uncertain. One study of a small number of tissue and respiratory samples found that 11 of 15 (73 percent) of culture-positive samples were positive by PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another report, PCR was positive only if organisms were seen by microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other studies noted a sensitivity of 8 percent of urine and 22 percent of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens that were positive for <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen, whereas results in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were uniformly negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/8,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinction from sarcoidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical and radiographic findings in pulmonary histoplasmosis and sarcoidosis may be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A mistake in diagnosis can be disastrous if the patient is treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although such patients may appear to improve transiently, they eventually experience progressive disseminated disease, which may result in increased morbidity and mortality if the true diagnosis is not identified. If there is a high suspicion for histoplasmosis (eg, a patient who has resided in an endemic area with clinical features that are suggestive of histoplasmosis), a tissue diagnosis should be pursued before initiating glucocorticoids, especially if the <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen test on urine and serum is negative. If initial antibody tests are negative, repeat testing is recommended before initiating glucocorticoid treatment, since seroconversion may occur. Antigen testing should be repeated following initiation of glucocorticoid therapy because progressive dissemination may occur if the patient has histoplasmosis rather than sarcoidosis. If bronchoscopy is performed, bronchoalveolar fluid also should be tested for antigen. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Antigen detection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Initial therapy with glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, histoplasmosis must be excluded before treating patients with presumed sarcoidosis with immunosuppressive medications, particularly in endemic areas. The evaluation should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antigen testing of urine, serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungal culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or other respiratory secretions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytology or histopathology of respiratory specimens or lung tissue examined by an experienced pathologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibody testing of serum by immunodiffusion and complement fixation. A newly developed enzyme immunoassay may also prove useful for detection of antibody, but there are few data on this assay at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Positive results suggesting active histoplasmosis would preclude immunosuppressive therapy, but negative results would not entirely exclude histoplasmosis. In such patients, the response to immunosuppressive therapy must be carefully monitored, including repeat antigen and antibody testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIFFERENT PULMONARY SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The yield of the diagnostic modalities differs depending upon the extent of the infection and timing following exposure. A battery of tests is required to achieve the highest sensitivity for diagnosis. Antigen tests and serology may be negative when first performed, but become positive later as the illness progresses. Thus, follow-up testing is encouraged in a patient with progressive illness if the first tests are negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute diffuse pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fungal burden is often high in patients with diffuse infiltrates presenting within a month following exposure to a high inoculum of conidia. In such cases, antigen and antibody testing provide the highest sensitivity. Antibodies may be negative initially but positive a month later.</p><p>Bronchoscopy or lung biopsy may be needed to establish the diagnosis in some cases when less invasive testing is not diagnostic or the illness is too severe to wait for results of antigen or antibody test. In such cases, pathology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture are positive in about 40 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute localized pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fungal burden is generally lower in patients presenting with symptoms of more than one month in duration accompanied by localized pulmonary infiltrates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and usually without a recognized exposure. Antigen may be detected in the urine or serum in only 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cultures and pathology of respiratory specimens or lung may be positive in some cases. Antigen testing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may improve the sensitivity over culture alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Serological tests for antibodies are positive in over 90 percent of cases if both the immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests are performed </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serology is positive in most cases, and the complement fixation titers are often high. Most patients are able to expectorate sputum, but some may require bronchoscopy to obtain adequate specimens. If sputum cannot be obtained, cultures are negative, complement fixation titers are low (1:8 or 1:16), or if another diagnosis is suspected (eg, lung cancer or mycobacterial infection), bronchoscopy should be performed. Cultures of sputum or bronchoscopy specimens have been reported to be positive in 65 to 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Antigen was detected in the urine in seven of eight of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and, in bronchoscopy specimens, in five other patients who had negative antigen results in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Lung biopsy is rarely needed and should be avoided in this population with obstructive lung disease because of the risk for surgical complications, including pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula as well as bacterial superinfection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediastinal syndromes, broncholithiasis, and lung nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few, if any, viable organisms persist in the tissues of patients with these manifestations of histoplasmosis, which represent complications of or expected sequelae of the healing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, cultures and antigen tests are usually negative, even though stains for fungi on the tissues may show organisms consistent with <em>H. capsulatum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a review of fibrosing mediastinitis, evidence for prior infection with <em>H. capsulatum</em> was obtained by positive antibody tests in 17 of 58 (29 percent) patients who had these assays performed, and organisms compatible with <em>H. capsulatum</em> were seen in 11 of 43 (26 percent) biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Tests for antigen are expected to be negative in most cases.</p><p>Organisms can often be seen in pulmonary nodules, but cultures and test for antigens are negative, and antibodies may be detected in low titers of 1:8 or 1:16 by complement fixation in some cases. </p><p>The main indication for surgery in these situations is to exclude malignancy in patients with noncalcified pulmonary nodules or mediastinal lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In patients without risk factors for malignancy, follow-up with computed tomography (CT) scan at three to six month intervals for one to two years is a reasonable approach.

Surgery should rarely be required for diagnosis of fibrosing mediastinitis because the clinical syndrome is unique and surgery may cause serious and avoidable complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
