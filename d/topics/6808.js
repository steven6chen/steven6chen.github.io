Untreated OSA is associated with learning and behavioral problems, cardiovascular complications, and impaired growth (including failure to thrive [FTT]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Early diagnosis and treatment of OSA may decrease morbidity.

It can occur at any age and may be most common in those between two and six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity are the major risk factors for OSA in otherwise healthy children. The contribution of each of these risk factors varies among individuals and also tends to vary with age: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1328731365\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenotonsillar hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a widely recognized risk factor for OSA in children. The size and location of the tonsils and adenoids are influenced by genetic factors, infection, and inflammation. Although tonsils that appear large on anterior oral exam may contribute to a reduction in the airway size, there is not a clear linear correlation of increased size of tonsils and adenoids with greater severity of OSA. Thus, even &quot;small&quot; tonsils (eg, within the tonsillar pillars graded as a 1+ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103834 \">figure 1</a>)) may be clinically significant and cause obstruction in the airway during sleep. Adenoids are best visualized by nasal endoscopy and can also contribute to reduction of the airway size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms and predisposing factors for sleep-related breathing disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Enlarged tonsils and adenoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633553635\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity is an important risk factor for OSA at all ages but is particularly prominent among adolescents. In a prospective study, OSA was diagnosed in 4 percent of adolescents (16 to 19 years of age) and most of them had not had OSA or habitual snoring during mid-childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The strongest risk factors for OSA during adolescence were obesity, male sex, and a history of adenotonsillectomy. The importance of obesity as a predictor of OSA during adolescence is underscored by a separate study of 37 adolescents with moderate to severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;97<sup>th</sup> percentile), among whom 45 percent had OSA on polysomnogram (defined as apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;1.5 in this study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, a history of snoring is insufficient for the diagnosis because many children who snore do not have OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/3,5,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,23,24</a>]; habitual snoring in the absence of OSA (known as primary snoring) occurs in 3 to 12 percent of the general pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-28</a>] and may still have adverse health consequences. Conversely, the absence of snoring is insufficient to exclude OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>Other nocturnal symptoms include mouth breathing, noisy breathing, pauses in breathing, coughing or choking in sleep, restless sleep, and nighttime sweating. Also common but less well-recognized symptoms are nocturnal enuresis and parasomnias such as sleepwalking and sleep terrors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nocturnal enuresis in children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H744308135\"><span class=\"h2\">Daytime symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daytime sleepiness may be less obvious in children than in adults but may manifest as age-inappropriate daytime napping, complaints of sleepiness, or falling asleep during school, short car rides, or on the school bus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/24,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31,32</a>]. Importantly, OSA is associated with inattention, learning problems, and behavioral problems (eg, hyperactivity, impulsivity, rebelliousness, and aggression), sometimes leading to a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,29,33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,29,33-39</a>].

Some children will have irritable mood or difficulty controlling emotions due to disrupted sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children#H16053990\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a>.) </p><p>Mouth breathing or hyponasal speech are common in children with OSA due to the association with adenoidal hypertrophy.

The poor growth is due in part to the increased energy expenditure that is necessary to meet the demands of an elevated work of breathing during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition, nocturnal growth hormone secretion may be decreased in children with increased upper airway resistance during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although reported in early literature, FTT is seldom seen now, perhaps because children are more often diagnosed with OSA before the condition becomes severe enough to cause FTT.

Only limited data exist to suggest an association between OSA and pulmonary hypertension in children, in contrast with adults, and symptomatic pulmonary hypertension is rare. The clinical findings and mechanisms for these cardiopulmonary effects are discussed separately.

Any child who snores on most or all nights or has other symptoms of OSA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111055 \">table 1</a>), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other behavioral symptoms, should undergo a diagnostic evaluation, as outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H934949135\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p>Children with a history of treated OSA should also be followed closely for the possibility of recurrence.

Obesity is an important risk factor for OSA. Paradoxically, poor growth can be a sign of chronic severe OSA, particularly in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/49,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,65</a>]. Either of these findings in a child with OSA symptoms warrants a full evaluation.

Mouth breathing, long (&quot;adenoidal&quot;) facies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66393 \">picture 1</a>), decreased nasal airflow, or hyponasal speech are consistent with adenoidal hypertrophy, which can contribute to OSA. Mucosal or turbinate swelling suggests chronic nasal congestion, which may be allergic, particularly if it is accompanied by other allergic manifestations, such as dark circles under the eyes, swollen eyes, or a transverse nasal crease. Also evaluate for obstructive septal deformity or intranasal mass. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mouth</strong> &ndash; A high-arched and narrow hard palate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72817 \">picture 2</a>), a crossbite, overlapping incisors, and a significant overbite suggest a small jaw, which may be due to abnormal maxillomandibular development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Macroglossia may also reduce flow through the upper airway. Poor pharyngeal or laryngeal tone raises the possibility of neuromotor disease (eg, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy). The examiner should note tonsil size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103834 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64546\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64546 \">picture 3</a>), and Mallampati classification or Friedman score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>], to describe the degree of oropharyngeal crowding. Additionally, the clinician should note information regarding jaw structure, including overjet, overbite, and molar occlusion classification (if molars have grown in). There is no linear correlation of tonsil size and severity of OSA. Often, further information regarding obstruction is obtained during direct laryngoscopy performed by an otolaryngologist and may inform the choice of treatment.

The decision to order PSG is influenced by several factors, including the evaluating clinician, parent preference, age of child, child's medical comorbidities, child's tolerance of sensors, availability and accessibility of testing, etc. We suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard risk &ndash; For children with clinically suspected OSA and without the high-risk characteristics described below, the child should be offered referral for PSG <strong>or</strong> referral first to a sleep medicine physician or otolaryngologist experienced in evaluation and management of sleep-disordered breathing in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk &ndash; For children with obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, or other underlying conditions that affect the airway, we recommend referral to a sleep medicine physician experienced in pediatric sleep medicine. In these cases, a PSG is also needed to establish a firm diagnosis of OSA and evaluate its severity before making management decisions and for post-surgical planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,14,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,71</a>].</p><p/><p>In many settings, the PSG is arranged after referral to a specialist in otorhinolaryngology or sleep medicine. Alternatively, the primary care clinician may choose to arrange for a PSG if a facility with experience in pediatric PSG is available. The child should be referred to a sleep medicine physician or otolaryngologist if the PSG shows sleep-disordered breathing, or if there are persistent sleep problems even if the PSG is normal or detects only primary snoring. The sleep medicine physician can evaluate and treat several other sleep disorders that may account for sleep disruption. Moreover, in some cases primary snoring may contribute to sleep disruption and daytime dysfunction; this issue is the focus of an ongoing study of adenotonsillectomy for children with primary snoring (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02562040&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPM36GON4LCRXnMP9A2K7Gln0LggFTH0snHPhAqZNBsZ3g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6363\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02562040</a>).

Sedatives and sleep deprivation prior to PSG are not recommended because both may increase upper airway resistance and confound the assessment of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. In most cases, children can continue to take their usual medications. One night of PSG is the gold standard for diagnosis of OSA and is usually sufficient based on reported night-to-night variability in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,74,75</a>].

One difference is that the adult scoring criteria stipulate that obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort-related arousals must last at least 10 seconds to be scored, whereas the pediatric scoring criteria stipulate that they must last for &ge;2 breath cycles (which may be shorter than 10 seconds, especially in infants and young children). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apneas &ndash; &ge;90 percent decrease in airflow signal; apneas are further characterized as obstructive (most common), central, or mixed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypopneas &ndash; &ge;30 percent decrease in airflow signal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA) &ndash; Arousal preceded by evidence of airway obstruction that is, however, insufficient to qualify as an apnea or hypopnea (eg, increasing thoracic or abdominal excursion without increased airflow, flattening of the inspiratory portion of the nasal pressure waveform, or crescendo snoring, or an elevation in the end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub>).

These events and summary measures are similar to those used in adults and are described in detail separately.

Diagnostic tests other than PSG have been evaluated. All of these alternative tests have a low negative predictive value, indicating that a negative result is <strong>not</strong> sufficient to exclude OSA, and the tests should not be used in routine practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,61</a>]. However, these tests may be useful in selected cases if PSG is not available. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Home sleep apnea tests</strong> &ndash; Home sleep apnea tests (HSAT, previously called portable monitoring or out-of-center sleep testing) are considered acceptable options for diagnosis of OSA in adults under some circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. However, home sleep apnea tests are not recommended for diagnosis of OSA in children, as explained in a position paper from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After a literature review, the task force found insufficient evidence to support use of HSAT in children to diagnose OSA. The main concern is that use of HSAT may lead to underestimation of OSA presence and severity in children, primarily because most HSAT devices measure fewer physiologic variables than PSG (eg absence of capnography and identification of arousals). &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of HSATs in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nap PSG</strong> &ndash; Nap PSG is an abbreviated study that records sleep and breathing in the sleep laboratory during the daytime. This type of study is limited by the short recording time and the possible absence of REM sleep. Nap PSG has a good positive predictive value (77 to 100 percent) but a poor negative predictive value (17 to 49 percent) for identifying OSA in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. As a result, a nap study indicating that a child does not have OSA is insufficient to exclude OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This type of testing is often reserved for infants or younger children who regularly take naps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overnight continuous pulse oximetry</strong> &ndash; Overnight continuous pulse oximetry that monitors pulse rate, pulse amplitude, and oxyhemoglobin saturation can identify OSA in some children by detecting clusters of desaturation events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. In one study, pulse oximetry detected OSA with a positive predictive value of 97 percent and a negative predictive value of 53 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Audiotapes and videotapes</strong> &ndash; Audiotapes identify OSA with a positive predictive value of 50 to 75 percent and a negative predictive value of 73 to 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Videotapes identify OSA with a positive predictive value of 83 percent and a negative predictive value of 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several questionnaires have been developed to assess symptoms or signs associated with OSA. In general, these were designed for use in clinical research. However, anecdotally they are used for clinical screening or assessment in some settings and especially in world regions where access to laboratory-based PSG is limited. We favor using a detailed clinical history and physical exam rather than questionnaires to guide diagnosis for individual patients and treatment decisions such as adenotonsillectomy or watchful waiting. </p><p>One of the best validated questionnaires is the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder (SRBD) scale from the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ). The SRBD scale can be obtained and licensed at no charge through the following <a href=\"http://inventions.umich.edu/technologies/3773_sleep-related-breathing-disorder-scale-srbd-scale-from-pediatric-sleep-questionnaire-to-identify-symptoms-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children&amp;token=uFpH2PxT+st1baH/ahXuk6deI+FuuheI8vNFb+E1C2Ml3IOwtMcyhQh2Pevnr3d18L5/N34yeAvCurPgjHuzhBpwsx6DAblDsgkXsw/jQMB7cwQag6FozytRZayFOp6IvAUx5aOtY204VPqRoWtKetbtg74bpywn5soWJ31hw+8CK8ocL/WK0HBHl5CpGx/L&amp;TOPIC_ID=6363\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">link</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The SRBD scale predicts PSG results to an extent that is useful for clinical research. The SRBD scale cannot replace PSG in identification of pediatric OSA, but the scale may have utility in some clinical settings. For example, in contrast with PSG, the SRBD generates a score that correlates with OSA-related impairment of behavior, quality of life, and sleepiness, and helps to predict improvement in these morbidities after adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The SRBD scale was originally tested against and validated in two separate groups of children with PSG-confirmed OSA. The instrument correctly classified 86 and 85 percent of children and had a sensitivity of 0.85 and 0.81, with specificity of 0.87 for both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]; it has also been validated in children with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The SRBD scale contains a four-item sleepiness subscale that has been validated against the Multiple Sleep Latency test (MSLT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The total score on the PSQ ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, and a score &ge;0.33 suggests high probability for presence of OSA. &#160;</p><p>A questionnaire that elicits key symptoms of OSA in children may be useful as an initial screening tool in clinical practice. As an example, the eight-item screening tool, I'M SLEEPY, was developed for primary care physicians to screen for pediatric OSA and validated in 150 children who underwent PSG. The parent version of the I'M SLEEPY tool has a sensitivity of 0.82, specificity of 0.5, and negative predictive value of 0.85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Thus, this is a reasonable tool to facilitate screening questions but should not replace a full clinical evaluation. </p><p>Among the sleep questionnaires used for research and clinical purposes in adults, only a few are applicable to children. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale that is commonly used for adults was modified for use in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>] and may be helpful to assess sleepiness in disorders such as OSA or narcolepsy, or to follow response to intervention. The use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale in adults is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing may be helpful in selected patients: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary disease</strong> &ndash; Children with any evidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease, such as asthma or signs of pulmonary hypertension, should be evaluated with chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. These tests should also be considered for children with confirmed severe OSA. The radiographs evaluate for lower airway disease that might contribute to hypoxemia during sleep, independent of upper airway obstruction. The cardiac testing evaluates for cardiac function and potential consequences of OSA, particularly left or right ventricular (LV or RV) hypertrophy. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of severity'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anatomic abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Children who have risks for airway abnormalities, such as those with Down syndrome or craniofacial abnormalities, should be evaluated with airway radiography, cephalometry (a lateral radiograph of the head and neck), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography of the upper airway. Some patients may warrant further evaluation with drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), which is typically performed after referral to a specialist. These tests can quantify the degree and site of obstruction and help with planning for surgical procedures, such as adenotonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or oral corrective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. These tests are not indicated in the routine diagnostic evaluation of children with suspected OSA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2865702403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Any testing that requires sedation or anesthesia should be undertaken with caution since effects on both upper airway muscle tone and the ventilatory response (to hypoxemia and hypercapnia) can precipitate respiratory decompensation in children with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].</p><p/><p>Laboratory tests are not routinely indicated.

These central apneas (spontaneous, movement-related, or sigh-related) usually improve with adenotonsillectomy. A central apnea index &gt;5 is rare and suggests a need for further evaluation for a cardiac, metabolic, or neurologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273987718\"><span class=\"h3\">Further interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some night-to-night variability occurs on sleep studies; as a result, a patient may have disparate AHI or RDI results on different nights, even when sleep stage and position are controlled. Nonetheless, the overall severity classification is reasonably consistent. In one study of 30 children each undergoing PSG on two occasions, RDIs varied between nights, but the overall severity classification changed in only two of the subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Attempts to specify severity of OSA and make treatment decisions solely on the basis of the RDI or AHI and minimum oxygen saturation may lead to misclassification. Additional variables that can be informative on sleep studies can include cortical arousals as a measure of sleep fragmentation (captured by the arousal index, hypopneas, and respiratory effort-related arousals [RERA]), number of and nadir of oxygen desaturations, time spent below an oxygen saturation of 90 or 88 percent, capnography, state of sleep (rapid eye movement [REM] versus non-rapid eye movement [NREM]), and body position during sleep. </p><p>PSG indices are not well correlated with symptoms of daytime functional impairment, which may include daytime sleepiness (eg, falling asleep at school), headaches, low school grades due to poor concentration, and several symptoms that can mimic the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity are the major risk factors for OSA. Other conditions that reduce upper airway size, affect the neural control of the upper airway, or impact the collapsibility of the upper airway are also risk factors for OSA. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key clinical manifestations of OSA include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111055 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nocturnal symptoms &ndash; Habitual snoring is an important clinical feature of OSA. Most children with OSA habitually snore, while lack of habitual snoring makes OSA less likely. However, the presence of habitual snoring is insufficient for the diagnosis of OSA because many children who snore do not have OSA. Other nocturnal symptoms in some patients include sleepwalking, enuresis, or sweating. (See <a href=\"#H2466221337\" class=\"local\">'Nocturnal symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Daytime symptoms &ndash; Inattention, learning problems, and behavioral problems (eg, hyperactivity, impulsivity, rebelliousness, and aggression) are associated with sleep-disordered breathing including OSA in children. Daytime sleepiness is also associated with OSA, but may not be present, especially in young children. The possibility of OSA should be investigated in children and adolescents presenting with these problems, particularly if the child also has obesity or other risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H744308135\" class=\"local\">'Daytime symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregivers should be asked about snoring during all routine health care visits and when symptoms raise a concern for OSA. Children who snore on most or all nights, or snore loudly, require a careful history and physical examination. Continued concern for OSA should prompt referral to a clinician with expertise in pediatric OSA. Polysomnography (PSG) is needed to make a definitive diagnosis of OSA (ie, confirm clinically suspected OSA) and can assist with treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"#H965167384\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H934949135\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attended in-laboratory nocturnal PSG (sleep study) is the gold standard for diagnosis of OSA. However, there is considerable variation in practice regarding the use of PSG to confirm the diagnosis when OSA is clinically suspected. (See <a href=\"#H2535058340\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of OSA requires both clinical and PSG criteria. The PSG criterion is often an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;1 per hour of sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111056\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111056 \">table 2</a>). However, the AHI must be considered in the context of the child's health, symptoms, and daytime functional impairment to most accurately assess OSA significance, severity, and impact. Severe OSA is typically associated with an AHI &gt;10, decreases in oxyhemoglobin saturation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercapnia on PSG.
