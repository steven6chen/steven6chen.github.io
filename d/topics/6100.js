Adherence to asthma medication regimens tends to be very poor, with the reported rates of nonadherence ranging from 30 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Up to three-quarters of the total costs associated with asthma may be due to poor asthma control. </p><p>Improved patient adherence may lead to improvements in asthma control and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The role of the clinician is to adequately inform the patient about the prescribed regimen, and to discuss the importance of adherence even in the absence of symptoms. In the patient who subsequently manifests nonadherence, the clinician should explore with the patient barriers to adherence and methods to overcome these barriers.</p><p>Strategies to enhance adherence to asthma therapy will be reviewed here. An approach to asthma management, a discussion of what patients need to know about their asthma, and the role of peak flow monitoring are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What do patients need to know about their asthma?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR NONADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors are associated with nonadherence to asthma therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/1,2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,6</a>]. Medication-related factors include difficulties with inhaler devices, complex regimens, side effects, cost of medication, dislike of medication, and distant pharmacies.</p><p>Factors unrelated to medications include misunderstanding or lack of instruction, fears about side effects, dissatisfaction with health care professionals, <span class=\"nowrap\">unexpressed/undiscussed</span> fears or concerns, inappropriate expectations, poor <span class=\"nowrap\">supervision/training</span> or follow-up, anger about one's condition or its treatment, underestimation of severity, cultural issues, stigmatization, forgetfulness or complacency, attitudes toward ill health, and religious issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Social barriers such as complicated work schedules, caring for other family members, or even the perceived safety of the neighborhood can all affect adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Finally, stress, depression, and comorbidities can all influence adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Several other reasons make adherence to asthma treatment recommendations problematic: medication regimens are of long duration and include multiple medicines; dosing may occur on both a fixed schedule and an as needed basis; and patients go through periods of symptom remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A number of types of nonadherence can interfere with therapy, including underuse, overuse, or erratic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Underuse of asthma medications appears to be more common than overuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a study comparing self-reported use of inhaled medications recorded in a diary to actual use determined by an electronic monitor of inhaler activation, it was found that subjects were not as compliant as they reported to be in their diaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another study found that inhaled beta agonists are no more likely to be overused than anti-inflammatory agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This observation tends to dispel the concern that patients will overuse inhaled beta agonists because of their fast symptom relief.</p><p>It is important to appreciate that nonadherence does not necessarily represent irrational behavior. There are many influences that may make a patient-initiated change in the regimen appropriate, such as a belief that the medication is not needed, intolerable side effects, problems with cost, and the inconvenience of obtaining refills. This problem has been described as &quot;intelligent nonadherence&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Interventions such as shared decision-making or problem-solving that take into account the beliefs and priorities of each patient have had some, but not complete, success, with shared decision-making being most successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. With the features of the electronic health record becoming more robust, medications can be ordered electronically through patient portals, and integrated speech recognition technology may be feasible for reminding patients to refill medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPROVING ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers can utilize a series of strategies to help improve their patient&rsquo;s adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. These strategies include developing a partnership with the patient (or <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/caregiver),</span> seeking to understand the patient&rsquo;s concerns and barriers to adherence, providing information that is personalized to that patient&rsquo;s disease or situation, and keeping the patient&rsquo;s health literacy in mind when talking to the patient and giving written instructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3692083901\"><span class=\"h2\">Establish partnership</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the first, and most important, steps is to develop a partnership with the patient (and <span class=\"nowrap\">family/caregivers)</span> to establish the goals of therapy. Discuss the general goals of asthma therapy with the patient and determine the patient's goals as well. With the patient, come to an agreement on what the goals of therapy should be [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. </p><p>The clinician should explain the recommended actions and the benefits that come from these actions. If possible, incorporate the patient's goals or expectations into the list of benefits. For example, &quot;using medicine before the start of the game will allow you to stay in for the entire period.&quot; </p><p>At subsequent visits, provide positive reinforcement of the things the patient has accomplished (eg, keeping appointment, taking medications more regularly, longer time between emergency department visits, improved health).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1423685941\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify barriers to adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may have multiple reasons for not taking their medications regularly, so it is essential to identify the reasons that pertain to each patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient may have concerns about adverse effects of a medication or the expense: Be sure to address fears or concerns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient did not understand the number of <span class=\"nowrap\">inhalations/frequency:</span> Simplify the regimen as much as possible and write it down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient misunderstood the difference between rescue and controller medications: Explain how each medication works to control or prevent symptoms and write it down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test patients' understanding by having them repeat instructions to you in their own words, or provide a scenario and ask patients how they would respond.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has too many other stresses to focus on their own health: Encourage the patient to seek support through a family member, caregiver, friend, neighbor, or support group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient feels isolated or angry about their <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/therapy:</span> Provide opportunities to meet other patients who have had the same or similar experiences.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2626873542\"><span class=\"h2\">Provide written instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines recommend that <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/families</span> should be given written instructions about how to use long-term control medications (daily self-management) and how to manage exacerbations (rescue medications, trigger avoidance, seeking help) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. The instructions should include the dose, frequency of administration, guidelines for changing dose or adding medications, adverse effects to report to the clinician, and contact information for securing urgent care, if needed. Electronic reminders may also help improve adherence, although further work is needed to clarify best practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
