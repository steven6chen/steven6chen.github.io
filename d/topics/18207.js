The most serious risk is spontaneous preterm delivery, which plays a major role in the increased perinatal mortality and short-term and long-term morbidity observed in these infants. Higher rates of fetal growth restriction and congenital anomalies also contribute to adverse outcome in twin births. In addition, monochorionic twins are at risk for complications unique to these pregnancies, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which can be lethal or associated with serious morbidity.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the antepartum care of women with twin pregnancy. Intrapartum management is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79771893\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF EARLY ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound examination is the only safe and reliable method for definitive diagnosis of twin gestation. Early ultrasound assessment also provides accurate estimation of gestational age, which is important in all pregnancies, but particularly important in management of twin pregnancies because of the higher risks for preterm delivery and growth restriction. In addition, chorionicity and amnionicity can be determined by ultrasound examination (see <a href=\"#H79772513\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of chorionicity'</a> below). This is critical because monochorionic twins have a shared fetoplacental circulation, which puts them at risk for specific serious pregnancy complications, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome and twin anemia-polycythemia sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. These complications increase the risk for neurologic morbidity and perinatal mortality in monochorionic twins compared with dichorionic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/2,3,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6-9</a>]. In addition to the complications associated with monochorionic twinning, monoamniotic twins also are at risk for cord entanglement and conjoined twins.</p><p>Most pregnant women in resource-rich countries undergo routine screening ultrasound examination. Randomized trials comparing routine ultrasound examination with ultrasound performed only for clinical indications have proven that a significant number of twin pregnancies are not recognized until the third trimester or delivery in women who do not undergo routine ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, the RADIUS (Routine Antenatal Diagnostic Imaging with Ultrasound Study) study of over 15,000 pregnant women reported that 38 percent of twin pregnancies remained unrecognized until after 26 weeks of gestation in women who did not have a routine second trimester ultrasound examination, and 13 percent of twins were not diagnosed until delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The Helsinki Ultrasound Trial reported similar findings: Approximately 25 percent of twin pregnancies were not identified until after 21 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In both trials, no twin pregnancies were missed on ultrasound examination.</p><p>A policy of routine first or second trimester ultrasound examination would diagnose twin gestations at a time when amnionicity and chorionicity are easily determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Prenatal ultrasound screening guidelines vary worldwide. In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) does not endorse routine ultrasound examination because, in a population of women with low-risk pregnancy, routine diagnostic sonography has not resulted in a reduction in perinatal morbidity and mortality or a lower rate of unnecessary interventions in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/10,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13</a>]. This may be related to the small numbers of twins in these trials and a lack of a standardized protocol for management of multiple gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. ACOG endorses ultrasound examination when there are specific indications for imaging, such as when twins are suspected because uterine size is greater than expected for menstrual dates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79772513\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of chorionicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is an effective prenatal tool for determining amnionicity and chorionicity. The optimal time for performing the ultrasound examination is in the first trimester after 7 weeks (sensitivity &ge;98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]), with lower but acceptable accuracy in the early second trimester (sensitivity &ge;90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Sonographic assessment of the fetal membranes is more difficult and less accurate in the third trimester, especially in the setting of oligohydramnios.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of two separate placentas is a highly reliable indicator of dichorionic twins. This indicator is generally only useful in early pregnancy since separate placentas often appear fused later in gestation. Rarely, a monochorionic placenta that is bilobed or has a succenturiate lobe gives the appearance of two separate placentas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of the intertwin membrane should be determined and its characteristics assessed early in pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Monochorionic/monoamniotic</strong></span> -- The intertwin membrane is absent in a <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/monoamniotic</span> twin pregnancy. Visualizing the intertwin membrane becomes more difficult with advancing gestational age because of fetal crowding, progressive thinning of the membrane, and, in some cases, development of oligohydramnios in one or both sacs. These factors may lead to a false diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/monoamniotic</span> twins. On the other hand, <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/monoamniotic</span> twins may be misdiagnosed as <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> twins when separation of the amnion and chorion is mistaken for an intertwin membrane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Dichorionic/diamniotic</strong></span> -- An intertwin membrane with the &quot;twin peak&quot; or &quot;lambda&quot; sign indicates dichorionic twins. The twin peak or lambda sign refers to a triangular projection of tissue that extends between layers of the intertwin membrane from a fused dichorionic placenta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79928\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79928 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is best seen at 10 to 14 weeks, becomes less prominent after 20 weeks of gestation, and may disappear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">An additional clue that twins are dichorionic is that the intertwin membrane is thicker with dichorionic than monochorionic twins since the <span class=\"nowrap\">dichorionic/diamniotic</span> membrane consists of four layers (ie, two layers of both amnion and chorion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75595\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75595 \">image 2</a>), whereas the intertwin membrane in a <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> pregnancy only consists of two layers of amnion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56124\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56124 \">image 3</a>). There is no consensus about the cut-off between thin and thick membranes; thresholds of 1.5 to 2 mm in the first trimester have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>]. The difference in membrane thickness is less obvious later in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Monochorionic/diamniotic</strong></span> -- An intertwin membrane with the &quot;T&quot; sign indicates a <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> placenta. This sign refers to the appearance of the thin intertwin membrane composed of two amnions as it takes off from the placenta at a 90 degree angle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The number of chorion and amnion membrane layers in the intertwin membrane can be counted, but it is technically difficult; therefore, this method is not commonly employed. It is best accomplished between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation using high resolution, magnified images with the membrane perpendicular to the ultrasound beam.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the first trimester, identification of fetuses of different sex is a highly reliable means of confirming a dichorionic pregnancy.</p><p/><p>In a study including over 600 twin pregnancies at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation at a tertiary referral center, use of the T sign, lambda sign, and number of placentas for determining monochorionicity had sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 99.8 percent, with only one dichorionic pregnancy incorrectly assigned as monochorionic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A placental hematoma precluded diagnosis of the T or lambda sign in the incorrectly assigned pregnancy. Other smaller studies have reported sensitivity of 90 to 100 percent and specificity of 97.4 to 99.5 percent using these markers and fetal sex. The lower sensitivities in some studies may be related to assessment very early (&lt;7 weeks) in the first trimester. In a 2016 systematic review of the accuracy of the lambda sign alone (2292 twins, nine studies), sensitivity for predicting dichorionicity was 99 percent (95% CI 98&ndash;100) and specificity was 95 percent (95% CI 92&ndash;97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Pooled sensitivity of the absence of the lambda sign for predicting monochorionicity was 96 percent (95% CI 92&ndash;98) and pooled specificity was 99 percent (95% CI 98&ndash;99).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1496897589\"><span class=\"h2\">Other significant findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to assessment of gestational age, number of fetuses, and <span class=\"nowrap\">amnionicity/chorionicity,</span> first trimester ultrasound examination may detect abnormalities associated with adverse outcome. These include congenital anomalies, crown-rump length discordance (associated with aneuploidy, twin-twin transfusion syndrome [TTTS]), enlarged nuchal translucency (associated with aneuploidy, congenital anomalies, TTTS).

Rare cases of dizygotic twins with monochorionic placentation after assisted reproductive technology (ART) have been reported, with unexplained etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p>Monozygotic or &quot;identical&quot; twins result from ovulation and fertilization of a single oocyte, with subsequent division of the zygote. Timing of egg division generally determines placentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53594 \">figure 1</a>). Monozygotic twins may have two separate placentas or one placenta that is <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/monoamniotic</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span>. However, case reports of atypical twinning (eg, chimeric twins, mirror image twins, discordant monozygotic twins, polar body twins) have prompted hypotheses for other mechanisms of monozygotic twinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>From an imaging perspective, approximately 80 percent of dichorionic placentas are associated with dizygotic twins and 20 percent are associated with monozygotic twins. All monochorionic placentas are associated with monozygotic twins, with the rare exceptions described above in pregnancies conceived by ART. Thus, if the placenta is dichorionic and the fetuses are the same sex, about 20 percent will be &quot;identical&quot; twins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twin births account for approximately 3 percent of live births and 97 percent of multiple births in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Dizygotic twins are more common than monozygotic twins, approximately 70 and 30 percent of twins, respectively (in the absence of use of assisted reproductive technology [ART]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The prevalence of dizygotic twins varies among populations whereas the prevalence of monozygotic twins is relatively stable worldwide at 3 to 5 per 1000 births.</p><p>The major factors influencing the prevalence of dizygotic twins are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Use of fertility stimulating drugs</strong> &ndash; Use of fertility enhancing treatments (ART and non-ART) substantially increases the prevalence of twin pregnancy compared with natural conception. These therapies account for most of the increase in twin births in recent years: In the United States twin births increased from <span class=\"nowrap\">1/53</span> infants in 1980 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/29</span> infants in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Over one-third of all twin infants born in the United States can be attributed to iatrogenic interventions (IVF, ovulation induction, superovulation plus intrauterine insemination) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dizygotic twins are more common in pregnancies conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF) than in naturally conceived pregnancies (&ge;95 percent versus 70 percent) since double embryo transfer is commonly performed as part of IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. Interestingly, IVF also appears to increase the risk of embryo cleavage resulting in monozygotic twins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy outcome after assisted reproductive technology&quot;, section on 'Monozygotic multiples'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dizygotic twins are also more common in pregnancies conceived with ovulation inducing agents alone (without IVF) than in naturally conceived pregnancies since these drugs increase the likelihood of ovulation and fertilization of multiple oocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maternal age</strong> &ndash; Advancing maternal age is associated with an increased prevalence of dizygotic twin births. Naturally conceived dizygotic twinning increases fourfold between age 15 and age 35; this may be related to rising follicle stimulating hormone concentration with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Older women are also more likely to use fertility treatments. One-third of the increase in multiple births in recent decades has been attributed to increasing age at childbirth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although maternal age affects the prevalence of twins, it does not appear to affect pregnancy outcome significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/40-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-46</a>]. When matched for chorionicity, women &ge;35 years appear to have the same or a lower risk of adverse perinatal outcome as younger women with twin pregnancies in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/40,41,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Race/geographic</span> area</strong> &ndash; Significant <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnic/racial</span> variations in the prevalence of naturally conceived dizygotic twins occur worldwide.

Thus, a woman is at increased risk of having twins if she has a family history of twin births. The family history of the biologic father appears to have little or no effect on his partner's risk of having twins; however, he could pass the familial trait to his daughter. This theory is supported by gene mapping studies in animals and humans that found specific genetic mutations expressed by oocytes or ovarian cells were at least partly responsible for twinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maternal weight and height</strong> &ndash; Obese (body mass index [BMI] &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and tall women (&ge;65 inches [164 cm]) are at greater risk for dizygotic twin birth than underweight (BMI &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and short women (&lt;61 inches [155 cm]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diet</strong> &ndash; Diet may be an important factor affecting the dizygotic twinning rate in some geographic areas, among certain races, and in women of particular body habitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/39,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,53,54</a>]. As an example, some studies have reported that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation increased the rate of twinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Spontaneous reduction of one sac (&quot;vanishing twin&quot;) occurred in 27 percent of pregnancies diagnosed as twins prior to 7 weeks of gestation; both sacs were lost in 9 percent. Interestingly, studies have consistently shown that, in pregnancies conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART), the rate of early loss of the entire pregnancy is significantly lower for twin than singleton gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Rates of late fetal and infant death are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66305 \">table 1</a>).

A retrospective study using data from the population-based Northern Multiple Pregnancy Register and Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey in the United Kingdom provided support for this theory.

Because of placental vascular anastomoses between monochorionic twins, the intrauterine death of one twin in a monochorionic twin pregnancy can cause acute hypotension, anemia, and ischemia in its co-twin, resulting in morbidity or death of the co-twin. For this reason, if fetal assessment after 26 weeks of gestation suggests impending death of one twin, we suggest prompt delivery of monochorionic twins rather than expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Prompt delivery is unlikely to benefit the survivor after death of one twin of a dichorionic or monochorionic gestation. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Death of one twin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated fetal fibronectin level or short cervical length on ultrasound examination may predict women at particularly increased risk of preterm delivery; however, the predictive value is low in asymptomatic patients. No intervention has been proven to be effective in reducing preterm birth rates in twin pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Preterm labor and delivery'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dub&eacute; J, Dodds L, Armson BA.
