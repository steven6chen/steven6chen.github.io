However, in resource-poor areas, where screening programs are not well established, cervical cancer continues to affect and kill hundreds of thousands of women. In 2012, approximately 528,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide and were responsible for over 260,000 deaths, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Seventy percent of the global burden occurs in resource-poor countries, with more than one-fifth of these diagnosed in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Compared with other gynecologic cancers, cervical cancer most often affects younger women, with a mean age at diagnosis of 49 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many of these women with early-stage disease will be cured and have significant additional life expectancy following completion of treatment. Consequently, they will face years of potential treatment-related side effects. They may also have concerns regarding fertility preservation. Finally, given their younger age, these women may have more family and work responsibilities than women with other gynecologic cancers, which will impact their survivorship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation (chemoRT). While this treatment might be curative, these young women will then live years with significant treatment sequelae, and will also lose their fertility as well as ovarian function as a result of treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to cervical cancer survivors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395690\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PRIMARY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, all women undergo a pretreatment staging evaluation to help determine the approach, which can then be stratified on whether the disease is early or locally advanced at presentation. The overwhelming majority of long-term cervical cancer survivors were originally treated for early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer. In contrast, the median survival of women diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer is generally less than two years. Therefore, this section will review the treatment of women with early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962607291\"><span class=\"h2\">Early-stage cervical cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early-stage cervical cancer is defined as disease confined to the cervix measuring less than 4 cm in size (stage IA to IB1; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 1</a>)). These patients may be appropriately treated with either radical surgery or concomitant chemoradiation, which is usually based on the volume of disease, patient characteristics, and surgical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

For most of these patients, a radical hysterectomy will have been performed, which entails removal of the parametrial and paravaginal tissue to include a 2 cm margin of normal tissue around the tumor, and excision of the upper one-third of the vagina. In addition to the hysterectomy, most will have undergone removal of the regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which may lead to subsequent issues with lymphedema, among other issues. (See <a href=\"#H13395749\" class=\"local\">'Lymphedema'</a> below.)</p><p>For select patients, an alternative approach to modified radical hysterectomy may have been performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility-sparing surgery for cervical cancer&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cone biopsy may have been sufficient treatment for women with microscopically identified cervical cancer (stage IA1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A radical trachelectomy (removal of the cervix only) may have been performed, particularly if women were of reproductive age at the time of diagnosis, and desired fertility preservation.</p><p/><p>In addition, non-surgical management with radiation therapy (RT) with or without concomitant chemotherapy may have been performed if patients were not surgical candidates for whatever reason at the time of diagnosis.

Therefore, cervical cancer survivors may report additional therapy after surgery consisting of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant RT &ndash; RT is usually administered to women if intermediate risk factors were identified at final pathologic analysis of the uterine specimen. Risk is based on the presence of lymphovascular space invasion, depth of cervical stromal involvement, and tumor size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

It is usually relocated to the peritoneum lateral to the intra-abdominal or lower paracolic gutters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian transposition before pelvic radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962607436\"><span class=\"h2\">Locally advanced cervical cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This category includes patients with cervical tumors 4 cm or larger (stage IB2) and women with disease that has locally spread outside of the true pelvis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invades the bladder or rectum (stage II to IVA; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 1</a>)). For these patients, primary treatment consists of definitive chemoradiation with weekly doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, which is used to increase tissue sensitivity to the effects of RT. Although not commonly administered, some patients may have received a second agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>) during RT. These women are treated with combination RT (both external beam and brachytherapy) as well as radiosensitizing cisplatin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962607467\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the role of adjuvant chemotherapy (ie, following definitive chemoradiation) is investigational, some patients may have received systemic chemotherapy. The most common regimens administered in this context are platinum based (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>). The rationale for adjuvant chemotherapy (sometimes referred to as &quot;outback&quot; chemotherapy) is discussed separately.

However, this is not uniformly performed because there are no prospective data to show that doing so improves survival outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer#H10523258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Role of hysterectomy after chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25937120\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTTREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance after primary curative therapy for cervical cancer is uniformly recommended, although its effectiveness is not well studied. The main goal of surveillance is early detection of those recurrences that might be amenable to potentially curative salvage therapy. This is only considered in patients who have an isolated central pelvic recurrence. While there is no consensus approach to surveillance, a reasonable strategy takes into account the patient&rsquo;s risk for recurrence (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-patterns-of-recurrence-and-posttreatment-surveillance#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Patterns of recurrence and posttreatment surveillance&quot;, section on 'Surveillance strategies'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with high-risk disease (advanced stage, treated with primary <span class=\"nowrap\">chemotherapy/radiation</span> therapy (RT) or surgery plus adjuvant therapy) should be followed every three months for the first two years, every six months for years 3 through 5, and then annually.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with low-risk disease (early stage, treated with surgery alone, no adjuvant therapy) can be followed every six months for the first two years, and then annually.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962607517\"><span class=\"h2\">Components of follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful clinical examination (including review of systems and comprehensive physical examination) is the most important component of the evaluation. Annual cervicovaginal cytology is generally advised rather than one at each clinical visit. The exception to this would be those treated with pelvic RT because the anatomic and histologic changes to the vaginal mucosa may hinder the accuracy of cytologic evaluation.

This topic is discussed in more detail separately.

These data suggest that the modalities used in definitive treatment can result in significant symptoms experienced by the long-term survivor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. What follows are discussions of specific issues addressed in the literature that relate to this population. More general information on cancer survivorship is discussed elsewhere.

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to the bladder and rectum are often disrupted during the radical hysterectomy because they run in the inferior portion of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments and are most often divided during the division of the parametrium and uterosacral ligaments. As a result, patients may experience bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] (see <a href=\"#H962607703\" class=\"local\">'Bladder dysfunction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H962607709\" class=\"local\">'Bowel dysfunction'</a> below). Sympathetic denervation can lead to bowel and bladder symptoms, including urinary urgency and incontinence, constipation, and incomplete stool evacuation or fecal incontinence. These symptoms can be divided into acute (in the immediate postoperative period) and long-term effects. The pelvic lymphadenectomy performed as part of the standard surgery can lead to lymphedema, and the resection of the upper vagina included in the radical surgery may lead to sexual dysfunction as a result of a shortened vagina. Finally, division of the utero-ovarian ligaments may result in premature ovarian failure due to disruption of the ovarian blood supply.</p><p>Techniques to decrease the postoperative sequelae of radical hysterectomy include the so-called &quot;nerve-sparing&quot; radical hysterectomy, and sentinel node dissection rather than full pelvic lymphadenectomy. While both of these procedures are performed, neither is currently considered to be standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2553409624\"><span class=\"h2\">Sequelae associated with chemoradiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in the case of radical surgery, there are acute (self-limited) and long-term side effects of combination chemotherapy and radiation (chemoRT). While the acute side effects are short-lived and manageable, the cervical cancer survivor may suffer from lifelong side effects that significantly impact quality of life. Similar to radical surgery, these symptoms are most often related to bowel or bladder function, vaginal function, and loss of ovarian function.</p><p>One study that included mostly women with stage I disease (73 percent) reported that patients who received radiation with or without chemotherapy had significantly worse quality of life (QOL) when adjusting for other covariates than patients who had surgery alone. The radiated patients also reported higher perceived stress, depression, and anxiety as well as more frequent gynecologic problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962607703\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder dysfunction is a common long-term concern for cervical cancer survivors, particularly those treated with chemoradiation rather than radical hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The incidence varies, but over 20 percent appear to be impacted. As an example, in one study, approximately 25 percent of patients reported treatment-related symptoms such as frequent voiding two years after radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, some reports suggest that 20 to 50 percent of patients may have treatment-induced bladder symptoms that have a significant effect on QOL over a 20-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>While radical hysterectomy commonly results in bladder symptoms in the postoperative recovery course (including bladder hypertonicity and decreased sensation to bladder filling) as a result of the disruption of autonomic nerve fibers that innervate the bladder, it is not clear that these issues persist in long-term survivors. In one study, 30 to 75 percent of patients reported bladder symptoms, including urinary leakage and urgency, frequent urinary tract infections, and overall urinary dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, another study suggested that urinary symptoms decrease with time and may no longer be distressing two years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In one study, comparative lower urinary tract toxicities associated with RT or radical hysterectomy in 70 women previously treated for cervical cancer were evaluated using multichannel urodynamic tests.

Predictably, more advanced-stage patients were in the RT group and more early-stage patients were in the radical hysterectomy group. While RT and surgery resulted in similar rates of lower urinary tract symptoms (77 versus 71 percent, respectively), the incidence and type of specific toxicities appeared to differ:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients treated with radical hysterectomy, a significantly higher proportion complained of straining symptoms compared with those treated with RT (31 versus 9 percent).

IMRT allows minimization of the volume of radiated small intestine. One study reported results following treatment of 71 patients with RT; 46 were treated with IMRT and 25 with conformal RT. After a median follow-up of 18 months, 31 percent of patients had grade 2 bowel toxicity and 12.6 percent had grade 3 or higher bowel toxicity. The authors concluded that restricting small and large bowel dose volume can reduce the incidence of severe late bowel toxicity to less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-cervical-cancer-survivors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The IMRT patients experienced lower acute (proctitis, enteritis, cystitis, myelosuppression, and dermatitis) and chronic (enterocolitis and cystitis) toxicities than did those treated with conventional RT. There were no significant differences in overall survival between groups.

Much of this underestimation is due to a failure to ask on the part of the provider and a reluctance to report on the part of the patient.

In our practice, an oncologist follows patients for three to five years, after which they may transition back to a general gynecologist or primary care clinician.
