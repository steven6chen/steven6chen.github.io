These disorders are grouped together because they run in families and have similar symptoms. The different types of CMT are caused by problems in many different genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672042709\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, people with CMT have weakness and decreased sensation in the lower part of their legs, and they have problems with their feet. Sometimes their hands and wrists are also affected.</p><p>Symptoms of the most common form, called CMT1, usually start in childhood, and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness of the foot and lower leg muscles &ndash; This weakness often leads to repeated ankle sprains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot problems, such as high arches and toes that bend up at the middle joint (called hammertoes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower legs that look very narrow at the bottom and wider at the calf (like an upside-down champagne bottle or a stork leg) &ndash; The legs look like this because there is so little muscle near the ankle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness in the foot or being unable to feel where the foot is placed &ndash; This can cause the person to be clumsy and to fall a lot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal curves in the spine &ndash; The medical terms for these curves are &quot;scoliosis&quot; and &quot;kyphosis.&quot; These usually develop later in life than the other symptoms.</p><p/><p>In other types of CMT, the symptoms might be slightly different. For example, there is usually more loss of sensation with CMT2 than with CMT1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672042724\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you develop weakness or lose feeling in your legs or arms, see a doctor or nurse. If someone in your family has CMT, be sure to mention that during your visit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672042739\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you develop symptoms of CMT, your doctor or nurse will ask you questions and do an exam. If he or she is unsure what is causing your symptoms, you might need tests, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These tests are used to check for the genes that cause CMT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve conduction studies or electromyography &ndash; These tests measure how well electrical signals travel across the nerves that control the arms or legs. They can also show whether the muscles respond to electrical signals from the nerves the way they should.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve biopsy &ndash; For a biopsy, a doctor takes a small chunk of nerve to look at under the microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672042754\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for CMT involves working with an occupational or physical therapist. When you work with a therapist, you learn new ways to do the tasks you need to do, such as walk and climb stairs. You also learn special stretches and exercises that can help you have better control of your arms and legs. If your muscles cramp or get too tense because of your CMT, a therapist can also teach you ways to help those muscles relax.</p><p>Another thing that helps people with CMT is the use of special shoes, canes, walkers, and other devices. A physical therapist can recommend the most useful devices for each person.</p><p>People who have foot problems caused by CMT sometimes also need surgery to correct the problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672042769\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything else I should do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Always make sure all your doctors and nurses know you have CMT. There are certain medicines they should not prescribe to you because they can make CMT worse.</p><p>It might also be a good idea to exercise and to avoid gaining weight. This will help you keep the strength you do have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672042784\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to have children, ask your doctor what the chances are that your baby will have CMT.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
