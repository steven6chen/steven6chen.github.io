As a result, the elevation in blood pressure is primarily due to fluid overload, as evidenced by suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and enhanced release of atrial natriuretic peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although these changes are most prominent with severe disease, the incidence of hypertension is increased even in patients with a normal serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both a familial predisposition to hypertension and subclinical volume expansion are thought to be important in this setting.</p><p>Experimental studies of the nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis suggest that sodium retention in these disorders is due to increased reabsorption in the collecting tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Two different abnormalities in collecting tubule function have been identified in glomerular disease, both of which could increase sodium reabsorption:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide due at least in part to more rapid degradation of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by the enzyme phosphodiesterase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In an animal model of nephrotic syndrome, infusion of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor largely reverses this defect and restores the normal natriuretic response to volume expansion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cortical collecting tubule but not in other nephron segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This pump provides the energy for active sodium transport by pumping reabsorbed sodium out the cell into the peritubular capillary.</p><p/><p>How these changes might be induced by the nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis is not clear. They are not likely to be mediated by aldosterone, the secretion of which is reduced by volume expansion-mediated reductions in plasma renin activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute vascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is also common in acute vascular diseases, such as vasculitis or scleroderma renal crisis. In these settings, the elevation in blood pressure results from ischemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system rather than volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This difference in mechanism between glomerular and vascular disease may be of therapeutic importance.

The prevalence of hypertension is elevated in patients with kidney damage and a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increases further as the GFR falls.

If the hypertension persists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be effective, even in the low-renin hypertension often associated with acute glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In addition, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is cumbersome and expensive. Thus, we use office-based measurements to determine whether or not patients have achieved goal blood pressure. The appropriate technique for measuring blood pressure in the office is discussed elsewhere.

In 436 patients with CKD who underwent both ambulatory and office-based blood pressure measurements, for example, a daytime ambulatory systolic pressure greater than 145 mmHg was associated with a threefold increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and a nearly twofold increased risk of ESRD or death compared with patients whose daytime systolic pressure was 126 to 135 mmHg. The prognostic value of nighttime ambulatory blood pressure was even stronger. By contrast, the mean of six office-based measurements taken over two days was not associated with cardiovascular disease, ESRD, or death.</p><p>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring, which is less expensive than ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, are presented in detail separately.

This is also true in patients with CKD, most of whom, as discussed below, are treated with angiotensin inhibitors to slow disease progression. The potential benefits of sodium restriction were demonstrated in a crossover trial of 52 patients with proteinuric CKD (mean protein excretion of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and mean creatinine clearance of 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> all of whom were taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Four treatments were given in random order, each for six weeks: a low-sodium diet with placebo, a low-sodium diet with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a>, a regular-sodium diet with placebo, and a regular-sodium diet with valsartan. Compared with a regular-sodium diet (mean urinary sodium excretion 184 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day),</span> a low-sodium diet (mean 106 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> decreased blood pressure to a greater degree than addition of valsartan (11 versus 3 mmHg). Addition of valsartan had a minimal additional effect (2 mmHg) on blood pressure beyond a low-sodium diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140207190\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of diuretics and goal of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the reduction in renal function, higher doses of diuretics are typically required in patients with CKD who are usually volume expanded even in the absence of edema. Thiazide diuretics become less effective when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In such patients, loop diuretics are preferred as initial therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Torsemide</a>, which has a longer duration of action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, may be preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-resistant-hypertension#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of resistant hypertension&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>If edema persists, a thiazide diuretic can be added to the loop diuretic. The rationale for combined therapy is that most of the fluid leaving the loop of Henle after the administration of a loop diuretic is reabsorbed in the distal tubule, the site of action of thiazide diuretics. Thus, thiazides have an enhanced diuretic effect in patients treated with a loop diuretic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Thiazide plus loop diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of combined diuretic therapy has been illustrated in a report of five patients with CKD (serum creatinine 2.3 to 4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [203 to 433 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> who had an inadequate response to 160 to 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> in divided doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Increasing the furosemide dose had only limited efficacy. By contrast, the addition of 25 to 50 mg twice daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> produced a marked diuresis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorthalidone</a> is generally preferred to hydrochlorothiazide because it is more potent and has a longer duration of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, if hypertension persists once edema has been removed, plasma volume expansion may still be present and contribute to the hypertension. Thus, when diuretics are used to treat hypertension in patients with CKD without overt edema, the dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequency of diuretic should be increased when the antihypertensive response is inadequate.</p><p>Diuretic therapy should be increased until one of two endpoints is reached: the blood pressure goal is achieved or the patient has attained &quot;dry weight,&quot; which, in the presence of persistent hypertension, is defined as the weight at which further fluid loss leads to symptoms (cramps, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension) or leads to decreased tissue perfusion as evidenced by an otherwise unexplained elevation in the serum creatinine concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of antihypertensive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attainment of goal blood pressure in patients with CKD typically requires multidrug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].
