It is usually caused by bacteria but can also be caused by a virus or parasite.</p><p>You are more likely to get travelers' diarrhea if you travel in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asia (except Singapore and Japan)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Africa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>South America, Central America, and Mexico</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Countries around the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caribbean islands</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14951463\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of travelers' diarrhea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is runny or watery bowel movements. These usually start about 4 to 14 days after arriving. Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps in the lower belly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gas and bloating &ndash; Feeling like the belly is full, with pain in the middle or top of the belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling as though you need have a bowel movement even if you just did, or like you need to get to the toilet in a hurry</p><p/><p>Travelers' diarrhea usually lasts 1 to 5 days, but some people are sick for a week or longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14951478\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor or nurse gave you antibiotics to take in case you got diarrhea, you can take them instead of going to a doctor or nurse in another country. But you might need to see a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are sick for 10 to 14 days or longer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever of 102&ordm;F (40&ordm;C) or higher.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe belly pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have bloody diarrhea or you are vomiting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antibiotics you took did not help.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14951493\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. If you see a doctor or nurse, he or she will ask where you traveled and what you did. If the doctor thinks a parasite might be causing the diarrhea, he or she might ask for a bowel movement sample. Testing it can show if you have a parasite. But this is not usually needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14951510\"><span class=\"h1\">How is travelers' diarrhea treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important treatment is getting enough fluid. That's because diarrhea can cause the body to lose fluid. Adults with mild diarrhea can drink lots of fluids with water, salt, and sugar. Soup broth and water mixed with juice are good choices. If you are drinking enough, your urine will look light yellow or almost clear.</p><p>If you have diarrhea more than 4 times a day, you can drink an &quot;oral rehydration solution.&quot; You can buy this in a packet at the pharmacy. Mix it with bottled or boiled drinking water.</p><p>Other treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These medicines fight infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that ease diarrhea &ndash; These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loperamide</a> (brand name: Imodium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenoxylate-and-atropine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diphenoxylate-atropine</a> (sample brand name: Lomotil), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bismuth subsalicylate</a> (sample brand names: Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate). They can help, but they can also cause other health problems. Bismuth salicylate might not be safe for pregnant women or people who take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> for another condition. You should only take loperamide or diphenoxylate if you are also taking antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14951525\"><span class=\"h1\">Can travelers' diarrhea be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting travelers' diarrhea by being careful about what and how you eat and drink. While you are traveling:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not drink tap water. Drink bottled carbonated drinks, beer, wine, or hot tea or coffee instead. Brush your teeth with bottled water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use ice in drinks. Ice is usually made from tap water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat food from carts or stands in the street.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat sauces set out on restaurant tables. These include salsa and ketchup.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat fresh foods at room temperature. These include guacamole, fruit or chicken salads, and buffet food on a steam table.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat foods or drinks made with unpasteurized milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask for drinks in the bottle, without ice. If you drink from a glass, use a straw.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat fruits unless they have a peel and you have peeled them yourself.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure meat and seafood are well done and eggs have a firm yolk.</p><p/><p>If you can't find bottled water or soft drinks, you can make your drinking water safe by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boiling it for 3 minutes (let it cool before drinking)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding 5 drops of tincture of iodine to 4 cups of water and waiting 30 minutes &ndash; Tincture of iodine is a liquid you can buy at most pharmacies or camping goods stores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a water treatment filter from a camping or sports store</p><p/><p>Wash your hands after going to the bathroom, changing diapers, blowing your nose, touching animals, or taking out the trash.</p><p>If you have a serious health condition, travelers' diarrhea could cause you to lose too much water. This can be dangerous and even cause death. If you are going on a trip, talk to your doctor or nurse ahead of time. He or she might give you antibiotics to take while you are traveling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14951540\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
