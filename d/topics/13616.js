In their least aggressive form, phyllodes tumors behave like benign fibroadenomas, although with a propensity to recur locally following excision without wide margins. At the other end of the spectrum, other phyllodes tumors can metastasize distantly, sometimes degenerating histologically into sarcomatous lesions that lack an epithelial component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;phyllodes,&quot; which means leaf-like, describes the typical papillary projections that are seen on pathologic examination. Although they were originally called &quot;cystosarcoma phyllodes&quot; by Johannes M&uuml;ller in 1838 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], phyllodes tumors only occasionally have cystic components and are not true sarcomas by either cellular origin or biologic behavior. The terminology has since evolved, with over 60 synonyms having been applied to this entity before the term &quot;phyllodes tumors&quot; was adopted by the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of breast phyllodes tumors are discussed in this topic. Other benign (eg, fibroadenoma) or malignant lesions of the breast are discussed elsewhere.

Given their rarity, epidemiologic data are scant. In a study from Los Angeles county over a 17-year period, the average annual incidence rate of malignant phyllodes tumors was 2.1 per million women, and the incidence was higher in Latina whites than in non-Latina whites, Asians, and African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of phyllodes tumors occur in women, with a median age of presentation of 42 to 45 years (range 10 to 82 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-8</a>]. Higher-grade tumors are more common in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In men, phyllodes tumors usually occur in association with gynecomastia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Phyllodes tumors have been associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant condition that is characterized by the development of multiple tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No other etiologic or predisposing factors have been linked to phyllodes tumors.

Phyllodes lesions are primarily solid, hypoechoic, and well circumscribed on ultrasonography. Suspicion for a phyllodes tumor, rather than a fibroadenoma, is based on clinical features such as large tumor size at presentation and rapid growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although not always present, cystic areas within the mass on ultrasonography may increase the level of suspicion for phyllodes tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1649634069\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phyllodes tumors and fibroadenomas cannot be reliably differentiated by breast MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, when a phyllodes tumor has been diagnosed on core biopsy, breast MRI may help determine the extent of disease and resectability in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the routine use of breast MRI in surgical planning for phyllodes tumors is controversial and not supported by data. </p><p>Malignant phyllodes tumors are seen as well-circumscribed tumors with irregular walls, high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cystic change may be seen as well. A rapid enhancement pattern is seen more commonly with benign rather than malignant phyllodes tumors, which is the opposite of the pattern seen with adenocarcinomas of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast lesions suspicious for phyllodes tumors should undergo core biopsy, which is typically diagnostic. Compared with core biopsy, fine needle aspiration (FNA) is less accurate.

Some experts, however, advocated paying special attention to three major cytological features (fibromyxoid stromal fragments with spindle nuclei, fibroblastic pavements, and spindle cells of fibroblastic nature) to improve the accuracy of FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3422046703\"><span class=\"h3\">Core needle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On core needle biopsy, additional features can help distinguish phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas. Such features include increased cellularity, mitosis, stromal overgrowth, and fragmentation (stroma with epithelium at one or both ends of the fragment).

A core biopsy diagnosis of &quot;cellular fibroadenoma,&quot; &quot;cellular fibroepithelial lesion,&quot; or &quot;fibroepithelial lesion with cellular stroma&quot; should prompt surgical excision of the lesion, regardless of its appearance on imaging studies. Further pathologic characterization of the lesion may reveal a phyllodes tumor. Additionally, core biopsy has a 25 to 30 percent false negative rate when used to diagnose phyllodes tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Thus, if a solid mass has a benign core biopsy but subsequently grows rapidly or becomes symptomatic, an excisional biopsy is also indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620029797\"><span class=\"h3\">Gross</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grossly, phyllodes tumors may be indistinguishable from fibroadenomas.

In a study of 605 cases of phyllodes tumors, stromal atypia, mitoses, overgrowth, and surgical margin status (defined as complete, focally involved, and diffusely involved) were shown to be independent predictors of recurrence, with surgical margin status being the most important.

While we aim for a 1-cm margin for phyllodes tumors, we will accept a narrower but clear margin for benign, but not borderline or malignant, phyllodes tumors. </p><p>Surgical margins of &ge;1 cm have been associated with a lower local recurrence rate in borderline and malignant phyllodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/1,4,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,48</a>]. In a retrospective review of 48 women with high-grade malignant phyllodes tumors, 10 patients were treated with local excision (margins &lt;1 cm), 14 with wide local excision (margins &ge;1 cm), and 24 with mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. At a median follow-up of nine years, the local recurrence rate was higher after local excision with narrow margins than after wide local excision (60 versus 28 percent). Local recurrence and cancer-specific survival were related to tumor size and excision margins. The average tumor size was 7.8 cm in this study.</p><p>As long as adequate margins can be achieved, breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy are equally effective in treating malignant phyllodes tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/1,4,12,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,52</a>]. In a study of 821 women with malignant phyllodes tumors from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, mastectomy and wide local excision were performed in 52 and 48 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with mastectomy, wide local excision was associated with equivalent or improved cause-specific survival regardless of tumor size. </p><p>Mastectomy is generally not indicated for benign phyllodes unless negative margins cannot be achieved <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the tumor is so large that breast-conserving surgery would result in suboptimal cosmetic outcomes.</p><p>Despite best surgical efforts, phyllodes tumors are known to recur locally with rates that vary with tumor grade. In earlier reports, benign, borderline, and malignant phyllodes tumors had local recurrence rates of 8, 21, and 36 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/36,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,48</a>]. More contemporary series reported lower rates of local recurrence. In a study of 479 phyllodes tumors (74 percent benign, 19 percent borderline, 7 percent indeterminate), the recurrence rate was only 6.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Recurrent phyllodes tumors require surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy as discussed below.

However, when adequate surgical margins can be achieved, there is less agreement about the need for adjuvant RT. We base our decision about adjuvant RT on tumor grade:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do <strong>not</strong> suggest adjuvant RT for patients with <strong>benign</strong> phyllodes tumors that are widely excised. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest adjuvant RT for patients with <strong>borderline</strong> or <strong>malignant</strong> phyllodes tumors following surgical excision. </p><p/><p>Adjuvant RT has been shown to reduce local recurrence of borderline or malignant phyllodes tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/26,27,34,35,48,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,34,35,48,54,55</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eight observational studies, adjuvant RT clearly reduced local recurrences of borderline or malignant phyllodes tumors after breast-conserving surgery (HR 0.31, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.72) but had no effect on overall or disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The effect of adjuvant RT on local recurrences after mastectomy was less pronounced (HR 0.68, 95% CI -0.28 to 1.64).</p><p>In clinical practice, the utilization of adjuvant RT for phyllodes tumors appears to be modest. In a retrospective review of the National Cancer Database that included 3120 patients with malignant phyllodes tumors, only 14 percent received adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Patients were more likely to receive radiation therapy if they were diagnosed later in the study, were 50 to 59 years old, had tumors &gt;10 cm, or had lymph nodes removed. In adjusted models, adjuvant radiation reduced local recurrence but did not impact survival after a median follow-up of 53 months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on limited data, the role of systemic chemotherapy in phyllodes tumors is limited. Patients with benign or borderline phyllodes tumors are usually cured with surgery and should not be offered chemotherapy unless they develop unresectable metastases. </p><p>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in malignant phyllodes tumor is controversial. Malignant phyllodes tumors are pathologically and clinically most similar to soft tissue sarcomas; however, localized malignant phyllodes tumors have a better prognosis than most high-grade sarcomas of similar stage. Thus, systemic chemotherapy should be considered for malignant phyllodes tumors with even more caution. </p><p>There have been no randomized studies of adjuvant chemotherapy specifically for phyllodes tumors. In a small observational study, 28 patients with malignant phyllodes tumors were treated with either adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> or observation alone after surgical resection based upon patient preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Although the five-year relapse-free survival was not different between the two groups, the study was retrospective, nonrandomized, and underpowered. It did not utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> in combination with doxorubicin (which is superior to dacarbazine plus doxorubicin in other soft tissue sarcomas). </p><p>Based on experience and limited data, we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy only to a small minority of patients with high-risk (&gt;10 cm) or recurrent malignant phyllodes tumors who have excellent functional status and minimal comorbidities, and only after a thorough discussion about the risks, benefits, and controversial nature of such treatment. When systemic chemotherapy is indicated, malignant phyllodes tumors should be treated according to protocols designed for soft tissue sarcoma, rather than breast cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with metastatic disease, systemic treatments used are the same as those used for soft tissue sarcoma but often have limited or short-lived benefit.

Despite the presence of hormone receptors in the epithelial component of some phyllodes tumors, the stromal component is the principle neoplastic cell population responsible for the metastatic behavior.

Most phyllodes tumors present as smooth, multinodular, painless breast lumps. While they can be confused for fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors typically have larger sizes and grow rapidly. Twenty percent of phyllodes tumors present as abnormal findings on screening mammography. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical appearance of a phyllodes tumor on mammography is a smooth, polylobulated mass. On ultrasound examination, these lesions are solid, hypoechoic, and well circumscribed. The presence of cystic areas within the mass may increase the level of suspicion for phyllodes tumors. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast masses suspicious for phyllodes tumors should undergo core biopsy; fine needle aspiration is less accurate. If the core biopsy results are indeterminate or if there is clinical-pathologic discordance, an excisional biopsy should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For phyllodes tumors of the breast, we recommend wide excision with a margin of at least 1 cm, rather than excision with narrower margins or enucleation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Positive margins require re-excision. We will accept a narrower but clear margin for benign, but not borderline or malignant, tumors. As long as adequate margins can be achieved, phyllodes tumors can often be treated with breast-conserving surgery (partial mastectomy). Mastectomy is only required if adequate margins cannot be achieved with breast-conserving surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend not performing axillary dissection for phyllodes tumors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For benign phyllodes tumors that are completely excised, we recommend not performing adjuvant radiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). For borderline or malignant phyllodes tumors, we suggest performing adjuvant radiotherapy, even after a complete excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Radiation therapy substantially reduces the local recurrence rates of these tumors. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy be reserved for highly selected patients with large, high-risk, or recurrent malignant phyllodes tumors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
