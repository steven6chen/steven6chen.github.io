Beta2-m is a component of the major histocompatibility complex that is present on cell surfaces and is normally cleared by glomerular filtration, with subsequent reabsorption and catabolism in proximal tubules. Clearance declines in patients with reduced kidney function, which leads to plasma accumulation and slow tissue deposition.</p><p>The prevalence of DRA has decreased with the use of high-flux biocompatible membranes, which provide better clearance of beta2-m and are less likely to induce reactive inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H2270360182\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>However, even these more modern hemodialysis therapies can be associated with retention of beta2-m. An overview of DRA is presented in this topic review. Other bone diseases and other complications associated with renal disease are discussed elsewhere.

Beta2-m amyloid also deposits in other tissues, especially blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>] and the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast to fragments of immunoglobulin light chains in primary amyloidosis and serum amyloid A in secondary amyloidosis, the amyloid protein in DRA is composed primarily of beta2-m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/2,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,14</a>].</p><p>Amyloid deposition results in the following common presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scapulohumeral periarthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexor tenosynovitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Destructive spondyloarthropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone cysts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visceral involvement, particularly the gastrointestinal tract</p><p/><p>The clinical presentation is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606530\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue deposition of beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) is due to reduced clearance and, possibly, to increased production. The major underlying cause is the inability of patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) to adequately clear beta2-m, even with modern, high-flux hemodialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> convective therapies. This is because continuous generation of beta2-m far exceeds its removal by these dialysis modalities. As an example, assuming steady beta2-m generation in a 70 kg anuric individual, net yearly beta2-m retention is 111, 97, 77, 53, and 51 grams with low-flux conventional hemodialysis, high-flux dialysis, short daily hemodialysis, nocturnal hemodialysis, and short daily hemofiltration, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In peritoneal dialysis, there is a small, daily removal of beta2-m due to the overall slow rate of convective transport and dialysate flow rate, despite the peritoneal membrane being highly permeable to small proteins. In one study, for example, clearance was significantly higher with high-flux hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis (29 versus 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/week</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, residual renal function is generally higher among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis; this may increase overall clearance of beta2-m. (See <a href=\"#H2270360269\" class=\"local\">'Lack of residual renal function'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to decreased clearance of beta2-m, the dialysis procedure itself (particularly via exposure to bioincompatible membranes) may mildly stimulate intradialytic beta2-m production. This was suggested by in vitro experiments that demonstrated increased beta2-m production by cultured peripheral blood monocytes obtained from hemodialysis patients after dialysis with a cuprophane membrane but not by monocytes from patients dialyzed with the more biocompatible, non-complement-activating polymethylmethacrylate membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Two mechanisms may contribute to the bioincompatible membrane-induced stimulation of beta2-m synthesis, including contact of the cells with the membrane and activation of late complement components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is also possible that dialysate contaminated with endotoxin stimulates the release of beta2-m from leukocytes and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The role of reactive inflammation is suggested by observations that lesions in which beta2-m amyloid is deposited are associated with a marked influx of activated macrophages expressing cytokines, such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These macrophages appear to be unable to adequately phagocytose deposited beta2-m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the destructive spondyloarthropathy may be mediated in part by amyloid deposition, an inability to adequately process such deposition, and reactive inflammation.</p><p>However, observational data suggest that intradialytic generation of beta2-m is not a significant underlying factor in DRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum levels of beta2-m are similar or higher in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis as with hemodialysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DRA has developed in patients who have never undergone hemodialysis</p><p/><p>Although sustained increase in serum beta2-m concentration is a prerequisite for formation of beta2-m amyloid fibrils, the exact mechanism of amyloidogenesis in dialysis patients remains unclear. Studies have shown that elevation of circulating beta2-m levels is not the only cause of DRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and other substances, such as glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, apolipoprotein E, and serum amyloid P component, may be involved with amyloidogenesis of patients with long-term dialysis treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These molecules are thought to stabilize the amyloid fibrils and inhibit their depolymerization. Moreover, at a neutral pH, lysophospholipids and nonesterified fatty acids accelerate amyloid fibril formation from beta2-m monomer and extension of amyloid fibrils in vitro and may enhance the amyloid deposition in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Glycosylated beta2-m, a modified microglobulin resulting from the activity of 3-deoxyglucose, has been found in amyloid deposits as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Since 3-deoxyglucose is present at increased levels in the serum of uremic and hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], the modification of beta2-m may occur more readily in renal failure. The presence of glycosylated beta2-m in amyloid deposits may further enhance the development of these lesions by both stimulating the secretion of cytokines and acting as a chemoattractant and an apoptosis-delaying agent for monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>The pathogenic effects of glycosylated beta2-m might be prevented by the administration of aminoguanidine, an agent that inhibits advanced glycation. The potential utility of aminoguanidine in DRA was suggested by an in vitro study that incubated beta2-m and D-glucose in the presence or absence of the agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Aminoguanidine resulted in a significant inhibition of the formation of AGEs on beta2-m. However, aminoguanidine has not been approved for human use by regulatory agencies and is not available to be administered to patients.</p><p>Beta2-m may cause bone destruction by directly stimulating formation of osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270360182\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of DRA is unknown since biopsy (which is the conclusive diagnostic test) is rarely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). The tissue deposition of amyloid that is detected histologically occurs much earlier than any clinical or radiographic manifestation of the illness. A prospective postmortem study found joint amyloid deposition in 21 percent of patients receiving hemodialysis for &lt;2 years, in 50 percent at 4 to 7 years, in 90 percent at 7 to 13 years, and in 100 percent at &gt;13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. By comparison, some centers have reported the clinical prevalence of the disease as 0 percent at 5 years, which increased to approximately 50 percent at 12 years and to almost 100 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, such data were largely obtained during periods when hemodialysis was performed with low-flux, cellulose-derived dialysis membranes that were impermeable to beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m). Although few data are available, DRA is considered to be much less frequent now that most hemodialysis is performed with high-flux dialyzer membranes or convective therapies associated with increased clearance of beta2-m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Indeed, one study that used Japan Renal Data Registries including 202,726 patients compared the incidence of first-time carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as proxy for DRA in two cohorts without a history of CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this population, the incidence of CTS decreased by almost half in 2010 compared with that in 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although the study was limited by the lack of histologic confirmation of amyloid deposits, the authors attributed the decreased prevalence of DRA to the greater use of both high-flux hemodialysis and ultrapure dialysis water.</p><p>The incidence of DRA in patients on peritoneal dialysis is even less clear since there are few patients who have been dialyzed for prolonged periods. Some observations suggest that peritoneal dialysis is associated with a similar risk of developing DRA as with hemodialysis, a finding that would be expected since there is limited removal of beta2-m by peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for DRA include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age and dialysis vintage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of low-flux dialysis membranes (see <a href=\"#H27375532\" class=\"local\">'Low-flux dialysis membrane'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of bioincompatible dialysis membrane (see <a href=\"#H2270360262\" class=\"local\">'Bioincompatible dialysis membrane'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of residual renal function (see <a href=\"#H2270360269\" class=\"local\">'Lack of residual renal function'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270361485\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and dialysis vintage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age and dialysis vintage are closely associated with DRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Virtually all studies have demonstrated increasing prevalence with time on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/2,7,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27375532\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-flux dialysis membrane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DRA is more common among patients who undergo low-flux dialysis compared with high-flux dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/7,16,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16,39,40</a>]. This is suggested by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One multicenter study that included 221 patients who were receiving hemodialysis for more than five years found that, among patients &gt;60 years of age at the start of dialysis, the likelihood of developing amyloid bone disease was five times higher with low-flux membranes compared with high-flux membranes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68848 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study, clinically evident DRA was compared among 89 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were maintained on regular hemodialysis for at least 10 years and treated exclusively with low-flux, bioincompatible cellulose membranes; low-flux, intermediately biocompatible polysulphone (PMMA) membranes; or high-flux, highly biocompatible polysulphone (AN69) membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Clearance of beta2-m by low-flux dialysis membranes is poor because the molecular weight of beta2-m (11,800 Da) is greater than the cut-off level of the membrane porosity. The more permeable membranes have an intrinsically greater rate of convective transport (although diffusion is limited by the size of the beta2-m molecule) and also may bind beta2-m directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270360262\"><span class=\"h2\">Bioincompatible dialysis membrane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DRA appears to be more common among patients who are dialyzed using a bioincompatible dialysis membrane than among those who are dialyzed using a highly biocompatible membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/39,40,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,50</a>].

However, removal of significant amounts of beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) may prevent or slow progression of the disease. This can be accomplished best by renal transplantation. However, hemodialysis with a biocompatible high-flux dialysis membrane, hemodiafiltration, the use of ultrapure dialysate, or a beta2-m adsorbent column may also result in lowering the level of beta2-m.</p><p>Renal transplantation is considered the definitive treatment for DRA in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Therefore, for patients with DRA who are appropriate candidates, we suggest renal transplantation since it provides the most effective reduction of beta2-m levels (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;</a>). Successful renal transplantation reduces plasma beta2-m levels to normal, and joint pains usually resolve soon after the renal allograft has begun to function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/5,94-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,94-97</a>]. Over time, after transplantation, the amyloid deposits may also regress. One study, for example, found regression of articular amyloid deposition in eight of nine patients with DRA, as detected by scanning with radiolabeled serum amyloid P component approximately five years after successful renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. In contrast, bone cysts resolve slowly after transplantation, and the destructive spondyloarthropathy continues to progress; symptoms generally recur quickly in patients who restart dialysis after renal graft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>].</p><p>However, many ESRD patients are not appropriate candidates for transplantation, because of comorbid conditions or advanced age. In addition, many patients who are appropriate candidates for transplantation do not have an available living donor and must wait for months to years for a deceased-donor kidney. For such patients, dialytic therapy should be optimized to provide maximum reduction of beta2-m. The effective removal of beta2-m by dialytic therapy requires the use of newer and more permeable dialysis membranes (for patients on hemodialysis) since cuprophan membranes are impermeable to beta2-m.</p><p>Moreover, the dialysis modality, duration, and frequency also influence the clearance of beta2-m.</p><p>There are few studies examining the relative efficacy of specific therapies in patients with established DRA. Most proposed interventions are based on studies showing increased beta2-m clearance.

However, there are insufficient data upon which to recommend their use at this time.</p><p>Among hemodialysis patients with DRA, we increase the dialysis duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequency.

Nocturnal hemodialysis (performed for eight hours, six nights per week at low blood and dialysate flow rates) is associated with significantly higher clearances of beta2-m (585 versus 127 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> and a greater reduction in plasma beta2-m concentrations (39 versus 21 percent) compared with conventional hemodialysis (performed for four hours, three times per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Significant removal of beta2-m occurs with hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration, although plasma beta2-m levels remain high with these modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/103-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-107</a>].

Some clinicians feel that hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration do not provide a clear benefit versus that associated with biocompatible high-flux hemodialysis performed at high blood flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Some studies suggested that the incidence of DRA is equal in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, while others suggest that its incidence and progression are greater in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/91,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,112</a>]. For example, an earlier study compared the incidence of CTS in populations of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with that in patients receiving hemodialysis populations. One-hundred fifty-one patients (90 patients on hemodialysis and 61 patients on CAPD) were evaluated by questionnaire, physical examination, and nerve conduction studies. Eight of 57 CAPD and 15 of 83 hemodialysis patients had CTS. The authors concluded that CTS occurs with equal frequency in CAPD and hemodialysis populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. However, a more recent study found significantly higher clearance of beta2-m with high-flux hemodialysis than with peritoneal dialysis (29 versus 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/week</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-related-amyloidosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is important to point out that such comparative studies have been limited by the shorter average duration of peritoneal dialysis.

The incidence of DRA is now much lower than had been reported previously, a trend that correlates with the increased use of high-flux biocompatible dialyzers with enhanced clearance of beta2-m. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H605240\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical manifestations of DRA are the characteristic triad of scapulohumeral periarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), and flexor tenosynovitis of the hand; rapidly enlarging bone cysts; destructive spondyloarthropathy; and pathologic fractures. The amyloid found in involved tissue is similar to other forms of amyloid in its staining properties, with Congo red, and in exhibiting apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Plain radiography often reveals bone cysts, especially near joints. The diagnosis of DRA is based upon the presence of typical clinical features with characteristic imaging findings. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once DRA has developed, patients should be dialyzed with biocompatible, high-flux hemodialysis membranes, which are the standard of therapy. In addition, altering the duration, frequency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> type of dialysis treatment may provide some benefit. Renal transplantation is the only modality that appears to slow or halt the progression of DRA. In patients with CTS, early surgical correction is warranted. Surgical treatment of diseased bones and joints with modalities such as open surgery, curettage, and total joint arthroplasty may result in dramatic pain relief, particularly in cases where debility or pain cannot be controlled with analgesics or other nonsurgical modalities. Although a beta 2-m adsorption column appeared to improve symptoms of DRA in Japanese dialysis patients, randomized, controlled trials are needed to substantiate the benefit of this modality.
