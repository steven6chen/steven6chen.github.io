This topic reviews the postoperative care and complications in children who have undergone adenoidectomy alone. Postoperative issues in children who have undergone tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy are discussed in greater detail separately. The indications, contraindications, and preoperative and intraoperative care for both procedures in children are also reviewed elsewhere.

Patients who undergo adenoidectomy alone are typically discharged home the same day as surgery. Exceptions include the presence of underlying comorbid conditions or if the child is &lt;2 years of age and has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is associated with increased risk of perioperative respiratory compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Surgical therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Pharyngeal pain from the surgical site and endotracheal intubation typically only requires nonnarcotic analgesics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, on an as-needed basis. A minority of patients may also have neck pain that may last for several days to a few weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Occasionally a child will complain of ear pain after surgery. The ear pain is referred from the pharynx and is treated with over-the-counter pain medications.</p><p>Many children will have significant halitosis that can last up to two weeks after surgery. The bad breath is a normal side effect of the surgery and resolves spontaneously.</p><p>There are no dietary restrictions following adenoidectomy and most children consume a normal diet within zero to two days following surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4248217\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant complications after adenoidectomy are uncommon in children. Postoperative hemorrhage almost always occurs in the first 24 hours following surgery rather than later. Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), nasopharyngeal stenosis, and atlantoaxial rotary subluxation are other rare potential complications of the surgery. Occasionally the adenoids regrow due to incomplete removal. Repeat adenoidectomy may be warranted if regrowth is significant enough to cause recurrence of symptoms. Very rarely, meningitis, cervical osteomyelitis, or brainstem injury may complicate adenoidectomy. Retropharyngeal injection of local anesthetic agents have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819841230\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding from the nose after adenoidectomy mostly occurs within the first 24 hours following surgery (called primary, early, or R1 hemorrhage), with rates similar to the lower end of that seen with tonsillectomy (around 0.5 to 0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Late or secondary hemorrhage is rare in children who have undergone adenoidectomy, and is much less common than after tonsillectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications#H7658129\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) in children: Postoperative care and complications&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819841244\"><span class=\"h2\">Velopharyngeal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VPI is characterized by hypernasal speech, nasal air emission, and nasal regurgitation of fluids in severe cases. It is a known complication of adenoidectomy with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 1200 to 1 in 1500 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. VPI is most commonly thought to occur due to the unmasking of a pre-existing palatal problem, such as a submucous or occult cleft palate. Removal of the adenoids increases the size of the nasopharyngeal airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The poorly functioning palate is no longer able to achieve nasopharyngeal closure with the adenoid tissue removed.</p><p>Often VPI is temporary and resolves within a few weeks of adenoidectomy surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. If hypernasality persists three months after adenoidectomy, further evaluation by a speech pathologist is indicated. VPI after adenoidectomy is associated with chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Testing for this genetic anomaly is suggested even if other clinical features of velocardiofacial syndrome are not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some children improve with speech therapy alone, while others require additional surgery to enable the child to close <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> velopharyngeal inlet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. In children with a known cleft palate or <span class=\"nowrap\">submucous/occult</span> cleft palate, performance of a partial superior adenoidectomy, in which a small amount of adenoidal tissue is left inferiorly to ensure adequate velopharyngeal closure, can reduce the chance of developing VPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].

This entity is characterized by significant narrowing or obliteration of the normal passage between the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Patients present with difficulty breathing through their nose, difficulty blowing air out their nose, hyponasal speech, and dysphagia. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic rhinorrhea, and anosmia may occur if the stenosis is severe.

The use of monopolar suction cautery during the adenoidectomy procedure is also a risk factor for Grisel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Children, particularly those with Down syndrome, have increased laxity of their cervical ligaments making them more susceptible to this disorder.

The incidence of repeated adenoidectomy due to recurrent nasal or otologic symptoms following initial adenoidectomy is estimated to be 0.55 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/1,30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30,32,33</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for repeated adenoidectomy include young age at the time of the original procedure, an otologic indication for adenoidectomy, the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy, and the need for multiple courses of antibiotics after the original surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35</a>].
