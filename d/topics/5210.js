In general, the diagnostic approach to catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) consists of clinical evaluation and microbiologic confirmation with separate blood cultures obtained from the catheter as well as a peripheral vein.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of CRBSI will be reviewed here. Issues related to treatment of CRBSI are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For surveillance purposes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has introduced the term laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (LCBI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. LCBI must meet at least one of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from one or more blood cultures, and the pathogen is not related to an infection at another site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (&gt;38.0&deg;C), chills, or hypotension, and the pathogen is not related to an infection at another site or, if the organism is a common commensal, it must be present from two or more blood cultures drawn on separate occasions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient &lt;1 year of age has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever, hypothermia, apnea, or bradycardia (in addition to above criteria).</p><p/><p>In addition, the CDC has also identified a subset of LCBI: mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (MBI-LCBI). This category consists of catheter infection in patients with at least one blood culture growing enteric organisms who are allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with advanced graft-versus-host disease, profound diarrhea, or neutropenia (&lt;500 white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span>.</p><p>For clinical purposes, the diagnosis of an intravenous catheter&ndash;related infection requires host, epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) should be suspected when bloodstream infection occurs in the setting of a central venous catheter with no other apparent source. Fever is the most sensitive clinical manifestation, although the specificity is poor. Inflammation or purulence at the insertion site has greater specificity but poor sensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55700\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55700 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Other clinical manifestations include hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, catheter dysfunction (as occurs with intraluminal clot), and clinical signs of sepsis that start abruptly after catheter infusion. Complications related to a bloodstream infection (such as suppurative thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, metastatic infection) may also be observed.</p><p>Blood cultures positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or <em>Candida</em> species in the absence of other identifiable sources of infection should increase the suspicion for CRBSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Clinical improvement within 24 hours following catheter removal is suggestive of CRBSI (but not sufficient for definitive diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Routine catheter removal is not necessary in the absence of microbiologic confirmation (positive blood cultures); catheter management is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Catheter management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures of blood and catheters should be pursued in the setting of clinical suspicion for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) based on the clinical manifestations described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood cultures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Specimen collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paired blood samples drawn from the catheter and a peripheral vein should be obtained for culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Among patients with renal insufficiency, collection of peripheral blood samples from vessels intended for future use in creating a dialysis fistula should be avoided. If a blood sample cannot be drawn from a peripheral vein, then blood can be drawn from different lumens of multilumen catheters. If this approach is pursued, &ge;2 blood samples should be drawn through catheter lumens at different times. Otherwise, evidence for drawing blood from each lumen of multilumen catheters for diagnosis of CRBSI is limited, and the practice is generally not needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>The same volume of blood should be inoculated into each bottle, and the bottles should be labeled to reflect the sites from which the cultures were obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;, section on 'Method for obtaining cultures'</a>.)</p><p>Cultures of blood samples obtained through catheters are associated with a higher rate of false-positive results than cultures of percutaneous blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Thus, the specificity and positive predictive value for culturing blood samples from peripheral veins are higher than for culturing blood samples obtained through catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Both types of samples are associated with excellent negative predictive values. Positive cultures obtained through catheters should be presumed to reflect true infection for circumstances in which peripheral blood samples cannot be obtained and there is no clinical evidence for an alternative source of infection.</p><p>A dedicated phlebotomy team can reduce the contamination rate of blood culture samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Use of alcohol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> and alcohol combinations (&gt;0.5 percent), or tincture of iodine for skin preparation is associated with lower rates of blood culture contamination than povidone-iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Chlorhexidine-based solutions appear to be superior to both aqueous and alcohol-based povidone-iodine in reducing the risk for catheter colonization and CRBSIs and is the preferred antiseptic of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. For samples obtained through a catheter, the catheter hub should be cleaned with alcohol, chlorhexidine and alcohol, or tincture of iodine. Adequate time for drying should be allowed to mitigate blood culture contamination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of CRBSI requires establishing the presence of bloodstream infection and demonstrating that the infection is related to the catheter (eg, there are no alternative sources for bacteremia). Microbiologic confirmation of CRBSI may be made based on blood cultures obtained prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy meeting one of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture of the same organism from both the catheter tip and at least one percutaneous blood culture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture of the same organism from at least two blood samples (one from a catheter hub and the other from a peripheral vein or second lumen) meeting criteria for quantitative blood cultures or differential time to positivity. Most laboratories do not perform quantitative blood cultures, but many laboratories are able to determine differential time to positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. These are discussed below.</p><p/><p>Quantitative blood cultures demonstrating a colony count from the catheter hub sample &ge;3-fold higher than the colony count from the peripheral vein sample (or a second lumen) supports a diagnosis of CRBSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. Semiquantitative cultures demonstrating &gt;15 colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFU)/mL</span> of the same microbe from the insertion site, hub site, and peripheral blood culture also supports a diagnosis of CRBSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Differential time to positivity (DTP) refers to growth detected from the catheter hub sample at least two hours before growth detected from the peripheral vein sample. Sensitivity and specificity for this technique are very good (85 and 91 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>It is critical that blood cultures include at least one sample drawn from a peripheral vein, although in young children obtaining peripheral blood cultures may be difficult or impossible. If feasible, at least two sets of blood cultures should be drawn from peripheral veins by separate venipuncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Blood cultures should not be drawn solely from the catheter port as these are frequently colonized with skin contaminants, thereby increasing the likelihood of a false-positive blood culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/14,15,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,31,32</a>]. Among 130 matched peripheral vein and catheter blood cultures, the catheter specimen was the only positive culture in 25 cases, nearly all of which were determined to represent contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Negative blood cultures drawn through a catheter have excellent negative predictive value, however.</p><p>In the setting of a single positive blood culture positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci, repeat blood samples should be obtained for culture prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy, both through the suspected catheter and from a peripheral vein (to be certain that the patient has true bloodstream infection and that the catheter is the likely source).</p><p>In the setting of positive catheter-drawn blood cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci or gram-negative bacilli and negative concurrent percutaneous blood cultures, an intraluminally colonized catheter may be present. As such, there may be an increased risk for subsequent CRBSI in these patients, especially if the device is left in place. In such circumstances, we favor following the patient closely and obtaining additional percutaneous blood cultures if the patient continues to exhibit clinical manifestations of CRBSI. However, some clinicians may prefer to remove the device or exchange it over a guide wire. Alternatively, antibiotic lock therapy (without systemic therapy) may be administered if removal is not feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Catheter colonization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic lock therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter cultures should be performed when a catheter is removed for suspected CRBSI if appropriate testing can be performed in the local microbiology laboratory. There is no role for routine catheter cultures in the absence of clinical suspicion for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/20,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,33</a>].</p><p>Central venous catheters should be evaluated by culturing the tip (rather than the subcutaneous segment) if the device has been in place for at least 7 to 10 days. Central venous catheters in place for &lt;7 to 10 days should have the intradermal portion cultured as the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is most likely due to infection of the catheter wound. However, if the catheter is an implanted device the tip should be cultured even if the device has been in place &lt;10 days. Qualitative broth culture of catheter tips is not recommended; catheter colonization is established by the following quantitative definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semiquantitative broth culture growth of &gt;15 CFU from a 5 cm segment of the catheter tip by roll-plate culture.

In general, positive catheter tip culture for other pathogens does not warrant antibiotic therapy for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'S. aureus'</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary artery catheters should be evaluated by culturing the introducer (rather than the catheter itself) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Venous access subcutaneous ports should be evaluated by qualitative culture of the material inside the port reservoir in addition to catheter tip culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Catheter tips with antimicrobial coating (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>) should best be cultured with specific inhibitors in the culture media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Unfortunately, many of these techniques are not practical for most hospitals due to technical issues and the extensive amount of labor involved.</p><p>Various methods have been used to diagnose catheter-related infection without catheter removal. In one method, a moist cotton swab was used to do a semiquantitative culture of a 3 cm radius around the insertion site, and alginate swabs were used to swab the inner surface of each catheter hub. Growth of &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/plate</span> of the same microbe from the insertion site, hub site, and peripheral blood culture was suggestive of a CRBSI using their definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Additional studies of this noninvasive technique are needed to validate the findings.</p><p>In the setting of catheter site exudate, swabs of the drainage material should be sent for gram stain and culture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive diagnosis of CRBSI in children is difficult. Insufficient blood samples may reduce the negative predictive of the culture, and only blood samples obtained via the catheter may be available to guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Therefore, such cases may need to be managed as presumed CRBSI.
