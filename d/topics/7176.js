These can be used in a variety of surgical situations. However, there are no reliable guidelines about when fibrin sealants are best used or which products are optimal for specific indications. </p><p>The use of fibrin sealants is reviewed here. The use of other topical hemostatic agents and tissue adhesives or sealants, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombin-topical-human-and-bovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical thrombin</a> as a single-component topical agent, is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissues adhesives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472785937\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The search for the perfect operative sealant began in the first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. By the 1940s, fibrinogen and thrombin were combined in operative settings. Once Cohn fractionation led to the ability to generate highly concentrated fibrinogen preparations (in the 1960s), fibrin sealants were used to promote wound healing, skin grafting, and dural sealing; to provide hemostasis in microvascular surgery and parenchymal injury; and to serve as a matrix for bony chips and fragments in the repair of bone defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Fibrin sealants simulate the final stage of the clotting cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81428\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81428 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fibrin sealants are a two-component system comprised of a solution of concentrated fibrinogen and factor XIII that is combined with a solution of thrombin and calcium to form a coagulum. Once combined, a fibrin clot forms in seconds, or somewhat more slowly if a more diluted form of thrombin is used. Because fibrin sealants have fibrinogen concentrations that are higher than physiologic concentrations at the site of bleeding (particularly for commercial preparations), clot formation with fibrin sealants is faster than the native coagulation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The contribution of flow to clot retraction was discovered using a microfluidic device capable of flowing human blood over a side channel plugged with collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This device was used in one study to measure thrombus permeability and contraction in the presence of platelet binding to collagen alone or in the presence of thrombin and fibrinogen. Collagen supported formation of a 20-micrometer thick platelet layer, which retracted significantly upon cessation of flow but resulted in a 5.34-fold increase in permeability because of reconfiguration of the supporting collagen. The presence of thrombin and fibrinogen allowed isotropic contraction of platelets, creating an impermeable clot. Although not the purpose of this study, these results would seem to predict that applying a combination of thrombin and fibrinogen promotes a more hemostatic clot than using a collagen alone as a mechanical barrier to flow. </p><p>Different fibrin sealants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>) have different adhesive properties. In one study, the tensile strengths of four different fibrin sealants were measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Tisseel/Tissucol</span> provided the best adhesion of a small wooden cylinder to liver cross-section in a canine model of hepatectomy. (See <a href=\"#H2858223044\" class=\"local\">'Formulations and use'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrin sealant preparations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>) contain fibrinogen, thrombin, and other components such as ionized calcium, as a coagulation protein cofactor, factor XIII, fibronectin, and often, but not always, an antifibrinolytic agent (eg, aprotinin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrinogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrinogen, which provides the adhesive and hemostatic capabilities of fibrin sealant, is the most important component. The tensile or adhesive strength of the sealant correlates directly with the fibrinogen concentration, but the presence of activated platelets, which generate contractile force through actin and myosin II fibers, increases contractile <span class=\"nowrap\">force/area</span> to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">dynes/cm<sup>2</sup></span> compared with less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">dynes/cm<sup>2</sup></span> in a platelet-free clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Commercial preparations have the major advantage over locally prepared (operating room or blood bank) fibrin sealants in that they have a highly concentrated fibrinogen component that is more uniform. As an example, both Tisseel and Evicel have fibrinogen concentrations of 70 and 55 to 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], compared with 2.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> for cryoprecipitate (unmanipulated). Other published methods for producing sealant generate fibrinogen levels intermediate between the cryoprecipitated and lyophilized methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate#H933090127\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of Cryoprecipitate&quot;, section on 'Constituents'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombin is the other important component of fibrin sealant preparations. The rapidity of the clot formation and the tensile strength of the fibrin seal are related to the concentration of thrombin. Thrombin also activates factor XIII, which facilitates the bonding of the fibrin polymer and helps stabilize the clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When rapid clot formation (5 to 10 seconds) is desired, thrombin concentrations of 500 to 1000 NIH units should be used (eg, Tisseel; 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL,</span> Evicel; 800 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If slower clot formation is desirable (eg, in plastic surgery procedures when close approximation of tissues is sought), thrombin concentrations of 4 to 10 NIH units should be used (eg, Artiss; 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Virtually all earlier fibrin sealant preparations used <strong>bovine</strong> thrombin, but this has largely been supplanted by <strong>human</strong> thrombin in currently available preparations. In addition to other benefits, use of human thrombin eliminates acquired factor V deficiency (and concomitant bleeding diathesis) that occasionally results when patients make antibodies to bovine factor V (a common contaminant of bovine thrombin) that cross-react with endogenous factor V to produce a functional deficiency of that clotting factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;, section on 'Thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;, section on 'Factor V inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>A recombinant human thrombin preparation has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Results from eight clinical trials have indicated that this preparation is well tolerated in numerous surgical settings when used as a topical adjunct to hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Less than 1 percent of the patients developed antibodies to human recombinant thrombin; these antibodies did not neutralize native human thrombin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contributions of the other components are important, although in some cases controversial. Ionized calcium is critical to the action of thrombin. Factor XIII, or fibrin stabilizing factor, is felt by some to be important in the fibrin crosslinking that determines the sealant's breaking strength or mechanical properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,20</a>]. Fortunately, most methods of preparation that isolate fibrinogen also generate adequate amounts of factor XIII.</p><p>In some preparations, or for selected indications, an antifibrinolytic agent (eg, aprotinin) is also included, presumably to prevent lysis of the clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Chromatographic filtering techniques can also be used to reduce the amount of plasminogen in the product, eliminating the need for an antifibrinolytic. However, antifibrinolytic agents may or may not be desirable. For certain anatomic sites (eg, the middle ear), rapid lysis of the sealant is considered essential. For this indication, antifibrinolytic agents, which can promote a tissue seal lasting three to four weeks rather than several days, would be less useful. On the other hand, for surgical procedures on tissues that have high levels of fibrinolysins (eg, prostate, lung, uterus), antifibrinolytic agents would be a valuable adjunct. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2552264044\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrin sealants made from donor plasma or cryoprecipitate should not be used in patients with a history of prior anaphylactic reactions to plasma products or in those with IgA deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives#H2492744070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissues adhesives&quot;, section on 'Anaphylaxis'</a>.) </p><p>Fibrin sealants should never be injected intravenously or allowed to enter cell saver or cardiopulmonary bypass circuits because of the risks of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage#H402651091\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;, section on 'Potential complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2858223044\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMULATIONS AND USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited regarding the comparative efficacy of topical hemostatic agents in clinical practice. We prefer to use a commercially prepared fibrin sealant because of its ease and timeliness of use and reliable action. When not available, a cryoprecipitate-based preparation can be used. </p><p>Some of the fibrin sealant products (eg, Tisseel, Beriplast, Biocol) have been used extensively in Europe for over 30 years. During much of this time, these products were not commercially available in the United States due to the reluctance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve fibrinogen prepared from pooled human plasma, given the previously demonstrated increased risk of hepatitis transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. American surgeons relied on cryoprecipitate-based preparations until the first commercial fibrin sealant (ie, Tisseel) was approved for use in the United States in 1998.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4289900161\"><span class=\"h2\">Commercially prepared</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercially prepared fibrin sealant products are most commonly used in liquid form (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>). Commercially available patches (eg, TachoSil, Veriset, Evarrest) and pads (eg, Fibrin Pad) that are composed of fibrin sealant combined with other hemostatic agents (eg, polyglactin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxidized-regnerated-cellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxidized regenerated cellulose</a>) are in the early stages of clinical investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. A recombinant fibrinogen in a dry formulation is also under study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. A spray-dried fibrin sealant is also available (Raplixa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Solvent (tri-n-butyl phosphate) detergent (Tween 80; ie, S-D) treatment of pooled plasma results in a fibrin sealant with predictable and measurable <span class=\"nowrap\">hemostatic/adhesive</span> qualities and minimal infectious disease risk, as this treatment inactivates lipid-enveloped viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. One pooled human plasma fibrin sealant (Artiss) incorporates S-D treatment of the pooled human plasma that provides the source of the fibrinogen in its system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One of the S-D plasma products (Octaplas) is used primarily in Europe; however, due to cost, it is not widely used in the United States. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryoprecipitate-based</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoprecipitate prepared from a single (autologous or allogeneic) donor most often serves as the fibrinogen source when commercially prepared fibrin sealants are not available or prohibited by cost. </p><p>In spite of its low (and variable) fibrinogen content, cryoprecipitate remains in use because it is readily available in most communities, needs little handling after preparation, and has the low infectious disease risk of a single-donor component. When time for planning is available, autologous cryoprecipitate can be prepared, virtually eliminating any infectious disease risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Preparation of fibrin sealant from platelet-rich or platelet-poor plasma harvested in the operating room at the start of surgery has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], and a commercial product (Vitagel) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006. </p><p>Vitagel comes as a kit containing bovine collagen and thrombin as well as the materials required to obtain plasma from the patient's blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Clinical trials in cardiac, hepatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], general surgical, and orthopedic patients have led to its broad regulatory approval for surgical hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Concern about the potential immune-mediated coagulopathy associated with bovine thrombin and the labor-intensive collection and separation of donor plasma are impediments to widespread adoption. </p><p>At institutions with special interest in fibrin sealant, alternative preparations including twice-precipitated, or twice-centrifuged, or chemically modified (ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol [PEG]-precipitated) cryoprecipitate to enhance the fibrinogen concentration of the final product have been evaluated. Also, an alternative product dubbed &quot;French&quot; glue, containing a gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde mixture, has been shown (in an animal model) to have excellent adhesive qualities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Application in the operating room</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrin sealant is applied very much like epoxy glue, using a two-syringe technique. When the two components <span class=\"nowrap\">(fibrinogen/factor</span> XII and <span class=\"nowrap\">thrombin/calcium)</span> are mixed together, a fibrin clot forms quickly at the application site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In some preparations, an antifibrinolytic agent is included to prevent lysis of the clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/1,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,22</a>]. For the various commercial products, we suggest adhering to the instructions for use contained within the packaging insert.</p><p>Commercially available preparations consist of a combination plunger, side-by-side syringes, and a dual needle-tip to facilitate even application of each component. The two components are applied simultaneously using a two-syringe technique. Tisseel and Evicel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>) come fully mixed and assembled in dual-syringe applicators. Prior to use, the frozen product must be thawed completely, which takes approximately 15 minutes. </p><p>When allogeneic or autologous cryoprecipitate is used as the source of fibrinogen, application devices are commercially available that contain all the essential components (side-by-side syringes, Y-connector and tubing, needle-tip or spray applicator). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cryoprecipitate-based'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the operating room, the <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrinogen/factor</span> XIII source (eg, cryoprecipitate) is thawed, if necessary, and drawn into one syringe, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">thrombin/calcium</span> drawn into the other.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the clinical application (eg, suture line stabilization versus achieving hemostasis of a diffusely oozing surface), one would select either the needle-tip or the spray applicator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the appropriate time, the contents of the syringes are simultaneously expressed and allowed to mix (in a 1:1 ratio) in either a concentrated or aerosol form, proceed to fibrin generation, and achieve hemostasis.</p><p/><p>Fibrin <span class=\"nowrap\">sealants/glue</span> preparations can also be used in laparoscopy but require a long dual-lumen applicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. The application is frequently complicated by obstruction of the applicator tip.

Although many early studies were anecdotal or lacking a reasonable control group, it appeared that fibrin sealant systems were effective for controlling slowly bleeding foci, diffuse oozing, bleeding from needle puncture sites, lymphatic leaks, serous fluid collections, and diffuse parenchymal organ hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p>Most fibrin sealant products shorten bleeding times in both animal and human studies, but there is little information linking the use of these products to improved patient outcomes. In the absence of an ideal measure of the effectiveness for topical hemostatic agents, attainment of hemostasis within 10 minutes of application has been the standard measure for product approval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/4,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,47</a>]. Other outcome measures used include operating room time, transfusion rates, and overall cost of care for surgical admissions. </p><p>Virtually every surgical discipline has found an application for fibrin sealant. Depending upon the nature of the surgery, fibrin sealant is utilized primarily for either its hemostatic, sealant, or adhesive properties. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1133136291\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrin sealant has been used to control bleeding in a variety of surgical applications (suture hole bleeding, bleeding from raw surfaces). The use of fibrin sealants appears to reduce the need for transfusion, though the effect varies widely depending upon the type of surgery. In a systematic review, the proportion of patients receiving transfusion was reduced (relative risk 0.40, 95% CI 0.26-0.61; five trials with 275 subjects), as was overall blood loss (weighted mean difference [WMD] -151.68 mL, 95% CI -251.91 to -51.46; seven trials with 391 subjects) and the number of units of blood transfused (WMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Because the process of clot formation with fibrin sealant is independent of earlier steps in the coagulation cascade, fibrin sealants remain effective in patients with coagulation defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrin-sealants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The use of fibrin sealants for hemostasis has been studied in the listed clinical scenarios.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissues adhesives&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin sealant preparations are a two-component system comprised mainly of a solution of concentrated fibrinogen and factor XIII, which is combined with a solution of thrombin and calcium, to form a coagulum. Clot formation with fibrin sealants is faster than the native coagulation process. Some commercial preparations include an anti-fibrinolytic agent (eg, aprotinin) to aid in clot stabilization. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Components'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The tensile or adhesive strength of the sealant correlates directly with the fibrinogen concentration. Commercial fibrin sealant preparations have a highly concentrated fibrinogen component that is more uniform compared with cryoprecipitate-derived preparations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rapidity of the clot formation as well as tensile strength are also related to the concentration of thrombin. Higher concentrations of thrombin (500 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span> should be used if rapid clot formation (5 to 10 seconds) is desired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the nature of the surgery, fibrin sealants are used primarily for their hemostatic, sealant, or adhesive properties. Fibrin sealants can also be used in laparoscopy but require a long dual-lumen applicator. (See <a href=\"#H2858223044\" class=\"local\">'Formulations and use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no reliable guidelines about when fibrin sealants are best used or which products are optimal for specific indications. The choice of fibrin sealant should be based on the individual's preference, experience, cost, and institutional or hospital acceptance. Fibrin sealants do appear to be effective hemostatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adhesive agents capable, in some settings, of contributing to a decrease in allogeneic blood exposure, but there is little information linking the use of these products to improved patient outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H1501536883\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of topical hemostatic agents, including fibrin sealants, include <span class=\"nowrap\">air/gas</span> embolism, hypotension, wound healing problems, the potential for blood-borne disease, and immune-mediated coagulopathy.
