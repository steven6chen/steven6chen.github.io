During aerosol-generating procedures, each healthcare worker should wear an N95 respirator (or an equivalent respirator such as a powered air purifying respirator). In addition to the use of N95 (or equivalent) respirators in HCWs performing aerosol-generating procedures, additional measures should be taken such as conducting procedures in an airborne infection isolation room when feasible and limiting the number of healthcare personnel present during the procedure.

N95 respirators fit tightly and filter out small particles. However, the optimal use of N95 respirators requires fit testing, training, and medical clearance. Furthermore, it is not clear that N95 respirators are more efficacious than facemasks in preventing influenza since the latter are able to filter large droplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-control-measures-to-prevent-seasonal-influenza-in-healthcare-settings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>During the 2009 to 2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the CDC and the Institute of Medicine recommended the use of fit-tested N95 respirators for healthcare personnel in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-control-measures-to-prevent-seasonal-influenza-in-healthcare-settings/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

Recommendations regarding infection control measures for seasonal influenza infection in healthcare settings have been provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All healthcare workers (HCWs) should be vaccinated against seasonal influenza annually. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America endorse a policy in which annual influenza vaccination is a condition of employment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> professional privileges for healthcare workers. (See <a href=\"#H8290432\" class=\"local\">'Immunization of healthcare workers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is particularly important that HCWs who are at increased risk for influenza complications be vaccinated annually against influenza; such individuals should also be treated early if influenza infection develops. (See <a href=\"#H8292207\" class=\"local\">'HCWs at increased risk for complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A range of administrative policies and practices should be used to minimize influenza exposures in healthcare settings, particularly during periods of increased influenza activity. (See <a href=\"#H8292095\" class=\"local\">'General steps to minimize exposures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precautions to prevent the spread of influenza infections in healthcare facilities include the use of standard and droplet precautions when caring for patients infected with influenza virus. Facemasks should be used for the routine care of patients with suspected or confirmed influenza infection, and N95 respirators (or an equivalent respirator) should be used during aerosol-generating procedures (See <a href=\"#H7867242\" class=\"local\">'Isolation precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visitor access to patients in isolation for influenza should generally be limited to individuals who are necessary for the patient&rsquo;s care and well-being. (See <a href=\"#H8292076\" class=\"local\">'Managing visitor access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCWs with fever and respiratory symptoms should not report to work or, if already at work, should stop patient care activities, wear a facemask, and promptly notify their supervisor and infection control. (See <a href=\"#H8292229\" class=\"local\">'Ill healthcare workers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional details about infection control measures to prevent influenza in healthcare settings can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/healthcaresettings.htm&amp;token=CJC1KXZ9L2C9nRXIqeyY+a/A29Mj1sP5WTPaH/2rMfDDj57+hv8kZnEIftlG6vtwAaEhTr6m5kpaE4D+NSFPkjhyOs8Z9YwkNqqJKs0uRHo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6999\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC's website</a>.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-control-measures-to-prevent-seasonal-influenza-in-healthcare-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Uyeki TM. 2009 H1N1 virus transmission and outbreaks.
