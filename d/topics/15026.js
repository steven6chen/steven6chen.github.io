Although there are remarkably few reports of treatment failures with ciprofloxacin in the United States, this drug is not regarded as a &quot;respiratory fluoroquinolone&quot;; ciprofloxacin is not recommended for treatment of respiratory infections by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) or the American Thoracic Society (ATS).

The principal enzymes involved are gyrase and topoisomerase IV, more specifically, two subunits of gyrase, <em>gyrA</em> and <em>gyrB</em>, and two subunits of topoisomerase IV, <em>parC</em> and <em>parE</em>. By binding these sites, fluoroquinolones block enzymatic activity such that bacterial replication cannot take place. The specific site of action of a quinolone is determined by the avidity with which it binds each enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-the-fluoroquinolones-doxycycline-and-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> binds exclusively with topoisomerase IV, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> binds more avidly with topoisomerase IV and also binds gyrase. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Moxifloxacin</a> reacts more strongly with gyrase. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gemifloxacin</a> binds avidly with both.</p><p>Fluoroquinolone resistance in <em>S. pneumoniae</em> generally occurs when several mutations in <em>gyrA</em> or <em>parC </em>reduce binding of the drug to the site of activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-the-fluoroquinolones-doxycycline-and-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Occasionally, mutations in <em>parE</em> are responsible. Resistance is stepwise; single mutations generally have little effect, but the more mutations that have occurred, the more resistant an organism is likely to be. In general, isolates with mutations in parC only are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> but not to the other quinolones, whereas isolates with mutations in gyrA only and isolates with mutations in both parC and gyrA tend to be resistant to all fluoroquinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-the-fluoroquinolones-doxycycline-and-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
