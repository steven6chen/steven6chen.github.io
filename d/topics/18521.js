The most common adverse reaction, the &quot;red man syndrome&quot; (RMS), is a rate-dependent infusion reaction, not a true allergic reaction.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> hypersensitivity will be reviewed here. Other antibiotics that commonly cause hypersensitivity reactions include the beta-lactam antibiotics and sulfonamides, and hypersensitivity reaction to these drugs are discussed separately.

In contrast, oral administration of vancomycin in subjects with Clostridium difficile infections does not usually result in systemic absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, for some patients, especially those with impaired renal function or other abnormalities, oral administration can lead to detectable serum levels of the medication and RMS to oral vancomycin may be possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RMS is characterized by flushing, erythema, and pruritus, usually affecting the upper body, neck, and face more than the lower body. Pains and muscle spasms in the back and chest, dyspnea, and hypotension may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Otherwise unexplained hypotension has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>RMS is rarely life threatening, although severe cardiovascular toxicity and even cardiac arrest can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis can present with symptoms similar or identical to those of severe RMS, and clinicians should be mindful of this alternative diagnosis. Unlike RMS, an IgE-mediated reaction to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> does not occur with initial administration, but instead requires sensitization to develop from a previous course of vancomycin. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'IgE-mediated anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RMS is a form of pseudoallergic drug reaction, which is an adverse drug reaction with signs and symptoms that mimic immunologic drug allergies, in which immunologic mechanisms have not been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p>Studies in animals indicate that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> directly activates mast cells, resulting in release of vasoactive mediators, such as histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In several human studies, the degree of elevation in serum histamine was related to the clinical severity of RMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, in other studies, increased serum histamine concentrations did not predict RMS and RMS occurred without detectable elevations in plasma histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], suggesting either that other mediators may be involved or that plasma histamine is not a sufficiently sensitive marker for mast cell activation localized to the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Relationship to infusion rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RMS is usually a rate-related infusion reaction as illustrated by the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/10,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 10 healthy presurgical patients received rapid infusions of 1 gram of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> over 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All developed RMS, seven had severe cutaneous reactions, and five had a reduction in blood pressure of 20 percent or more, necessitating discontinuation of the infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 10 adult male volunteers, the incidence and severity of RMS following the infusion of 1 gram of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> over either one or two hours was compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Eight subjects developed RMS (two severe, three moderate, and three mild) with the one-hour infusion compared with three (all mild) with the two-hour infusion. However, two studies with a total of 62 hospitalized patients with serious infections found a much lower risk of RMS (less than 10 percent) following 1 gram infused over one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p/><p>To avoid RMS, it has been suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> should be infused at a rate no higher than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span> or for a one gram dose, over a minimum of 100 minutes (whichever results in a slower infusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells are more easily activated when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> is given in combination with certain other medications. The combination of vancomycin and opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) enhances dose- or rate-related mast cell degranulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Adverse reactions can occur following administration of vancomycin in patients being treated with an opioid, or following the administration of opioids in patients being treated with vancomycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Similar interactions can occur between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> and radiocontrast dye, some muscle relaxants used in general anesthesia, and any other agents that potentiate mast cell degranulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74197 \">table 1</a>). Thus, when possible, these agents should <strong>not</strong> be administered simultaneously or in close approximation with vancomycin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of initial reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Empiric premedication to prevent RMS is not usually necessary for patients who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> for the first time at standard rates of infusion (&le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min)</span>. We generally do not administer premedication for doses &le;500 mg given over one hour, or doses of 500 mg to 1 gram, given over two hours. However, we advise even slower rates of infusion for patients who are also receiving opioids or other medications that predispose to mast cell activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74197 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing medications'</a> above.)</p><p>In contrast, empiric premedication with antihistamines <strong>is</strong> commonly employed if more rapid infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> are required in emergency or presurgical settings. Pretreatment with antihistamines reduces the incidence and severity of RMS, although the optimal regimen has not been determined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of 33 patients found that pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> (50 mg orally) completely prevented RMS in a group of patients receiving 1 gram of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> over 60 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Reactions occurred in 47 percent of the placebo group, compared with none in the diphenhydramine group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of very rapid infusions (1 gram over 10 minutes) in 30 presurgical patients, oral premedication with both H1 and H2 antihistamines was given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Subjects received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> (&le;1 mg per kg) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> (&le;4 mg per kg) one hour before infusion. The incidence and severity of RMS were significantly lower in the antihistamine-treated group, although one antihistamine-treated patient had intolerable itching and could not complete the infusion. Hypotension did not occur in the antihistamine group, but developed in 50 percent of patients in the placebo group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same investigators performed another randomized trial in 40 patients, using the same medications, doses, and setting as in the previous trial, although the antihistamine premedications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>) were administered intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients treated with an antihistamine had significantly lower rates of hypotension (11 versus 63 percent) and cutaneous findings (63 versus 100 percent). Itching was severe enough in two antihistamine-treated patients to necessitate discontinuation of the infusion.</p><p/><p>Based upon these limited data, premedication with H1 alone may be sufficient to prevent RMS following mildly increased rates of infusion, although even the combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines did not completely prevent RMS following very rapid infusions (1 gram over 10 minutes) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. Oral and intravenous antihistamine premedications appear to be similarly efficacious.</p><p>We suggest empiric premedication for patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> at high rates of infusion (more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span> or 1 gram over one hour). Oral antihistamines are preferred when possible. Although H1 antihistamines may be sufficient for mildly increased infusion rates, we suggest administration of both an H1 and H2 antihistamine to minimize the likelihood of a reaction if significantly faster rates are used (eg, 1 gram over 10 minutes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of acute RMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal management of RMS has not been evaluated in randomized trials. The approach outlined herein is based upon the author's clinical experience.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mild to moderate reactions (eg, the patient is uncomfortable due to flushing or pruritus, but hemodynamically stable and not experiencing chest pain or muscle spasm), we typically interrupt the infusion and treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> (50 mg orally or intravenously) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> (50 mg intravenously). Symptoms usually subside promptly. The infusion can then be restarted at one-half the original rate or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min,</span> whichever is slower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severe reactions (eg, involving muscle spasm, chest pain, or hypotension), we stop the infusion, treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> (50 mg intravenously) as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> (50 mg intravenously), and, if hypotension is present, intravenous fluids. Once symptoms have resolved, the infusion can be restarted, and given over four or more hours. For future doses in such patients, we suggest repeat premedication with antihistamines before each dose and infusion over four hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It may be difficult or impossible to distinguish severe RMS from anaphylaxis, as discussed below. Flushing and hypotension are features of both reactions. Hives, laryngeal edema, and wheezing are suggestive of anaphylaxis, and patients with these signs and symptoms should be treated with intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, in addition to the measures above. Overviews of the treatment of anaphylaxis in adults and in children (with specific medication doses) are provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 3</a>). Infusions must <strong>not </strong>be restarted if anaphylaxis is suspected, because slowing the rate and administering premedications will not prevent IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'IgE-mediated anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Following RMS of any severity, the patient's medication list should be reviewed to determine if other predisposing medications (eg, opioids) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74197 \">table 1</a>) can be identified and discontinued, before restarting the infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals experience recurrent and persistent symptoms, despite premedication and slower infusion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/11,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,20</a>]. These individuals may have mast cell <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils that are easily activated. Patients with mast cell disorders are particularly prone to RMS with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>.

Unfortunately, serum and skin tests cannot reliably discriminate between these two reactions.

However, this study examined blood samples collected 10 minutes after infusion, and may have missed later elevations. In addition, tryptase is not consistently elevated in drug-induced anaphylaxis either, and tryptase levels have not been measured in reports of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> anaphylaxis specifically.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322927\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> has not been validated, and the positive and negative predictive value of the results is not known. However, isolated case reports described reactions that were highly suggestive of IgE-mediated drug allergy, in which skin test results were positive. As an example, one patient developed generalized urticaria and respiratory distress after several doses of vancomycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-hypersensitivity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p>These reports suggest that skin testing with appropriate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> concentrations may reflect clinical reactivity and provide supportive evidence for the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. A positive skin test at concentrations of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or lower is strongly suggestive of drug allergy, in the setting of an appropriate clinical history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of alternate medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other antimicrobial agents should be considered for patients who have experienced very severe symptoms in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. Some patients receive vancomycin because of a reported history of allergy to penicillins, yet penicillin may be a superior antibiotic for certain infections, such as native valve endocarditis due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.

We suggest a combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Desensitization involves gradually reintroducing the culprit drug in serially increasing doses to induce a state of temporary clinical tolerance. There are several published protocols. We prefer a rapid protocol that allows the patient to receive a full dose of vancomycin within several hours.
