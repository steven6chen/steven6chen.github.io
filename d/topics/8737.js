In a 2013 meta-analysis that included 13 randomized trials (n = 1211), there was no significant difference in clinical remission rates, clinical improvement, or steroid-sparing effect in patients treated with AZA or 6-MP as compared with placebo. However, these results may be attributable to the slow onset of action of AZA or 6-MP. When remission or clinical improvement was measured before 17 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between AZA or 6-MP and placebo. However, when evaluated at 17 weeks or later, patients treated with AZA or 6-MP were significantly more likely to be in clinical remission as compared with placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.05-2.41).</p><p>In the same meta-analysis, there was no significant difference in the induction of steroid-free remission between AZA or 6-MP as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. The induction of steroid-free remission was significantly lower with AZA as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> (33 versus 44 percent). </p><p>In two trials, early introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> in the course of Crohn disease was investigated. In one open label trial, introduction of azathioprine within six months of diagnosis was not more effective than conventional step-up therapy to achieve disease remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulator-therapy-in-crohn-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, in a randomized trial in which 30 patients with a recent (&lt;8 weeks) diagnosis of Crohn disease were assigned to early azathioprine therapy or placebo, early azathioprine was not associated with an improvement in sustained glucocorticoid-free remission at 76 weeks, but was more effective in preventing moderate to severe relapse in a post hoc analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulator-therapy-in-crohn-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In addition, several questions remain unanswered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimum effective dose (or whether leukopenia is needed) for inducing remission is unknown. The observation that higher doses are more effective for maintaining remission suggests that a dose-response relationship probably also exists for the induction of remission (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of remission'</a> below). In one study, AZA was increased in 40 patients with active disease from 2.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily to 2.72 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily in one to four increments of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily, and patients were followed over six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulator-therapy-in-crohn-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The studies differed in their inclusion criteria (with or without steroids, prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> therapy) and outcome measures.

The rate of remission maintenance was higher in patients receiving active treatment compared to patients who discontinued maintenance therapy with azathioprine or 6-MP. In terms of absolute benefit, approximately four to six patients would need long-term maintenance therapy to maintain remission in one patient. The maintenance of remission was dose-dependent for azathioprine. Patients receiving 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of AZA per day were significantly more likely to maintain remission than those treated with lower doses (estimated odds ratio versus placebo of 4.13 for a dose of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> versus 1.20 for a dose of 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids were more likely to be reduced and discontinued in patients receiving AZA as compared with placebo (87 versus 53 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention of recurrence following surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgical resection, AZA or 6-MP may be effective for maintaining remission in the involved areas of bowel that were not resected.
