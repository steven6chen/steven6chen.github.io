Before labor, 15 to 20 percent of term fetuses in cephalic presentation are OP, but only 5 percent are OP at vaginal delivery because most OP fetuses spontaneously rotate to an anterior position during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. In some cases, the OP position at delivery results from malrotation from an occiput anterior (OA) or occiput transverse (OT) position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, this is unlikely once the second stage has begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported risk factors for OP position at delivery include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nulliparity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal age greater than 35 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African-American race</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous OP delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small pelvic outlet (particularly narrow subpubic arch)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age &ge;41 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birthweight &ge;4000 grams</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior placenta</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidural anesthesia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether epidural anesthesia is a risk factor for OP position at delivery is controversial. Most studies, but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], have observed that epidural anesthesia is more likely to be in place when the fetal position at birth is OP than when it is OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/6-9,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,12,15</a>]. The following lines of evidence suggest that relaxation of the pelvic musculature from epidural anesthesia may inhibit rotation from OP to OA, resulting in persistent OP position. These data also dispute the hypothesis that women with OP fetuses request epidurals more often than those with OA fetuses because OP position causes more painful labor, thus accounting for the association.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study performed serial ultrasound examinations of fetal position at study enrollment, at epidural administration or at four hours after the initial sonogram if no epidural was administered, and after 8 cm dilation; position at delivery was also assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The study group included over 1500 nulliparous women in labor with term singleton cephalic presentations; 92 percent of the women received a labor epidural. Major findings were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who requested epidurals and those who did not receive labor epidurals had a similar proportion of fetuses in OP position in early active labor; however, at delivery the epidural group had a statistically higher proportion of OP fetuses (all deliveries: 12.9 versus 3.3 percent; all vaginal births: 10.2 versus 1.9 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The OP position did not appear to cause more painful labors or &quot;back labor.&quot; At the time of the request, women who requested epidurals were no more likely to have a fetus in the OP position than women who did not request epidurals: The proportion of fetuses in the OP position was the same at the time of epidural placement and four hours after study enrollment if an epidural was not placed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2011 meta-analysis of four randomized trials of epidural versus non-epidural or no analgesia in labor, the frequency of malposition at delivery was higher among women who were randomly assigned to epidural analgesia compared with those assigned to other methods or no analgesia during labor (relative risk 1.40, 95% CI 0.98-1.99), although the possibility of no effect could not be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287092670\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential maternal and neonatal consequences of OP position are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114592\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114592 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>OP position may result in protraction of the first or second stage of labor, as well as arrest of the second stage. In one study, the second stage was about 45 minutes longer in OP than OA position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because the OP position can prolong labor, women with an OP fetus are more likely to undergo interventions to hasten labor progress, such as artificial rupture of membranes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation, and operative delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/7,8,11,12,15,18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11,12,15,18-23</a>]. Compared with the OA position, OP position was associated with an almost twofold increase in the rate of operative vaginal delivery (44 versus 24 percent) and a threefold increase in the rate of cesarean delivery (42 versus 14 percent) in a series of over 16,000 nulliparas with singleton cephalic presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other delivery-related consequences of OP include increased risks of anal sphincter injuries, failed forceps or vacuum delivery, and inadvertent extension of the hysterotomy at cesarean.</p><p>Neonatal outcomes associated with delivery in the OP position include a higher risk of five-minute Apgar score less than 7 (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.17-1.91), umbilical artery acidemia (OR 2.92, OR 1.84-4.62), meconium-stained amniotic fluid (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17-1.42), birth trauma (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.22-2.57), and neonatal intensive care admission (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.28-1.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, these risks were attenuated or disappeared when adjusted for confounders. Vaginal delivery of the OP fetus is associated with a lower rate of shoulder dystocia than other cephalic positions, although there is a higher rate of brachial plexus injury in the neonate in the event of a shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of OP position is generally made by digital vaginal examination in the second stage of labor that identifies the fetal frontal (metopic) and coronal sutures and anterior fontanel anteriorly in the maternal pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73262 \">figure 1</a>). If there is uncertainty, ultrasound examination can accurately identify fetal head position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Some clinicians perform ultrasound examination to confirm head position in all cases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2015725039\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transducer is held in the transverse position just above the symphysis pubis and OP position is diagnosed when the fetal orbits face towards the transducer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114593\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114593 \">image 1</a>). Flexion is inferred if the chin is resting on chest on a profile view. If an external fetal heart rate monitor is being used, it should be removed or turned off temporarily as it can interfere with the clarity of the diagnostic images.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following approach to management of OP position is largely based on the authors&rsquo; experience, expert opinion, and observational data. Potential interventions have not been evaluated by large randomized trials, with the exception of maternal positioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547916668\"><span class=\"h2\">Antepartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OP position antepartum is not predictive of fetal position at delivery or adverse outcome. Pregnant women are sometimes advised to perform exercises to facilitate anterior rotation of the fetus, but there is no convincing evidence that these maneuvers are effective or any intervention is warranted to reduce the rate of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The lack of benefit was best illustrated by a large, multicenter, randomized trial that assigned 2547 women at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation to one of two exercise programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Group 1 was told to take a daily walk and Group 2 was asked to assume a hands-and-knees position with slow pelvic rocking for 10 minutes twice a day until labor began. The incidence of OP position at birth or before instrumental rotation was similar (8 percent) for both groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547916728\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrapartum</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14991006\"><span class=\"h3\">First stage of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OP position diagnosed in early active labor is managed expectantly when the fetal heart rate pattern is reassuring and labor is progressing. Intervention is unnecessary because OP position at this stage is a poor predictor of the eventual need for cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and no intervention has been proven beneficial. In randomized trials, maternal repositioning during labor did not significantly increase rotation to occiput anterior or decrease operative delivery rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Manual rotation in the first stage has no demonstrable benefits and may lead to prolapse of the umbilical cord or small parts if the head is disengaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In addition, it is less successful than rotation in the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>If fetal heart rate or labor abnormalities occur, they are managed according to usual clinical standards. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14991018\"><span class=\"h3\">Second stage of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expectant management is also appropriate for OP position early in the second stage as long as the fetal heart rate pattern is reassuring and labor is progressing. Although OP position at this stage increases the chances of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>], 50 to 80 percent of OP fetuses at the beginning of the second stage will rotate spontaneously to OA, justifying an expectant approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Head engagement does not preclude the possibility of spontaneous rotation. </p><p>Fetuses in persistent OP position with a normal fetal heart rate tracing may continue to descend at a reasonable rate and deliver spontaneously from the OP position or descent may become protracted or arrested despite adequate uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts. The optimal management of second stage protraction or arrest is unclear. No randomized trials have been conducted comparing the various approaches (rotation manually or with forceps, operative delivery from OP position, cesarean). </p><p>For women with a prolonged second stage and clinically adequate pelvis for rotation, we attempt manual rotation to the OA position, which has a high success rate (90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]), increases the likelihood of vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], and has low risk of maternal and fetal complications (eg, cervical laceration, fetal distress necessitating expeditious delivery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. We perform rotation during the second stage as soon as descent slows as manual rotation before an arrest is more likely to be successful than after an arrest has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and spontaneous rotation is less likely in this setting. The benefits of early manual rotation were illustrated in a prospective study that compared outcomes of manual rotation versus expectant management of OP position in which manual rotation was performed one hour into the second stage in nulliparas and 30 minutes into the second stage in multiparas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this observational series, manual rotation was associated with OA position at delivery in 28 of 31 fetuses compared with 4 of 30 fetuses managed expectantly (93 versus 15 percent).&nbsp;No cesarean deliveries were performed in 31 pregnancies that underwent an attempt at rotation; in contrast, cesarean delivery was performed in 7 of 30 pregnancies managed expectantly (0 versus 23 percent). Rates of vacuum extraction in the rotation and expectantly managed groups were 23 and 50 percent, respectively.</p><p>If the rotation is successful, the woman continues to push and is managed according to usual clinical standards. If the rotation is unsuccessful, the woman continues to push and subsequent intervention depends on labor progress and fetal status. If arrest of descent occurs (no descent after one hour of adequate pushing) or concern about the fetal heart rate tracing warrants delivery, we attempt operative vaginal delivery from the OP position (ie, without rotation to OA) if the leading point of the fetal skull is &ge;2 cm beyond the ischial spines, estimated fetal weight is &lt;4000 grams, and there is ample room between the fetal occiput and maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">sacrum/coccyx</span>. In assessing station, it is important to determine whether the biparietal diameter has passed through the pelvic inlet (no more than one-fifth of the fetal head should be palpable abdominally if the vertex is engaged) as extreme molding can falsely suggest engagement. If the prerequisites for a safe operative vaginal delivery are not met, then cesarean delivery is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Prerequisites'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14991286\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Manual rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal bladder is emptied prior to the procedure. The operator&rsquo;s hand is inserted into the vagina with the palm upward. Digital rotation is performed by placing the tips of the index and middle fingers in the anterior segment of the lambdoid suture near the posterior fontanelle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79764\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79764 \">figure 2</a>). The fingers are used to flex and slightly dislodge the vertex, rotating the fetal head to the OA position via rotation of the operator's hand and forearm. The thumb may also be used with gentle downward pressure more anteriorly on the parietal bone to aid in rotation. We generally begin the rotational process in between contractions, and the fetal head may need to be held in place for a few contractions to prevent rotation back toward the posterior position. The majority of our patients elect to have epidural anesthesia for labor. If the patient does not have adequate anesthesia and is not able to tolerate manual rotation, a pudendal block or intravenous opioids may provide adequate analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p>Manual rotation can also be performed by placing the operator's four fingers behind the posterior parietal bone with the palm up and the thumb over the anterior parietal bone. The right hand is used for left OP position and the left hand is used for right OP position. The head is grasped with the tips of the fingers and thumb. During a contraction, the patient is encouraged to push and the operator attempts to flex and rotate the fetal head anteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61902 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/35,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42</a>]. Occasional, mild upward pressure may help to slightly displace the head and facilitate rotation. </p><p>Multiple attempts at rotation may be required. Manual rotation performed prior to an operative vaginal birth has little or no increase in risk to the pregnant woman or to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1328401500\"><span class=\"h4\">Prerotation ultrasound assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prerotation ultrasound assessment of the fetal position may improve success rates for manual rotation. In a randomized trial of ultrasound examination of 58 nulliparous women in second-stage arrest with the fetus in OP position, operators who were informed of the fetal spine position had more successful manual rotations than those who did not have this information (83 versus 41 percent), and their patients had a higher percentage of spontaneous deliveries (69 versus 28 percent) and better maternal outcome (eg, intact perineum, less blood loss) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Neonatal outcomes were similar for both groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14993339\"><span class=\"h3\">Operative vaginal delivery from the OP position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual criteria for performance of an operative vaginal delivery apply to the OP position. Although often successful, OP position is associated with a significantly higher rate of failed operative vaginal delivery than OA position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We make our choice of instrument (forceps versus vacuum) based on individual patient factors, weighing the relative risks for success and rectal sphincter injury. As an example, for a tired nulliparous woman with an edematous perineum and fetus at or near the outlet, we prefer a vacuum delivery since it is likely to be successful and minimizes maternal trauma. For a multiparous patient at +2 station with fetal bradycardia, we would perform a forceps delivery rather than vacuum because we have better success with forceps in this setting. This approach is supported by data from a retrospective study on OP operative deliveries that reported the success rates for vacuum versus forceps were outlet: 100 percent for both instruments; low-station: 69 versus 88 percent, and mid-station: 29 versus 83 percent; whereas risk of rectal sphincter injury with vacuum and forceps was 33 and 72 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. All of these differences were statistically significant.</p><p>If forceps are used, we prefer Simpson forceps because these fetuses often have significant molding. Downward traction should be exerted until the brow clears the symphysis pubis and then the head should be flexed to reduce the risk of an anal sphincter tear during extraction. Our decision to attempt forceps delivery from OP position versus manual rotation to OA and extraction is based on our clinical assessment of the mother and fetus. Forceps delivery from the OP position is preferred in women with room posteriorly in the pelvis and a narrow anterior segment. Woman with ample room anteriorly and a fetus in persistent OP position may benefit from manual rotation to OA followed by extraction from the OA position.</p><p>Although anal sphincter injuries occur more commonly with OP deliveries and operative vaginal deliveries, we do not perform episiotomy routinely as it is not clear that episiotomy results in better overall outcome than not performing episiotomy. If an episiotomy is clinically indicated, a mediolateral episiotomy results in fewer fourth degree lacerations than a midline episiotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-episiotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to episiotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If vacuum is used, certain adjustments must be made because the flexion point on OP presentations is positioned more posterior and higher in the vagina than with OA presentations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedure for vacuum-assisted operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Occiput posterior position'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87313442\"><span class=\"h3\">Forceps rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instrument rotation (eg, Kielland forceps rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], Thierry&rsquo;s spatulas rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]) for the persistent OP position should only be performed by clinicians with skill and experience in the performance of these procedures due to the high risk of potential complications. Direct delivery from OP rather than rotation is preferable in women who on clinical examination have ample room between the fetal occiput and maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">sacrum/coccyx</span> and when the pelvis is too narrow to permit anterior rotation (women with an anthropoid pelvis with a narrow transverse diameter and women with an android pelvis with a narrow arch).</p><p>Ultrasound can be helpful to confirm the position of the fetal head and spine before placing forceps. If classic forceps, such as Tucker-McLane or Elliot forceps, are used in the Scanzoni maneuver, the forceps are applied as though the head is OA and then the head is flexed and rotated to the OA position. It can be helpful to dislodge the head to a higher station before rotation to facilitate the procedure. After the rotation a slight pull on the forceps helps to fix the head in the anterior position. The forceps, which are upside down after the rotation, are removed and reapplied one at a time so one forcep splints the head and prevents spontaneous reversion to OP. Forceps-assisted delivery of the head can then be achieved from the anterior position. A more detailed description of these procedures is beyond the scope of this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14993458\"><span class=\"h3\">Cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cesarean delivery is performed using standard techniques.

(See <a href=\"#H547916668\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14991006\" class=\"local\">'First stage of labor'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14991018\" class=\"local\">'Second stage of labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal exercises and repositioning do not increase the rate of spontaneous rotation. (See <a href=\"#H547916668\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14991006\" class=\"local\">'First stage of labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual rotation in the early second stage may lead to prolapse of the umbilical cord or small parts if the head is disengaged, without clear benefits. Head engagement does not preclude the possibility of spontaneous rotation. (See <a href=\"#H14991018\" class=\"local\">'Second stage of labor'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the second stage progresses, fetuses that remain in the OP position may continue to descend at a reasonable rate and deliver spontaneously from the OP position or descent may become protracted or arrested despite adequate uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts. (See <a href=\"#H14991018\" class=\"local\">'Second stage of labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a prolonged second stage and clinically adequate pelvis for rotation, we suggest manual rotation to the OA position rather than expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Manual rotation at this time has a high success rate, increases the likelihood of vaginal birth, and has low risk of maternal and fetal complications. We perform rotation as soon as descent slows as manual rotation before an arrest is more likely to be successful than after an arrest has occurred and spontaneous rotation is less likely in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H14991018\" class=\"local\">'Second stage of labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If rotation is unsuccessful, the woman continues to push and subsequent intervention depends on labor progress and fetal status. If arrest of descent occurs or concern about the fetal heart rate warrants delivery, we attempt operative vaginal delivery from the OP position if the leading point of the fetal skull is &ge;2 cm beyond the ischial spines, estimated fetal weight is &lt;4000 grams, and there is ample room between the fetal occiput and maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">sacrum/coccyx</span>. If the prerequisites for a safe operative vaginal delivery are not met, then cesarean delivery is performed. (See <a href=\"#H14991018\" class=\"local\">'Second stage of labor'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-posterior-position/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gardberg M, Laakkonen E, S&auml;levaara M.
