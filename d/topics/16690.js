In 2012 and 2013, CVD was estimated to result in 17.3 million deaths worldwide on an annual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Many patients who die from CVD experience unexpected sudden cardiac death (SCD), with more than 50 percent of SCD episodes occurring as a first event in persons thought to be at low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Along with ventricular fibrillation, SMVT is responsible for nearly all of the arrhythmic SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SMVT may be idiopathic but occurs most frequently in patients with underlying heart disease of various types including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD), especially with prior myocardial infarction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrative cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chagas heart disease </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex congenital heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac sarcoidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular noncompaction</p><p/><p>CHD is responsible for the majority of cases of SMVT. Approximately 70 percent of the cases of SCD in the United States are due to CHD, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. However, SCD can result from VT that occurs in the absence of known heart disease. Monomorphic VT occurring in the absence of apparent structural heart disease is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3367231099\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND ECG FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history, physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during SMVT and in sinus rhythm can all provide information helping to confirm the diagnosis of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT). Because time may not allow for extensive questioning or examination, identifying a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other structural heart disease is the most important piece of historical information, along with obtaining an accurate list of medications and potential intoxicants (eg, cocaine) to identify any potential triggers for SMVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1768191054\"><span class=\"h2\">History and associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of SMVT can be highly variable, ranging from sudden cardiac arrest to mild symptoms. Although most patients with SMVT experience symptoms, the occasional patient may notice only minimal symptoms. Most patients with SMVT will have a history of underlying structural heart disease (eg, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, etc), although SMVT can also be seen in patients without known structural heart disease. Although SMVT is most commonly related to the development of reentrant circuits that follow healing of a prior myocardial infarction (MI), patients with prior MI may also develop SMVT due to non-reentrant mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the most severe instances, when SMVT significantly impairs cardiac output and results in immediate hemodynamic collapse, patients may briefly experience the onset of symptoms prior to the abrupt loss of consciousness and sudden cardiac arrest. Patients with faster ventricular rates, underlying heart disease, and decompensated heart failure with reduced left ventricular systolic function are more likely to develop hemodynamic instability. In such cases, prompt defibrillation and resuscitation to restore a perfusing heart rhythm is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis#H7842526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Unstable patients'</a>.)</p><p>For patients without immediate sudden cardiac arrest, the type and intensity of symptoms will vary depending upon the rate and duration of SMVT along with the presence or absence of significant comorbid conditions. Patients with SMVT typically present with one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of <span class=\"nowrap\">breath/dyspnea</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General malaise</p><p/><p>Most commonly, symptomatic patients will report palpitations that may or may not be associated with chest pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortness of breath. If the associated rate of SMVT is rapid enough to result in hemodynamic compromise, patients may experience presyncope or even syncope and further deterioration into cardiac arrest. The patient's medication list should be reviewed carefully, with special attention for rate controlling drugs and antiarrhythmic drugs, to assess potential proarrhythmic effects and to guide therapy. QT prolonging drugs, however, typically cause torsades de pointes (ie, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Torsades de pointes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2569063492\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few physical examination findings in patients with SMVT are unique and specific. By definition, patients will have a pulse exceeding 100 beats per minute during the episode. In addition, if the physical examination is performed while SMVT persists, this can reveal evidence of atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, although it is not always easy to detect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. During AV dissociation, the normal coordination of atrial and ventricular contraction is lost, which may produce characteristic physical examination findings including (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'AV dissociation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked fluctuations in the blood pressure because of the variability in the degree of left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, stroke volume, and cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variability in the occurrence and intensity of heart sounds, especially S1 (&quot;cacophony of heart sounds&quot;), which is heard more frequently when the rate of the tachycardia is slower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannon &quot;A&quot; waves &ndash; Cannon A waves are intermittent and irregular jugular venous pulsations of greater amplitude than normal waves. They reflect simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation, resulting in contraction of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve. Prominent A waves can also be seen during some SVTs. Such prominent waves result from simultaneous atrial and ventricular contraction occurring with every beat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with sudden cardiac arrest or hemodynamically unstable SMVT, often the only electrocardiogram (ECG) available is a single-lead assessment from the telemetry monitor or defibrillator showing a wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT); in such instances, a full 12-lead ECG is not typically obtained until the patient has been stabilized. However, for patients with suspected SMVT who are hemodynamically stable, a 12-lead ECG should be performed as this provides the maximal electrocardiographic information for making an accurate diagnosis and determining a possible etiology and may help to direct future therapy. If available, a previous ECG when the patient was in normal sinus rhythm is very helpful for comparison.</p><p>SMVT typically generates a WCT, usually with a QRS width &gt;0.12 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69201\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69201 \">waveform 1</a>). WCT occurring in patients with ischemic heart disease is almost always SMVT. In rare instances, SMVT may present as a relatively narrow complex tachycardia. Such an arrhythmia may be incorrectly diagnosed and treated as a supraventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although uncommon, a QRS complex that is narrower during tachycardia than during sinus rhythm (usually in patients with chronic bundle branch block or intraventricular conduction delay during sinus rhythm) is diagnostic of SMVT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p>A detailed discussion of the ECG characteristics of SMVT is found elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a>). Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ECG hallmark for the diagnosis of SMVT is a wide complex tachycardia with the obvious presence of AV dissociation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52123\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52123 \">waveform 2</a>). If not obvious, AV dissociation is suggested by the presence of fusion complexes (which reflect a supraventricular impulse coming from above the atrioventricular node fusing with an impulse generated in the ventricle) or captured complexes, which reflect an impulse coming from above the atrioventricular node that depolarizes the ventricles when they are no longer refractory but before the next ventricle-generated complex). The occurrence of persistent or intermittent retrograde block is virtually diagnostic of SMVT. However, up to 40 percent of patients have intact ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction during SMVT, and AV dissociation is not seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111254\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef111254 \">waveform 3</a>). VA conduction may occur in a 1:1 pattern, or with second-degree VA block (eg, 2:1 or 3:1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variability in the ST and T waves may be present, reflecting superimposed P waves as well as changes in ventricular repolarization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tachycardia rate is usually constant but may warm up at start and may exhibit some subtle variability. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While concordance, or the presence of monophasic QRS complexes with the same polarity in leads V1 through V6, has been reported to have a specificity of greater than 90 percent for VT, positive concordance can also be present in preexcited tachyarrhythmias, specifically antidromic reciprocating tachycardia, which occur less frequently than VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Negative concordance is rarely seen but is consistent with VT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific QRS morphology, particularly when a shift in QRS axis occurs during WCT, may be helpful.</p><p/><p>Given the number of exceptions and the need to establish the correct diagnosis, electrocardiographic criteria may only be suggestive of SMVT. Confirmation sometimes requires other means, such as intracardiac electrocardiograms from the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or electrophysiologic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3870856345\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SMVT should be suspected in a patient who presents with either sudden cardiac arrest, syncope, or sustained palpitations, particularly in a patient with a known history of structural heart disease. </p><p>The diagnosis of SMVT is typically confirmed following review of an ECG, acquired during the arrhythmia, showing a wide QRS complex tachycardia with the presence of AV dissociation (manifest as an atrial rate slower than the ventricular rate). Frequently, however, it is not possible to identify P waves and the atrial rate amongst the wide QRS complexes, so other evidence of AV dissociation (ie, fusion and capture beats) is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of VT. Additional ECG features (eg, QRS axis, concordance, QRS morphology, etc) can provide additional supportive evidence for a diagnosis of VT versus supraventricular tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111307 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3329769114\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for a wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT) includes SMVT, supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction (either preexistent or rate-related), supraventricular tachycardia with preexcitation, and tachycardia with ventricular pacing. Differentiating SMVT from other causes of WCT may be difficult, particularly if a high-quality 12-lead ECG is not available during the time of the arrhythmia. The presence of a WCT in a patient with coronary heart disease (CHD) or structural heart disease probably represents SMVT. In contrast, a WCT in a patient without CHD or structural heart disease more likely represents supraventricular tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234888001\"><span class=\"h2\">Supraventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with an underlying bundle branch block, or someone that is dependent on a ventricular pacemaker, who then develops tachycardia will, by definition, have a wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT). Review of a baseline ECG showing bundle branch block or ventricular paced rhythm with a similar QRS morphology to that seen during WCT suggests a higher likelihood of supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, but does not exclude ventricular tachycardia.</p><p>In patients who present with symptomatic WCT, where time may be limited, a history of CHD or structural heart disease (or absence thereof) is the most important piece of historical information helping the clinician to distinguish supraventricular tachycardia from SMVT. While the absence of CHD or other structural heart disease does not exclude SMVT, supraventricular tachycardia is much more likely in patients without CHD or structural heart disease.

These include electrolyte imbalances, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, adverse drug effects, anemia, hypotension, and heart failure, which may trigger SMVT or contribute to its persistence but are rarely the primary cause for the arrhythmia. Thereafter, a thorough diagnostic evaluation to exclude associated structural heart disease is warranted. Even young, otherwise healthy patients need a thorough evaluation to exclude entities such as undiagnosed cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of a coronary artery, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and pediatric coronary artery abnormalities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Anatomy, histology, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation to establish the presence and type of heart disease generally includes various invasive and noninvasive techniques, depending in part upon the clinical history and presentation. Cardiac imaging (with echocardiography and preferably cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging) and continuous ECG monitoring (for 24 hours or longer while hospitalized) should be performed in all patients. Invasive electrophysiology studies (EPS) can frequently be helpful but are not routinely performed in most patients, unless catheter ablation is being considered or there is persistent diagnostic uncertainty. </p><p>Signal-averaged ECG (SAECG) is rarely helpful in evaluating patients with SMVT. In patients presenting with SMVT without known structural heart disease, stress testing can be helpful as a screen for coronary heart disease, and may help elicit VT in patients with idiopathic VT, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or other unusual structural abnormalities. In patients with SMVT and history of prior myocardial infarction [MI], revascularization is rarely adequate as monotherapy to prevent recurrent VT, as SMVT is usually due to a reentrant circuit emanating from a prior infarct scar. CPVT is classically triggered by exertion, but condition is usually associated with frequent PVCs and PMVT on stress testing, not SMVT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38095671\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with SMVT should undergo cardiac imaging to evaluation for structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Echocardiography has long been the preferred method for evaluation of structural heart disease because of its widespread availability, accuracy in diagnosing a variety of structural cardiac defects (myocardial, valvular, congenital), safety to the patients, and relatively low expense. However, CMR imaging generally provides superior image quality and also allows for tissue characterization, making it an important imaging option for certain diagnoses (eg, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, cardiac sarcoidosis, other infiltrative cardiomyopathies, etc) and for patients with poor quality or non-diagnostic echocardiographic images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].
