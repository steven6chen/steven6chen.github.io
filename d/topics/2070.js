Of slightly more than 61,000 OOH births that year, 63.1 percent were home births and 30.9 percent took place in free-standing birth centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For women thought to be at low risk for obstetric complications when they go into labor, entering labor care at a birth center can result in greater satisfaction, cost savings, and the same or better outcomes than in-hospital births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide a brief history of the development of birth centers in the United States and the evidence regarding the birth center model of care. Home birth is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=planned-home-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Planned home birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY OF OUT-OF-HOSPITAL BIRTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, out-of-hospital births took place in the mother's home, maternity homes, clinics, or a birth room in a doctor's office. During the first half of that century, those sites served women who did not have access to, could not afford, or did not want the services of physicians and acute care hospitals. During this era, the first American nurse-midwifery services were established to provide care for the poor, eg, the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky, the Maternity Center Association in New York City, and La Casita, operated by the Medical Mission Sisters in Santa Fe. </p><p>The proportion of births in hospitals rose from 37 percent in 1935 to 97 percent in 1960, and reached 99 percent by the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Several developments after World War II led to this change: (1) The GI Bill broadened opportunities for medical education, which resulted in doubling of the number of medical schools and new physicians; (2) the Hill Burton Act promoted the construction of community hospitals, which improved access to hospital care; (3) hospitals offered methods of pain relief in labor that were unavailable in the home; and (4) the expansion of employer-based health insurance and the beginning of Medicaid paid for care for pregnant women but only for maternity services provided by physicians and hospitals, not for out-of-hospital births.</p><p>As a result, birth moved from mostly in homes to mostly in hospitals and from care provided mostly by traditional midwives to care provided by physicians. Since births in American hospitals were attended exclusively by clinicians assisted by nurses, nurse-midwifery did not develop in the United States as it had in other similarly developed countries. In contrast, midwifery had been well-established in Europe since the 1700s, and the movement of births from homes to hospitals was accompanied by the movement of midwives into hospitals.</p><p>As childbirth moved into hospitals, the needs of healthy mothers with low-risk pregnancies were not considered separately from those of mothers with medical or obstetric problems, and there was little evaluation of the impact of hospitalization on mothers, babies, families, or society as a whole. The observation that the health of sick mothers and babies was improved by specialist care in acute-care hospitals led to the establishment of the medical model of obstetric care for all pregnant women. Scant attention was paid to the often quite different needs of the majority of women who were healthy and anticipated an uncomplicated childbirth.</p><p>Reactions to increasing technological intervention in acute care hospitals began as early as the 1940s, when Grantly Dick Read, a British obstetrician considered to be the father of natural childbirth, published &quot;Childbirth Without Fear,&quot; in which he promoted his hypothesis that most of the pain in childbirth was caused by fear. Based in part on this work, a consumer-driven natural childbirth education movement developed and asked for maternity care with less medical intervention and more focus on the family. Hospitals tried to respond to this consumer demand by relaxing restrictions on family participation, but these changes were difficult to implement in the acute care setting. In the late 1960s, some upper middle-class women began opting for home births in an effort to reclaim control of the natural physiological process of birth. Home births were unattended or attended by a new kind of lay-midwife, most of whom had little or no formal training in midwifery. Many had been childbirth educators, Le Leche League leaders, nurses, or mothers who had been &quot;radicalized&quot; by their own bad hospital or good home birth experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>During the 1970s, concern about the safety of unattended and lay-midwife-attended home births prompted the Maternity Center Association, a voluntary health agency in New York City, to establish a demonstration birth center in an affluent urban setting. It was designed and operated to provide professional nurse-midwifery care in collaboration with obstetrical specialists for women anticipating a normal pregnancy and birth. If that expectation changed, birth-center professionals referred or transferred the woman to the collaborating obstetrical specialist and hospital for further evaluation and appropriate care. The Maternity Center Association has been reorganized as Childbirth Connection, and focuses on informing women about evidence-based maternity care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE BIRTH CENTER MODEL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A birth center was originally defined as any health facility, place or institution that was not a hospital or in a hospital, where births were planned to occur away from the mother's usual residence following a normal uncomplicated low-risk pregnancy. This definition has been modified to include in-hospital birth centers that demonstrate autonomy in operation and separation from the acute-care obstetric unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Philosophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The birth center philosophy maintains that pregnancy and birth are normal physiological, psychosocial, and economic events within a family until proven otherwise. In general, the atmosphere of birth centers is relaxed, there are few routines, and the environment is more like a home than a hospital. Women wear their own clothes; control who will be with them during labor and birth; take showers or baths; and eat, drink and walk or change positions freely. It is rare for the mother and baby to be separated after the birth. The newborn is examined on the mother's bed as an opportunity to explain newborn behavior, enhance family-newborn bonding, and answer questions.</p><p>If complications that require medical or surgical intervention arise, the care of the woman or newborn is transferred to the collaborating clinician, most often an obstetrician (sometimes a family physician) or neonatologist at the collaborating hospital. Some birth center nurse-midwives also practice in the hospital and thus often continue to manage care after transfer. Some birth centers transfer women to care by hospital-based nurse-midwives. Compliance with strict transfer criteria has resulted in good outcomes for these patients, even when intrapartum complications occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth center care providers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Birth centers are typically staffed by midwives. Certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) attended 53.8 percent of births that occurred in birth centers in 2015; other midwives attended 39 percent, and physicians attended 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This was a slight increase by CNMs and a decrease by physicians as compared with 2013. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for eligibility for birth center care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1974, in preparation for its demonstration Childbearing Center, the Maternity Center Association formed a Research Advisory Committee of professionals representing obstetrics, neonatology, nursing, nurse-midwifery, and public health to develop criteria for low risk pregnancy and childbirth based on the best evidence available at that time. Blue <span class=\"nowrap\">Cross/Blue</span> Shield of Greater New York and New York State evaluated the use and outcome of these risk criteria over a 16-month period, and validated their use. Little has changed from the initial criteria defining a low risk pregnancy and birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An evidence-based, rigorous screening process begins when a woman enrolls in a birth center for prenatal care, or sometimes with an initial phone call. Women who are candidates for birth center care should not have medical or obstetric conditions that increase the risk of intrapartum complications. They are generally healthy, not obese, and unlikely to use tobacco or illicit drugs. Women who have had a previous cesarean delivery are at higher risk of serious intrapartum complications and therefore are usually excluded from birth center care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although, this is controversial, and further study of this small subset of women is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Careful screening continues at every prenatal visit using predefined risk criteria that are mutually agreed upon by the birth center care providers and collaborating physicians. Women who experience pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, preterm labor, or significant anemia, are required to give birth in the hospital, where their care is often managed collaboratively by a midwife and obstetrician team.</p><p>Criteria by which a pregnancy is judged to be low risk at the onset of labor include having followed a normal, uncomplicated prenatal course as determined during adequate care and lack of any reason to anticipate a serious complication during labor, as defined by reasonable and generally accepted criteria. There should be only one fetus, no serious obstetrical or medical conditions, no previous cesarean delivery, cephalic presentation and neither pre- nor post-term onset of labor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Scope of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Birth center care encompasses the antepartum, intrapartum, and <span class=\"nowrap\">postpartum/neonatal</span> periods. Since the woman becomes familiar with the birth center and its personnel during her pregnancy, there is no need for a &quot;hospital visit&quot; or a &quot;meet the provider&quot; night to view where the birth will take place and meet the people who might be involved.</p><p>Antepartum care provided at a birth center is more time and education intensive than traditional physician-led pregnancy care. In addition to the usual components of antepartum care, birth center care focuses on building the childbearing couple&rsquo;s confidence in having a normal birth and caring for their newborn. The pregnant woman is a member of her health care team and shared decision-making is a fundamental principle of birth center care. All of the standard prenatal tests are offered to women by their birth center providers, as indicated, with discussion of the risks and benefits of each test.</p><p>Birth center care during labor and birth continues this time-intensive, one-on-one approach. In accordance with a large body of research indicating that intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart rate is appropriate and safe for low-risk women, birth centers use intermittent auscultation rather than continuous electronic fetal monitoring to monitor the status of the fetus during labor. If a condition indicating the need for continuous electronic monitoring occurs, the mother is transferred to a hospital, as she is no longer appropriate for out-of-hospital birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fetal heart rate assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some birth centers offer narcotic analgesics for pain relief during labor, although pharmacologic pain relief is rarely needed and used sparingly only after nonpharmacologic methods have been tried. Many birth centers provide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> for labor analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-approaches-to-management-of-labor-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Epidural analgesia is not offered in birth centers because of the risks involved with its use and the need for additional medical interventions (eg, intravenous infusions, continuous electronic fetal monitoring, frequent blood pressure monitoring, urinary bladder catheterization, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation, and an increased need for operative vaginal deliveries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Operative vaginal deliveries are not performed in birth centers. Need for an epidural or operative vaginal birth indicates the need for transfer to a hospital. Episiotomies are rarely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The midwife or other professional care provider monitors the condition of the mother and baby closely during the immediate postpartum and neonatal periods, while also providing appropriate privacy for families. Follow-up postpartum and newborn care may include telephone calls and other electronic communication, home visits, and breastfeeding support, as well as an office visit within the first two weeks. All women have at least a telephone call and one in-person visit. Women who were transferred to a hospital during labor may be provided routine birth center follow-up, according to their preference.</p><p>In the mid-1980s National Birth Center Study (NBCS, discussed below), virtually all of the women who were not transferred to a hospital during labor or soon after giving birth had one or more home or office visits during the four to six weeks postpartum period. Birth center staff visited 40 percent of the women in their home, including 4 percent who were visited within 24 hours of the birth. Most of the home visits occurred on the second or third postpartum day. Sixty-three percent of the women had at least one home or office visit within the first three postpartum days. Most women who had home visits had only one; 9 percent had two or more. Some birth centers provide primary care to newborns during the neonatal period or the entire first year of life. Birth centers operated by family practice physicians provided care to the infants of two-thirds of their clients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Birth center clinicians provide thorough information with extensive discussion of care choices. Parents are asked to sign a document asserting that they understand the risks and benefits of labor and delivery at a birth center and have chosen to labor and give birth in the birth center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72798%7EOBGYN%2F53826%7EOBGYN%2F65561\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef72798 graphicRef53826 graphicRef65561 \">form 1A-C</a>). This discussion and consent form should review unforeseen events that can occur during any childbirth, and how they might be handled at the birth center as compared to a hospital. The consent process includes discussion of a list of specific complications that would require a prenatal referral to the collaborating physician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfer of the mother or baby to a hospital during labor or after birth. Arrangements for access to a specialist and in-hospital care for mother and newborn, if needed, should be reviewed periodically during antenatal care, and the approximate time it may take to affect a transfer to a hospital in emergent situations should be discussed. Birth centers conduct regular emergency drills, including drills with area emergency teams, and thus can tell families how a necessary emergency transfer would proceed. All birth centers know their average emergency and nonemergency transport times, and how they vary with the time of day, traffic, and <span class=\"nowrap\">weather/road</span> conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Licensing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Public Health Association (APHA) has published official &quot;Guidelines for the Regulation of Birth Centers,&quot; which are used by states to write regulations for licensing birth centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As of 2015, 82 percent of states in the United States licensed birth centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Standards and accreditation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accreditation is a voluntary process that includes self-evaluation of all of the essential elements of the organization and management of birth center quality of care. It is designed as an educational process and is similar to that used to accredit hospitals and other health care facilities. The Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers (CABC) accreditation process provides birth centers with a benchmark for comparing their own performance with national standards and with other birth centers. Accredited birth centers are expected to comply with national standards and are held accountable for their care and outcomes by their peers. As of 2015, 90 birth centers were accredited by the CABC, and 7 other birth centers were in the accreditation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Four states either require CABC accreditation for licensure or waive site visits by the regulatory agency when CABC site visits are conducted. One state without birth center licensure requires CABC accreditation for Medicaid reimbursement. Thirty-three percent of all birth centers known to the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC) and 71 percent of AABC-member birth centers are CABC-accredited, an increase of 52 percent in the past three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This increase was driven by a growing recognition of the value of accreditation among birth center providers and increased payer mandates that birth centers maintain CABC-accreditation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicolegal liability</span></p><p>Birth centers are subject to the same volatility in the liability insurance market that has affected other facilities that provide care during birth. In 1985, the liability insurance carrier for birth centers and nurse-midwives withdrew from the obstetrical insurance market, forcing one-fourth of all birth centers operating at that time to close. In 2015, three national carriers and several regional carriers offered medical liability insurance for birth centers; birth center members of AABC reported that the increase in premiums had stabilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The AABC periodically surveys its members for information on claims ever filed and outcomes of those claims. Thirty-five centers in 13 states reported liability data in 2010. Ten reported no claims against the center for at least the previous 20 years. Information was provided about 14 claims against birth centers; 1 was dismissed, 2 were dropped, 10 were settled out of court, and a jury decided in favor of the birth center in one case. Two birth centers that reported claims did not provide other information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In addition to providing its member birth centers a comprehensive Quality Improvement Program, AABC works with liability insurance carriers that insure midwives and birth centers to reduce liability risks by reviewing claims that have been filed and offers risk reduction education based on what is learned by those reviews. One goal is to facilitate and ensure complete documentation of the care provided, the plan for management of care, formal and informal consultations, referrals, and transfers. Frequent and regular emergency simulation drills at least quarterly, ideally with local Emergency Medical Service personnel, to document evaluation of their performance, and follow up any identified deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE BIRTH CENTER MODEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of out-of-hospital birth has always been paramount to those who support or oppose it. In 1982, The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published the work of a committee of experts, &quot;Research Issues in the Assessment of Birth Settings,&quot; which concluded that &quot;reliable information about the safety and efficacy of different birth settings, the psychological benefits of different practices, and the difference in economic costs of the alternatives is lacking.&quot; This statement provided the impetus for the first National Birth Center Study (NBCS I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/7,17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,25,26</a>]. In May 2007, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledged the safety of births in freestanding birth centers that meet the standards of relevant accrediting organizations, eg, the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers (CABC) and the Joint Commission.</p><p>No large randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been conducted to compare birth center outcomes to outcomes of care in hospitals. Most women are adamant about their preference for a hospital or out-of-hospital birth, making RCTs to compare the safety of various birth settings not feasible. Other research designs have been used to provide evidence on the safety of various birth settings. The best available data on birth centers are from the NBCS I (1985 to 1987) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/7,17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,25,26</a>] and the NBCS II (2007 to 2010) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Major findings and conclusions of both studies are summarized below. No study has ever reported poorer outcomes among women cared for in United States birth centers as compared with United States hospitals.</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized trials and other controlled studies have been used to evaluate many elements of childbirth care. Many interventions used almost routinely in labor and birth in some United States hospitals are overused, and overuse has been associated with complications and poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Many women choose to give birth in birth centers to avoid unnecessary use of those procedures and routines. At the same time, research has supported the value of maternity care elements that are hallmarks of birth center care, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antepartum pregnancy and childbirth education (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for labor and childbirth&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregiver support during labor and birth (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous labor support by a doula&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic management of labor pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-approaches-to-management-of-labor-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education and support for initiation and continuation of breastfeeding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137349612\"><span class=\"h2\">The National Birth Center Study</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">The National Birth Center Study, 1985 to 1987</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Association of Childbearing Centers (now the American Association of Birth Centers [AABC]) conducted a large prospective study of birth center care in the United States during the mid-1980s: the NBCS I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/7,17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,25,26</a>].

Participants received care in 79 midwifery-led birth centers in 33 states. The major findings are strikingly similar to the results found in NBCS I, which was conducted 22 years earlier. Clinical outcomes and intrapartum transfer rates were nearly the same during the two study periods. This consistency in key outcomes speaks to the durability of the birth center model of care over time despite consistent increases in rates of cesarean births and other obstetric interventions nationwide between the two time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfers out of birth center care during pregnancy, before and during labor or soon after birth:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A medical or obstetrical problem developed in 14 percent of women who entered prenatal care planning a birth center birth and made them ineligible for out-of-hospital birth.

In addition, 2.6 percent of newborns were transferred to hospitals after being born in the birth center; most of these transfers were for respiratory problems.

This review supports data previously published on birth center outcomes from the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/38,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40,41</a>], Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>], and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. These studies have generally demonstrated that for low-risk women, birth centers are associated with perinatal outcomes comparable with, or better than, those for in-hospital care, with high rates of patient satisfaction and lower rates of medical and operative intrapartum intervention. However, in one United States study that analyzed birth outcomes by location of planned birth rather than actual delivery site, the approximately 16 percent of infants of planned out-of-hospital births (including freestanding birth centers and home births) who were transferred for in-hospital delivery had higher rates of perinatal death, neonatal seizures, and neonatal ventilator support compared with infants of planned in-hospital births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Mothers who planned out-of-hospital births had fewer obstetric interventions (eg, induction, augmentation, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery) and a higher rate of blood transfusion. Disaggregation by planned birth site corrected misclassifications that occurred in some prior studies when a woman who planned an out-of-hospital birth was transferred to a hospital for delivery and subsequently counted as an in-hospital birth. Such misclassification potentially underestimated risk for out-of-hospital birth and overestimated risk for in-hospital birth. A limitation of this study is that the relative contributions of women planning delivery at a birth center or at home are not known. In addition, few birth centers in the state in which the above study was conducted were accredited by the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers (CABC) during the time period of the study. As accredited birth centers are required to have formal relationships with physicians and hospitals, the inclusion of non-certified centers may have further impacted the results. A growing number of birth centers in the state have now sought and achieved CABC accreditation.</p><p>Birth centers are, in general, more likely to have formal relationships with&nbsp;physicians and hospitals than home birth providers, and such relationships are required by AABC standards and CABC accreditation. This study uses data from a state in which there were few CABC-accredited birth centers and birth centers that actively support AABC standards. This may contribute to the difference between Snowden's findings and those of Rooks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and Stapleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact on birth interventions &ndash; Some studies suggest that the hospital environment rather than the type of provider, is associated with more birth interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. In a study of birth outcomes for 2000 low-risk women, all of whom received midwifery care, the women who labored in hospitals with midwives were less likely to have an intact perineum (23 versus 30 percent) and were more likely to undergo cesarean delivery (9.5 verus 4.4 percent) than the women who labored in birth centers with midwives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Women in hospital settings, regardless of provider type, were also more likely to have obstetric interventions such as continuous electronic fetal monitoring, intravenous hydration, episiotomy, and lithotomy position for birth. The rates of antepartum, intrapartum, and neonatal complications were the same between groups. However, some neonatal complications were more common in the hospital-birth group compared with the birth center group, including fetal distress (6.6 versus 1.8 percent), cord prolapse (0.2 versus 0.03 percent), and difficulty establishing neonatal respirations (1.1 versus 0.4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact on cesarean delivery rate &ndash; A study of AABC registry data compared women in labor admitted to a birth center (n = 8776) or to a hospital (n = 2527) for elective, planned hospital birth and attended by the nurse-midwives from the birth center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Women admitted to labor in birth centers had an approximately 38 percent reduced risk of cesarean birth compared with women who labored in the hospital setting. Of note, the overall cesarean delivery rate was low for both groups at less than 5 percent. Neonatal outcomes were similar between the groups. It is possible that the nurse-midwives transferred some of their birth center model into the hospital when caring for these women and that generalizing the model to wider populations could reduce cesarean rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, a study of over 3000 women receiving care at birth centers participating in the Strong Start project between 2012 and 2014 reported that elective hospital admission in labor was associated with a fourfold greater risk of cesarean birth in a medically low-risk women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This sample included both women who received hospital intrapartum care from birth center midwives and women who had prenatal care in birth centers but intrapartum care in hospitals from other providers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact on national quality benchmarks &ndash; In recognition of birth center outcomes, the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation included birth centers as one model for study in the Strong Start for Mothers and Newborns Initiative from 2012 to 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The goal of the program was to reduce preterm births and improve outcomes for newborns and pregnant women. The AABC identified 48 birth centers from 19 states to participate in the study. AABC enrolled over 8400 women in Strong Start, with over 6200 births. AABC Strong Start enrollees were similar in terms of demographics and psychosocial risk factors to the overall population of childbearing women in the United States. Birth centers met or exceeded national quality benchmarks for elective delivery prior to 39 weeks, incidence of episiotomy; cesarean rate; nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex cesarean rate; and exclusive breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Preterm birth and low birth weight rates were lower than national rates, including those for African American women and those with a history of previous preterm birth, both at higher risk for preterm birth in the current pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14173429\"><span class=\"h2\">Studies comparing the costs of maternity care in birth centers versus hospital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have examined the cost of care provided in birth centers compared with hospitals, including costs associated with transfer for a hospital delivery. These studies have consistently found that birth center care is associated with cost savings of 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/47,48,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,58</a>]. Some of this difference in cost appears to be related to less use of resources and procedures, eg, induction of labor, epidurals, opioid analgesia, continuous electronic fetal monitoring, cesarean sections, length of hospital stays and neonatal intensive care in the birth center collaborative model versus the traditional physician-based model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The AABC estimates that &quot;if even 10 percent (400,000) of the approximately four million women who give birth in the United States each year delivered their babies in birth centers, the savings in facility fee payments alone would be at least $2.6 billion&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This cost savings is particularly significant for Medicaid, which pays for about half of the births in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-centers/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69393192\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Birth center midwives provide care at birth centers in settings that are relaxed, more like a home than a hospital, and minimize routines in favor of individualization. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Philosophy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Birth center care providers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Scope of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women planning to deliver at a birth center should be at low risk of developing maternal or <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> complications. A pregnancy is not considered low risk if the mother has a past history of serious obstetric or medical conditions, the prenatal course deviates from normal, labor occurs preterm or postterm, or the birth is expected to be complicated (eg, malpresentation). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for eligibility for birth center care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth center midwives can identify women who are at low risk for obstetric complications and serve them safely in this non-hospital setting. Birth centers provide care for these women at lower cost than care in hospitals and obtain maternal and neonatal outcomes that are comparable to those for low risk women cared for by physicians or midwives and nurses in hospitals. Birth center care is associated with higher levels of patient satisfaction and lower rates of many interventions, including cesarean deliveries. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Evidence supporting the birth center model'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accreditation is not required to operate in all jurisdictions,&nbsp;but indicates that a birth center has met a high standard of evidence-based and widely recognized benchmarks for maternity care, neonatal care, business operations, and safety.
