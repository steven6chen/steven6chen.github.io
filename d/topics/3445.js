The normal sequence of activation is altered dramatically in patients with bifascicular block, with a resultant characteristic appearance on the ECG that varies depending upon the exact fascicles which are blocked. Interruptions in conduction may result in right bundle branch block (RBBB), left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), or left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), with bifascicular block resulting when two of these three are identified from the ECG.</p><p>A 2009 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACCF/HRS)</span> scientific statement on the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram recommends against using the term bifascicular block (and also trifascicular block) since these patterns do not have unique anatomic and pathologic substrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, these terms are still widely entrenched in clinical practice and scientific literature, meriting their discussion here.</p><p>The anatomy, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, prognostic implications, and treatment of bifascicular block (RBBB with either LAFB or LPFB) will be reviewed here. Though technically a type of bifascicular block, complete LBBB is discussed separately, as are conduction system abnormalities involving only a single fascicle.

Although this definition is used in the 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/HRS)</span> guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], some authors, including those of the guidelines on the management of syncope published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), include left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the definition of bifascicular block since LBBB, as noted, implies block in both fascicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trifascicular block</strong> &ndash; The term trifascicular block is most commonly used to describe bifascicular block associated with prolongation of the PR interval (ie, first degree AV block). However, this description, though commonly used in clinical practice, is <em>inaccurate</em> as the conduction delay resulting in the PR interval prolongation does not usually occur in a fascicle, but in the AV node. True trifascicular block would involve block of the right bundle branch and both fascicles of the left bundle branch; this manifests as third degree (complete) heart block and is referred to as such. Sinus rhythm with alternating <span class=\"nowrap\">left/right</span> bundle branch block or right bundle branch block (RBBB) with alternating fascicular blocks on a beat-to-beat basis is a very rare manifestation of trifascicular block, usually heralding complete AV block.

Additionally, cardiac imaging with echocardiography is indicated, as this presentation could be the initial manifestation of structural heart disease. In our opinion, patients presenting with unexplained syncope and bifascicular block should be evaluated immediately as possible progression to heart block is unknown at initial presentation. In those patients with a structurally normal heart and unexplained syncope, an electrophysiologic study (EPS) could identify occult infranodal conduction disease and prompt permanent pacemaker implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Finally, in those patients with unexplained syncope and no obvious etiology, long-term monitoring with an implantable loop recorder is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited data suggest that tilt table testing is not helpful in patients with bifascicular block with unexplained syncope, and as such we do not recommend tilt table testing in this population. In a study comparing such patients with control subjects with bifascicular block and no syncope, no difference in the incidence of a positive tilt table test (28 versus 32 percent) was observed, suggesting that test specificity in this population is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H678701558\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While bifascicular block has one of two fairly characteristic appearances on electrocardiogram (ECG), there are other conditions in which the ECG may have a similar appearance that need to be excluded prior to confirming the diagnosis of bifascicular block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3138282925\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular tachycardia and accelerated idioventricular rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the dominant ventricular rhythm originates from a pacemaker in the ventricle, the QRS will be widened and can have the appearance of bifascicular block.

In one study of 554 patients with bifascicular or trifascicular block who were followed for an average of 42 months, only 1 percent per year progressed to complete heart block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among patients with syncope or other symptoms at baseline, the likelihood of progression to symptomatic high-grade heart block appears high. In a study of 249 patients with bifascicular block (of which 41 percent were left bundle branch block [LBBB]), 57 patients required a permanent pacemaker for &quot;significant atrioventricular (AV) block&quot; over a median follow-up of 4.5 years (5 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Otherwise unexplained syncope in the presence of bifascicular block is an indication for a permanent pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. However, because unexplained syncope can be due to nonarrhythmic causes, it is possible for those with a pacemaker to continue to experience syncope, and thus an accurate diagnosis is desirable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A randomized trial of empiric pacemaker implantation for patients with bifascicular block and syncope has been completed with results expected in late 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-bifascicular-blocks/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
