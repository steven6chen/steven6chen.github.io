Although the degree of thecal sac compression required for the designation of ESCC has been variably defined, we consider any radiologic evidence of indentation of the thecal sac to be evidence for ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. High-grade ESCC refers to deformation of the spinal cord itself.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of ESCC are discussed here. The clinical features and diagnostic approach to patients with possible ESCC are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment for patients with ESCC include pain control, avoidance of complications, and the preservation or improvement of neurologic function utilizing treatments appropriate to the patient's burden of disease, life expectancy, and values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H679514895\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of treatment delay on posttreatment ambulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single most important prognostic factor for regaining ambulation after treatment of an ESCC is pretreatment neurologic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. In a review of 1392 patients presenting between 1963 and 1982, only 32 percent were ambulatory at the onset of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar results were noted in a study published in 1998 in which only 33 percent of patients were ambulatory and 53 percent catheter-free at the time of therapy, indicating that little improvement had been made in the early detection of ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These patients had back pain for a median of two months before ESCC was diagnosed, and there was a 10-day delay between the onset of neurologic symptoms and the start of therapy. The majority of patients had deterioration of motor or bladder function during the delay. </p><p>Thus, educating cancer patients and their families as well as responsible health care providers about symptoms that warrant immediate evaluation, particularly otherwise unexplained back pain, might improve neurologic outcomes. More recent data suggest that these numbers are improving; in a 2010 study, 62 percent of patients who presented with an ESCC were ambulatory at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of patients with ESCC includes the immediate administration of glucocorticoids in nearly all patients, followed by surgery, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Systemic therapy may be beneficial in patients with chemosensitive tumors.</p><p>Symptomatic treatment of ESCC often begins prior to definitive therapy and consists of the following general principles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain management &ndash; Patients with ESCC are frequently in severe pain, often limiting the ability to perform a thorough neurologic examination. Glucocorticoids usually improve the pain within several hours, but most patients require opiate analgesics to tolerate the physical examination and necessary diagnostic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bedrest &ndash; There is generally no need to confine the patient to bed. Patients are generally quite adept at avoiding maneuvers that trigger their pain and there is no risk that movement will worsen the neurologic status unless the patient has an unstable spine. (See <a href=\"#H679515503\" class=\"local\">'Assessing spinal stability'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation &ndash; Many patients with cancer are in a hypercoagulable state. Although the value of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism has not been studied specifically in patients with ESCC, anticoagulation (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, low molecular weight heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>) should be considered if the patient is immobilized due to the ESCC and there is no active bleeding or other contraindications to the use of anticoagulants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If surgery is planned in the immediate future, anticoagulation should be withheld. If there are contraindications to the use of anticoagulants, such patients should be treated with mechanical prophylaxis, such as pneumatic venous compression devices or graduated compression stockings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with cancer&quot;, section on 'Prevention of VTE in patients with cancer'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of constipation &ndash; Autonomic dysfunction from the spinal lesion, limited mobility, and opiate analgesics all can contribute to the development of constipation, ileus, and occasionally perforation of an abdominal viscus, the symptoms of which may be masked by glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Consequently, an aggressive bowel regimen is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;, section on 'Opioid bowel dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with pain that is refractory to standard management, consideration should be given to kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. (See <a href=\"#H679516192\" class=\"local\">'Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose corticosteroid therapy is generally considered to be part of the standard regimen for ESCC, despite limited documented evidence of benefit and a significant risk of serious side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>]. Several studies have suggested that lower doses can be effective but they have not been assessed in randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The beneficial actions of glucocorticoids in restoring neurologic function in patients with ESCC were first reported in the late 1960s. Animal studies documenting salutary effects in various models of ESCC soon followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Only three clinical trials have addressed the utility and optimal initial dose of glucocorticoids in ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 57 patients with carcinoma (two-thirds with a primary in the breast) and myelographically confirmed ESCC were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (96 mg intravenously followed by 24 mg four times daily for three days and then tapered over 10 days) or no dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Stratification factors included primary tumor type and the extent of neurologic dysfunction; all patients received standardized RT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A significantly higher percentage of patients in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> group remained ambulatory both at the conclusion of therapy (81 versus 63 percent) and at six months (59 versus 33 percent). Significant side effects were seen in three patients (11 percent in the steroid group). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal initial dose of steroids was addressed in a small trial in which 20 patients undergoing RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) were randomly assigned to 96 or 16 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> daily for the first 48 hours, followed by a rapid taper over 15 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The incidence of serious adverse events was five of nine in the high-dose and four of 11 in the low-dose group. There were no advantages for pain control or one month ambulation with high dose steroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial that attempted to identify the optimal corticosteroid dose, 37 patients with ESCC were randomly assigned to an initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> bolus of 10 mg or 100 mg intravenously, both followed by 16 mg daily orally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There were no differences in pain control or neurologic outcome between the two groups.</p><p/><p>A Cochrane meta-analysis of these three studies concluded that the available data provided insufficient evidence as to the role of corticosteroids and the appropriate initial dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When all three trials were considered, higher initial doses were not associated with better outcomes, but they were associated with a higher incidence of serious adverse events (such as perforated gastric ulcer, psychosis, and death from infection).</p><p>The prominence of steroid-induced complications with higher initial doses was underscored in another uncontrolled series of 28 patients undergoing RT, all of whom were initially treated with 96 mg IV, tapering to off within 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Side effects were noted in 28 percent, one-half of which were considered serious or life threatening. As a result, the high-dose regimen was abandoned and the initial dose was lowered to 16 mg daily tapered over two weeks; there were no serious side effects seen in 38 patients, and the ambulatory outcome was similar to that seen with higher dose therapy.</p><p>It is uncertain if patients with less severe disease need steroid therapy. One small phase II trial showed that patients with back pain but no myelopathy and less than 50 percent narrowing of the spinal canal by epidural tumor could successfully undergo RT without receiving glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician has a choice between the &quot;high&quot; dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> with proven efficacy and a relatively high rate of serious side effects and a &quot;low&quot; dose with notably fewer side effects but no randomized controlled data to support its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>We reserve the high-dose regimen for patients with paraparesis or paraplegia and then halve the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> dose every three days. It is a reasonable alternative to treat these patients with a low-dose regimen based upon the available data suggesting therapeutic equivalence. Patients with pain but minimal neurologic dysfunction receive a bolus of 10 mg followed by 16 mg daily initially in divided doses. The dose is gradually tapered once definitive treatment is well underway. Patients with high-grade and symptomatic lesions likely need glucocorticoids even if they have relative contraindications. Patients with small epidural lesions without compression of the spinal cord and a normal neurologic examination may forgo the use of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H679512095\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of modality for definitive treatment depends on many factors, including the presence or absence of spinal instability, the degree of spinal cord compression, and the relative radiosensitivity of the tumor. An algorithmic approach to treatment based upon these factors is available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60269\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60269 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H679515503\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessing spinal stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important component of the decision making process when considering definitive therapy is assessment of spinal stability. Treatment of an ESCC differs in those patients whose spine is unstable compared to those with a stable spine. Pain from an unstable spine will not be relieved with radiotherapy, and there is a lack of evidence on whether spinal bracing is an effective technique for reducing pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, an unstable spine must be stabilized either by surgery with fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] or by percutaneous vertebral repair (in the absence of epidural disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>There has been no widely accepted definition of what constitutes an unstable spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Systematic reviews of the available literature could not definitively describe what constitutes neoplastic spinal instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Older approaches to defining spinal instability relied mainly on clinical features (ie, a diagnosis of spinal instability can be made clinically if the patient has pain on motion that is not present at rest) with support from diagnostic imaging.</p><p>A classification system for spinal instability in neoplastic disease has been developed based upon the available evidence and expert consensus opinion consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Systematic reviews of the literature were performed to identify the best evidence for clinical, radiographic, and pathologic factors that relate to neoplastic spinal instability in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. These reviews served as the framework to guide expert consensus from the Spine Oncology Study Group, an international group of 30 spine oncology experts from around the world. By consensus, the highest ranked factors predictive of spinal instability included <span class=\"nowrap\">subluxation/translation,</span> progression of deformity, greater than 50 percent vertebral body collapse, bilateral facet destruction, and movement-related pain (as opposed to tumor-related or biologic pain). The anatomic areas of greatest concern were junctional segments of the spine, including the occipitocervical, cervicothoracic, and thoracolumbar junctions. Consensus opinion was used to derive six individual components of spinal instability, which were scored, with a final Spine Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) representing a composite score of the individual components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80396 \">table 1</a>). According to this classification, patients with a score of 7 or higher are considered to be at risk for spinal instability and warrant surgical consultation. </p><p>The validity of the SINS was addressed in a cohort of 30 patients with spinal tumors that were classified as stable, potentially unstable, and unstable by members of the Spine Oncology Study Group (the same group that devised the classification scheme) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity rates of SINS for potentially unstable or unstable lesions were 96 and 80 percent, respectively. In addition, there was high inter- and intraobserver reliability in determining the three clinically relevant categories of stability. &#160;</p><p>While the published evidence was considered in deriving the SINS, this classification system is not evidence based and it reflects broad expert opinion of spinal neurosurgeons. In addition, it lacks independent prospective validation. Nevertheless, it represents a contemporary consensus approach to defining spinal instability. Regardless of the radiographic findings, the clinician should consider every patient with pain caused by movement to be unstable until proved otherwise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many years, posterior decompression using a laminectomy for patients with ESCC was the initial approach in the patient with neurologic compromise. However, retrospective comparisons of case series of patients treated with laminectomy with or without RT versus RT alone revealed no advantage to the surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An early small randomized trial found no difference in outcome between patients undergoing laminectomy followed by RT versus RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Since the bulk of tumor is usually located in the vertebral body anterior to the thecal sac, the failure of laminectomy to improve outcome substantially is not surprising. Laminectomy alone does not provide sufficient access to resect tumor anterior to the spinal cord and can result in iatrogenic progressive instability. Laminectomy without spine stabilization should be avoided, whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgical decompression and spine stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvements in surgical techniques led to the use of more aggressive tumor resections followed by spinal reconstruction for patients with ESCC. Promising results have been obtained by resecting the tumor from the epidural space using various methods, including anterior transcavitary, posterolateral, or combined approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Anterior reconstruction can be accomplished using either bone grafts or methylmethacrylate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. Methylmethacrylate has important advantages over bone grafting in view of the frequent need for postoperative RT, since RT can begin one week following methylmethacrylate but must be deferred for at least six weeks to allow for fusion after bone grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Posterior segmental fixation is now accomplished using screw-rod systems, including pedicle screws in the thoracic and lumbar spine and lateral mass screws in the cervical spine.</p><p>The benefit of integrating aggressive tumor resection to decompress the spinal cord and spine stabilization into the initial management was shown in a randomized trial that compared direct circumferential surgical decompression followed by RT (30 Gy over 10 days, starting within 14 days of surgery) with the same RT alone in 101 patients with metastatic ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Enrolled patients had a known cancer diagnosis (patients with lymphoma or a primary spine tumor were excluded), a single level of cord compression, and could not have been paraplegic for more than 48 hours. Both groups received the same initial dose of glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 100 mg initially, then 24 mg every six hours) and either began radiation or underwent surgery within 24 hours of presentation.</p><p>The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis, which showed that patients treated with surgery followed by RT had a significantly higher ambulatory rate (84 versus 57 percent with to RT alone) and retained the ability to walk significantly longer than those treated with RT alone (median 122 versus 13 days). In addition, 10 of 16 patients who were initially unable to walk regained the ability to ambulate after surgery, compared to 3 of 16 treated with RT alone. Three of 10 patients who failed to respond to RT regained the ability to walk after salvage surgery. The use of glucocorticoids and opioid analgesics was also reduced in those treated surgically.</p><p>A later unplanned subgroup analysis from this trial also suggested an important interaction between age and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Preservation of ambulation was significantly prolonged in surgically treated patients under the age of 65, but not in older individuals. This association has not been found in other analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A high complication rate is often observed in patients undergoing resection and stabilization after prior spine radiotherapy. In a series of 110 patients undergoing aggressive tumor resection for ESCC, 47 of whom had failed to respond to prior irradiation and 44 percent of whom were nonambulatory, postoperative complications occurred in 48 percent and were related statistically to age over 65 years, prior treatment, and presence of paraparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Others have questioned the role of surgery. A retrospective analysis compared outcomes among 108 patients receiving surgery plus RT and a matched cohort of 216 patients treated with RT alone; patients were matched for 11 potentially prognostic factors, including age, performance status, type of tumor, number of involved vertebrae, presence of other bone or visceral metastases at the time of RT, ambulatory status prior to RT, duration of motor deficits prior to RT, and the specific RT regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

It is still used for patients who are not considered surgical candidates and following surgical decompression. The RT portal covers the width of the vertebral body and all areas of paravertebral tumor extension with margin, is centered on the spine, and typically extends one vertebral body above and below the epidural metastasis. The necessity of including the adjacent vertebrae in the radiation treatment volume has been questioned, given the low rates of local failure (&lt;5 percent) in adjacent non-irradiated vertebral bodies in patients with isolated spinal metastases (without ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]); disadvantages of treating with just a margin on the disease (as opposed to one vertebral body above and below) include the difficulty in matching radiation fields if recurrences occur adjacent to the prior radiated field, the requirement of daily imaging when delivering EBRT with tighter margins, and the uncertainty of microscopic extent of disease once it has entered the epidural space.</p><p>RT is generally very well tolerated.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), also known as stereotactic radiosurgery, is a technique that utilizes precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing radiation to adjacent normal tissue. This targeting allows treatment of small- or moderate-sized tumors, even in close proximity to the spinal cord, in either a single or limited number of dose fractions. Although high doses can be delivered, normal tissue constraints are always respected, especially for the spinal cord. This frequently results in tumor adjacent to the spinal cord receiving a lower dose than tumor further away from the spinal cord.

We consider any radiologic evidence of indentation of the thecal sac to be evidence for ESCC. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p>The majority of cases arise from epidural extension of vertebral body metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.) </p><p>Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment are critically important in the preservation of neurological function in patients with epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC). (See <a href=\"#H679514895\" class=\"local\">'Impact of treatment delay on posttreatment ambulation'</a> above.)</p><p>The goals of treatment for patients with ESCC are pain control, avoidance of complications from local disease progression, and the preservation or improvement of neurologic functioning. The choice of definitive treatment must be appropriate to the patient's burden of disease, life expectancy, and values. An important component of the pretreatment decision making process is an assessment of spinal instability. (See <a href=\"#H679515503\" class=\"local\">'Assessing spinal stability'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with ESCC and either neurologic symptoms or substantial thecal sac compression by imaging, we recommend glucocorticoids as an integral component of the initial management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe neurologic deficits (eg, paraparesis or paraplegia), we suggest high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 96 mg intravenously followed by 24 mg four times daily for three days and then tapered over 10 days) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with minimal neurologic symptoms, we suggest moderate doses of glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> as a bolus of 10 mg intravenously followed by 16 mg daily orally in divided doses) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that glucocorticoids be omitted in patients with small epidural lesions and a normal neurologic examination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery, external beam RT, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are the primary approaches to treat tumor compressing the spinal cord.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgical decompression and spine stabilization'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following surgery, we suggest a relatively longer course of RT (eg, 30 Gy in 10 fractions) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

If there is evidence of high-grade cord compression, SBRT should not be undertaken, and surgical decompression followed by radiation therapy or by stereotactic radiosurgery is an appropriate option as long as the patient is well enough to tolerate the procedure, has a limited disease burden, and relatively favorable prognosis.
