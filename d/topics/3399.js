There is, however, wide interpatient variability as many patients will respond well to one drug but not to another. In addition, there are few clinical parameters that reliably predict individual responses to one drug or another. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Initial monotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of attained blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses published in 2008 and 2009, the 2015 American Heart Association statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] on the treatment of blood pressure in ischemic heart disease, and the 2013 European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Hypertension/European</span> Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of hypertension all concluded that the amount of blood pressure reduction is the major determinant of reduction in cardiovascular risk in both younger and older patients with hypertension, <strong>not</strong> the choice of antihypertensive drug (assuming that the patient does not have an indication for a particular drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, or a beta blocker for rate control in atrial fibrillation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/1,2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,8</a>].</p><p>This conclusion was based upon the finding in a number of large randomized trials that, at the same level of blood pressure control, most antihypertensive drugs provide the same degree of cardiovascular protection. As an example, the CAPPP, STOP-Hypertension-2, NORDIL, UKPDS, and INSIGHT trials found little overall difference in outcomes between older (such as diuretics and beta blockers) and newer antihypertensive drugs (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and calcium channel blockers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>], and the CAMELOT trial found no significant difference in outcomes with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a>, two newer antihypertensive drug classes at that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similar conclusions have been reached in patients at increased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>When differences in outcomes have been noted in trials comparing different antihypertensive drugs, the treatment strategy that produced better outcomes had also produced better blood pressure control. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ASCOT trial found a lower rate of cardiovascular disease and death with a calcium channel blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>) compared with a beta blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>).

When 5000 pairs were matched exactly for systolic blood pressure and other risk factors, the two groups had nearly identical rates of cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Possible exceptions to these general findings were thought to come from the ALLHAT and ACCOMPLISH trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ALLHAT trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ALLHAT trial randomly assigned over 41,000 hypertensive patients (mean blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">146/84</span> mmHg) with at least one other coronary risk factor to one of four initial regimens: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> (12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a>; the doxazosin arm was prematurely terminated due to an increased risk of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, the primary outcome (fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction) was the same in the three arms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82432\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82432 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the chlorthalidone arm had a significantly lower rate of heart failure than amlodipine and lisinopril (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68780\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68780 \">figure 4</a>) and a significantly lower rate of combined cardiovascular disease outcomes than lisinopril (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61612 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>It seems likely that the benefits seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> were due at least in part to an earlier and greater degree of blood pressure reduction, similar to the findings with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> in the VALUE trial described in the preceding section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Chlorthalidone was associated with a small but significantly lower systolic pressure over the course of the study than amlodipine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> (133.9 versus 134.7 and 135.9 mmHg, respectively) and a higher proportion of patients who attained the blood pressure goal of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg (68.2 versus 66.3 and 61.2 percent, respectively). The difference in mean systolic blood pressure was most pronounced in the first two years (136.4 versus 137.8 and 139.2 mmHg, respectively).</p><p>Twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring was not obtained in ALLHAT, which may have been important since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> is long acting, while the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> may diminish toward the end of the day, especially at doses of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. One cannot exclude the possibility that the observed benefits with chlorthalidone in ALLHAT were due at least in part to the lower attained blood pressure, which is in keeping with the findings in other trials cited in the preceding section.</p><p>Looking at the data in another way, there was no difference in the primary end point among the three treated groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82432\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82432 \">figure 3</a>), despite the lower attained blood pressure with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>. This raises the possibility that thiazide diuretics may actually be associated with worse outcomes at the same attained blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thiazide-like versus thiazide-type diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>, commonly used thiazide-like diuretics, are significantly more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, a commonly used thiazide-type diuretic, at similar dose levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 14 trials that compared the blood pressure reduction with one of three dose levels of hydrochlorothiazide (low, intermediate, high) to a similar dose level of one of the thiazide-like diuretics, systolic pressure reduction was greater with chlorthalidone and indapamide (by 3.6 and 5.1 mmHg, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>This may not be so important for efficacy, since the dose-response curve for thiazide diuretics in the treatment of primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) is relatively flat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61248 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23,24</a>]. However, metabolic complications, such as hypokalemia, glucose intolerance, and hyperuricemia increase with dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69912\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69912 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23,24</a>].

This may not affect office blood pressure if the medication is taken in the morning but may result in a greater fall in nighttime blood pressure with chlorthalidone compared to baseline (eg, -13.5 mmHg with 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [force titrated to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day]</span> versus -6.4 mmHg with 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [force titrated to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day]</span> of hydrochlorothiazide in a small randomized, crossover trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The lesser efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> throughout the day was also demonstrated in a study in which both 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and office blood pressure were performed in 228 hypertensive patients at baseline and after four weeks of therapy with hydrochlorothiazide (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In the absence of such head-to-head trials, a multiple-treatment (network) meta-analysis of 21 trials including approximately 120,000 patients was conducted in which thiazide-type diuretics (such as hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like diuretics (such as chlorthalidone) were indirectly compared by evaluating their efficacy against placebo or common comparator drugs (eg, ACE inhibitors were compared with hydrochlorothiazide in ANBP2 and with chlorthalidone in ALLHAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. After controlling for achieved blood pressure, thiazide-like but not thiazide-type diuretics reduced the risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) and heart failure (relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.89). Compared with thiazide-type diuretics, thiazide-like diuretics significantly lowered the relative risk of cardiovascular events by 12 percent and heart failure by 21 percent.</p><p>The results of this meta-analysis are consistent with an earlier network meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and with observational data from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among hypertensive men in MRFIT, 2392 were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and 4049 were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>. During six years of follow-up, cardiovascular events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass surgery, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, peripheral artery disease, or angina) were significantly less common with chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92). Through the course of the study, systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels were also lower with chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>By contrast, another observational study performed among 29,873 older adults (66 years and older) found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> was not associated with a reduced risk of death or cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, but was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for hypokalemia (hazard ratio 3.06, 95% CI 2.04 to 4.58) and hyponatremia (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nevertheless, the trial evidence supporting the efficacy of low-dose thiazide diuretics in the management of hypertension comes primarily from those using chlorthalidone, such as ALLHAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

There is, however, wide interpatient variability as many patients will respond well to one drug but not to another. There are some predictable differences, such as black patients and older patients generally responding better to monotherapy with a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker and relatively poorly to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or beta blocker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65117 \">figure 2</a>).

As examples, the average fall in systolic blood pressure over 24 hours with half-standard, standard, and twice-standard doses was 7.1, 9.1, and 10.9 mmHg with data from all classes combined and 7.4, 8.8, and 10.3 mmHg with a thiazide diuretic. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Drug dosing and drug frequency'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers, the rate of symptomatic and metabolic adverse effects increased significantly with standard or twice-standard doses compared to half-standard doses. Similar findings have been noted in other studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69912\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69912 \">figure 7</a>). By contrast, there was a very low rate of side effects with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with no dose dependence.</p><p/><p>Thus, after the initial dose, going to higher doses produced on average relatively small further reductions in blood pressure at the price of an increasing rate of adverse effects. As a result, we generally limit dose titration to one step with a given antihypertensive drug (eg, 12.5 to 25 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and 5 to 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>).</p><p>These observations suggest that two or even three drugs at half-standard doses might have greater antihypertensive efficacy and less toxicity than one drug at standard or twice-standard doses and might produce better patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Each of these classes of drugs has been equally effective in monotherapy trials if the attained blood pressure is similar. Beta blockers are <strong>not</strong> commonly used for initial monotherapy in the absence of a specific indication since they may have an adverse effect on some cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Clinical reasons for specific drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Importance of attained blood pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients in whom there is a reasonable likelihood of requiring a second drug (eg, more than <span class=\"nowrap\">10/5</span> mmHg above goal), some clinicians prefer initial therapy with a long-acting ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span> or a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker since the second class can be added if additional therapy is required to achieve the desired combination regimen. As described in the next section, the choice between these drug classes may be influenced by age and race. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'ACCOMPLISH trial'</a> above.)</p><p>This is different from the current practice of many clinicians. Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> (12.5 to a maximum of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is widely used and, after publication of the ALLHAT trial, was recommended as initial monotherapy in most patients with mild primary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. However, hydrochlorothiazide appears to be less effective and has a shorter duration of action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>, and there is little, if any, evidence that low-dose hydrochlorothiazide alone reduces cardiovascular events as opposed to the evidence with chlorthalidone. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Thiazide-like versus thiazide-type diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, when a diuretic is used either as initial therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive therapies, we and others suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> (12.5 to a maximum of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], which produced the best outcomes in ALLHAT, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> at the same doses.

Thus, in a patient who has little or no fall in blood pressure after an adequate dose of drug 1, switching to (rather than adding) drug 2 and, if this is ineffective, switching to drug 3 may allow as many as 60 to 80 percent of patients with stage 1 hypertension to initially be controlled with a single agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/48,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,52</a>].</p><p>There are no strict guidelines as to how to perform sequential monotherapy, although the following approach is reasonable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blood pressure response to initial monotherapy should be assessed in four to six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is an inadequate response, the dose can be increased and the blood pressure response assessed after another four-to-six-week period.

The preferred second drugs in patients who are treated with a beta blocker are a thiazide diuretic or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. An alpha blocker would be chosen only if there is another reason for its use, such as symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p><p>An ACE inhibitor or ARB is likely to be less effective in patients treated with a beta blocker since beta blockers reduce renin secretion and therefore angiotensin II formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], and a beta blocker should be used with caution in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and to a lesser degree <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>. These drugs can potentiate the cardiac depressant effect of the beta blocker, possibly leading to or exacerbating bradycardia or heart block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12238489\"><span class=\"h1\">BEDTIME VERSUS MORNING DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average nocturnal blood pressure is approximately 15 percent lower than daytime values. Failure of the blood pressure to fall by at least 10 percent during sleep is called &quot;nondipping,&quot; and is a stronger predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than daytime blood pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Nocturnal blood pressure and nondippers'</a>.)</p><p>In some studies, shifting at least one antihypertensive medication from the morning to the evening can both restore the normal nocturnal blood pressure dip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-95</a>] and reduce 24-hour mean blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

This conclusion also applies to patients at increased cardiovascular risk as shown in the ALLHAT, VALUE, and CAMELOT trials. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Importance of attained blood pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'ALLHAT trial'</a> above.)</p><p>However, there may be exceptions when using combination therapy.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'ACCOMPLISH trial'</a> above.)</p><p>Some hypertensive patients have underlying conditions for which specific antihypertensive drugs might offer particular benefit independent of blood pressure control, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, or a beta blocker for rate control in atrial fibrillation. The following recommendations do <strong>not</strong> apply to such patients.

Among such patients who do not have an indication for a specific drug, the major classes of drugs that have been used for monotherapy are a low-dose thiazide diuretic, long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/angiotensin</span> II receptor blocker (ARB), or a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the preference for an ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span> plus a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in patients requiring combination therapy, we suggest use of one of these drug classes as initial therapy so that the other can be added, if necessary (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If this approach is chosen, an ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span> may be more effective in younger patients, and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be more effective in older adult and black patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Initial monotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Monotherapy based upon age and race'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a diuretic is chosen, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Some clinicians, particularly in the United States, have limited, if any, experience with chlorthalidone and indapamide. The basic principles of monitoring for hypokalemia with these drugs are identical to those with hydrochlorothiazide.
