Adenocarcinoma in situ is the only known precursor to cervical adenocarcinoma, and appropriate management can prevent the occurrence of invasive disease in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The usual interval between clinically detectable adenocarcinoma in situ and early invasion appears to be at least five years, suggesting ample opportunity for screening and intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Glandular neoplasia of the uterine cervix is less common than squamous neoplasia, comprising one quarter of all annual cervical cancers diagnoses in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over the past few decades, however, the incidence of adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ are reviewed here. Related topics are discussed separately, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glandular cells on cervical cytology (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cytology: Evaluation of atypical and malignant glandular cells&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive adenocarcinoma of the cervix (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical adenocarcinoma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11311344\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average age of women at diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is 36.9 years, based upon a meta-analysis that included 33 studies with 1278 patients with a diagnosis of AIS on cervical cone biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) United States national cancer database reported that, from 1995 to 2000, the incidences of AIS among white and black women, respectively, in the United States were 1.25 and 0.31 per 100,000 woman-years, respectively; data regarding other racial or ethnic groups were not included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The incidences of both AIS and adenocarcinoma of the cervix have increased over the past several decades, particularly among young women. From 1976 to 1995, SEER data show a sharp increase particularly in white women, who had a sixfold rise from 0.21 to 1.25 per 100,000 woman-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Several factors have probably contributed to this increase, including: increased rates and efficacy of screening, changes in the Bethesda cervical cytology classification system that have better clarified glandular findings, and increased exposure to factors that cause or promote glandular neoplasia (high-risk human papillomavirus [HPV], oral contraceptives) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical and vaginal cytology: Interpretation of results (Pap test report)&quot;, section on 'Glandular cell abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>AIS and adenocarcinoma are less common than squamous cell cervical cancer (SCC) and its precursors. SEER data from 2001 to 2004 showed that among cervical cancer cases, 25 percent were adenocarcinoma and 70 percent SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The risk factors for AIS are the same as for invasive cervical adenocarcinoma, most notably HPV infection, particularly with subtypes 16 or 18; prolonged infection with high-risk HPV subtypes is also a risk factor for squamous cervical neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Some data suggest that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increased risk of AIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Risk factors for cervical adenocarcinoma are discussed in detail separately.

Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the cervix is characterized histologically by endocervical glands that exhibit a crowded, cribriform pattern and are lined with atypical columnar epithelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52908 \">picture 1</a>). The predominant histologic type is endocervical, although pagetoid AIS has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The pattern of AIS lesions vary, making diagnosis of the full extent of disease difficult in some cases. Lesions usually originate at the transformation zone with contiguous extension proximally within the endocervical canal. Ten to 15 percent of patients with AIS have multifocal disease (&quot;skip&quot; lesions) with foci of AIS that are separated by at least 2 mm of normal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. AIS lesions may also be located high in the endocervical canal and involve the deeper portions of the endocervical clefts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181231664\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the cervix is nearly always asymptomatic and is generally not visible upon gross examination. It is typically detected due to an abnormal finding on cervical cytology. </p><p>Rarely, women with AIS present with cervical bleeding, which is usually described by the patient as vaginal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The cervix can only be identified as the site of bleeding with pelvic examination. A postcoital pattern of bleeding has traditionally been associated with cervical neoplasia, although it appears that fewer than 1 in 2000 women with postcoital bleeding have cervical cancer. Women with cervical bleeding should be evaluated with cervical cytology. If the results are negative, the patient should be evaluated for other etiologies (eg, benign cervical lesion, cervicitis). Abnormal cytology results should be evaluated as appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postcoital-bleeding-in-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postcoital bleeding in women&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer#H546741441\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Follow-up of abnormal tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H852913\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIS is typically detected upon evaluation of abnormal findings on cervical cytology, as noted above. Either glandular or squamous cytologic abnormalities may precede a diagnosis of AIS.

The examination should include a speculum examination with visual inspection of the cervix. This examination will typically be negative in women with AIS, since AIS is a microscopic condition. If present, a grossly visible lesion should be biopsied to exclude malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer screening tests: Techniques for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus testing&quot;, section on 'Biopsy of visible lesions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women who present with genital tract bleeding, a complete pelvic examination should be performed to determine the source of the bleeding and other relevant findings (eg, uterine size and mobility).

AIS has no colposcopic features that differentiate it from other cervical lesions. We also perform endocervical curettage (ECC) in all women with a cytologic finding of glandular abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71416 \">table 1</a>) or a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

Women &gt;35 years old and younger women at risk of developing endometrial neoplasia, based on risk factors or symptoms, may be appropriate for endometrial sampling. </p><p>Women with squamous cytologic abnormalities with a negative biopsy and ECC should be evaluated as appropriate.

These include other types of glandular and squamous preinvasive and invasive disease. The type of cervical neoplasia is determined through cervical biopsy, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H7454927\" class=\"local\">'Colposcopy, biopsy, and endocervical curettage'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, some women with atypical glandular cells on cervical cytology are found to have endometrial carcinoma or, rarely, cancer at other sites (ovaries, colon). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cytology: Evaluation of atypical and malignant glandular cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cervical bleeding is a rare presentation of AIS, as noted above. However, abnormal genital tract bleeding is a common clinical complaint. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of women with genital tract bleeding, and cervical bleeding in particular, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;, section on 'Cervical bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H853442\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTDIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) diagnosed with colposcopic-directed biopsy or endocervical curettage (ECC) require cervical conization. The role of conization in these patients is to confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, exclude invasive disease, and exclude a coexistent squamous lesion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H853541\"><span class=\"h2\">Conization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conization may be performed using one of several techniques, including: cold knife conization (CKC), loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), or laser conization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no evidence that conization technique impacts outcomes. In our practice, we prefer CKC rather than LEEP, since CKC yields a specimen that has margins that are more easily interpretable than a LEEP specimen for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKC specimens typically have an increased depth and width [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LEEP specimens have significant thermal artifact at the edges, which may obscure assessment of the margins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKC specimens are usually in one piece, while LEEP specimens are often in several pieces. A single-piece specimen can be marked at the 12 o&rsquo;clock position, allowing the pathologist to report the anatomic location of a positive margin. </p><p/><p>Many women with AIS patients will undergo LEEP due to clinician preference, or more commonly, because there was no preoperative suspicion of glandular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>]. These patients are managed the same way as those who underwent CKC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Laser conization also results in thermal artifact, similar to LEEP, but the size of the specimen can be comparable to CKC. Use of laser conization is limited by need for specialized training and equipment.</p><p>Some surgeons perform endocervical curettage (ECC) at the time of conization. Data conflict regarding whether performing this provides additional information regarding the likelihood of residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. In our practice, we perform ECC above the cone, since it does not add to operative risk and potentially provides additional reassurance (if negative) or indicates the need for another excision (if positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Some women with AIS on colposcopically directed biopsy will not have AIS in the cone specimen. Nevertheless, these women have a histologic diagnosis of AIS and we manage them in the same manner as other patients with a cone with negative margins. </p><p>The management of women with AIS on conization is described below. (See <a href=\"#H181231671\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients whose conization specimen shows a squamous lesion alone or coexistent with AIS, we follow them as appropriate for the squamous finding. (See <a href=\"#H7455411\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of coexistent squamous neoplasia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7455411\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of coexistent squamous neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with AIS are found to have a coexisting squamous lesion (55 percent in a meta-analysis of 33 studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28,29</a>]. Squamous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma should be further evaluated and managed as appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181231671\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of women with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the cervix is challenging. Because of the pattern of disease distribution of AIS (multifocal, high in the endocervical canal, inside endocervical clefts), negative margins on a cone biopsy specimen or a negative endocervical curettage does not necessarily ensure that the lesion has been completely excised. This also makes it difficult to detect <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/recurrent</span> disease or adenocarcinoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15587586\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy is the standard treatment for AIS; the alternative is conization followed by surveillance. Unfortunately, women treated with conization alone have a high risk of residual AIS or adenocarcinoma, while the incidence of adenocarcinoma after hysterectomy is limited to rare case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The risk of residual disease is particularly high for women with a positive conization margin. </p><p>The best available data regarding the risk of residual AIS or adenocarcinoma following conization are from a meta-analysis of 33 observational studies including 1278 patients who were followed for an average of three years (range, one to five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among 60 patients who underwent subsequent conization or hysterectomy, the rates of residual AIS and adenocarcinoma were: initial conization margin positive (AIS: 52.8 percent; adenocarcinoma: 6.3 percent [17 of 266]) and initial conization negative (20.3 percent; 1.5 percent [4 of 341]). Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in an additional eight women (six with positive margins; two with negative margins) who were managed conservatively. The clinical importance of residual AIS is that it is likely to develop into invasive disease. However, progression may take five or more years and long-term data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Surveillance of women with AIS has not been proven effective in preventing progression to invasive disease or increasing survival for women with adenocarcinoma. The multifocal nature of AIS greatly limits the ability of testing with cervical cytology, colposcopy, biopsy, and endocervical sampling to detect residual disease or adenocarcinoma. </p><p>Given these considerations, for women with cervical AIS who do not wish to preserve fertility, we recommend hysterectomy rather than cervical conization alone for women with positive conization margins. For those with negative conization margins, there are few data. The risk of adenocarcinoma in these patients is approximately 1.8 percent, based upon low-quality data, while the risk of serious morbidity of extrafascial abdominal hysterectomy is 4 to 6 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79688 \">table 2</a>). We suggest hysterectomy for these patients. Conization followed by surveillance is an option for women who value avoiding the potential morbidity of hysterectomy more than avoidance of an approximately 1 percent risk of cervical adenocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy#H1745544\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>For women who wish to preserve fertility, conization followed by surveillance is a reasonable option <strong>only</strong> for women who have a negative conization margin (including a negative endocervical curettage) and who are willing to accept a higher risk of cervical adenocarcinoma. We recommend hysterectomy for women with a positive conization margin following two or more conizations. </p><p>These recommendations are consistent with guidelines from the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. </p><p>Based upon the complexity of managing AIS, treatment by a gynecologic oncologist is generally preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3010837\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysterectomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3011609\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with AIS are treated with a total extrafascial hysterectomy. Ovaries may be conserved.</p><p>If a laparoscopic approach is used, morcellation should be avoided. An intact specimen is important for evaluation of margins, particularly given the likelihood of skip lesions in AIS.</p><p>Prior to hysterectomy, for women who had positive margins on conization, we suggest a repeat conization procedure to exclude invasive disease. This avoids the possibility of performing only an extrafascial hysterectomy in the setting of an occult invasive cancer that should be staged and treated with a more radical surgical procedure. We repeat the conization procedure approximately six weeks prior to hysterectomy to allow for resolution of inflammation in and around the cervix. </p><p>Women in whom adenocarcinoma is discovered at time of hysterectomy should be managed as appropriate. Further surgical staging and treatment with radical parametrectomy and lymph node dissection may be required.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colposcopy&quot;, section on 'Vaginal colposcopy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>If HPV testing is positive and vaginal cytology negative, the HPV test and cytology are repeated at the next surveillance visit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3011617\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are rare reports of cervical adenocarcinoma in women treated for AIS with hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. These most likely represent adenocarcinoma that was not recognized at the time of hysterectomy, although in both of these cases the hysterectomy specimen showed AIS without evidence of invasive disease with negative margins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3010845\"><span class=\"h2\">Fertility preservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIS is a disease that affects many women of reproductive age, since the mean age at diagnosis is the late thirties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, many women with AIS desire to preserve fertility. Women who are candidates for conization followed by surveillance are those who have the lowest risk of developing adenocarcinoma, that is, those with a negative conization margin (including a negative endocervical curettage [ECC]). Women treated conservatively for AIS require close surveillance for cervical adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Oophorectomy is not required at time of hysterectomy for AIS. Women of reproductive age who have undergone hysterectomy and conserved their ovaries may be candidates for in vitro fertilization using a gestational carrier. (See <a href=\"#H3011609\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surrogate-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surrogate pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367110\"><span class=\"h3\">Conization margin status</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3011634\"><span class=\"h4\">Negative margin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a negative conization have a risk of residual AIS or adenocarcinoma of 20 and 1 percent, respectively, based upon data from hysterectomy or repeat conization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The risk of invasive disease is low, but is still higher than hysterectomy, after which there are only rare cases of adenocarcinoma. For women with these findings who desire fertility preservation, we offer management with conization followed by surveillance. Patients considering conservative management should be counseled about the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/recurrent</span> AIS or adenocarcinoma. </p><p>ECC is performed by some surgeons at the time of conization. We consider the ECC results to be part of the margin status (ie, a positive ECC is a positive margin). (See <a href=\"#H853541\" class=\"local\">'Conization'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6840447\"><span class=\"h4\">Positive margin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a positive conization margin who desire to preserve fertility should be evaluated with a repeat conization. We repeat the conization procedure approximately six weeks after the first conization to allow for sufficient healing and resolution of inflammation of the cervix. If the repeat conization margin is negative, we offer surveillance. </p><p>Women typically do not undergo more than two conization procedures. A third conization is sometimes technically feasible, but the risk of operative complications and preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancy increases with repeat procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Reproductive effects of treatment&quot;, section on 'Number of procedures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>We recommend hysterectomy for women with a positive conization margin following two or more conizations.

Postconization follow-up consists of cervical cytology and testing for high-risk HPV subtypes. </p><p>There are no data to establish the optimal surveillance schedule for women treated for AIS with conization alone. The following protocol is advised by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical cytology (with or without ECC) and high-risk HPV testing every six months.

Women with adequate and negative colposcopy and a negative ECC may resume the surveillance protocol described above. Patients with recurrent AIS or high-grade squamous dysplasia on colposcopic-guided biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ECC should undergo repeat cervical conization or hysterectomy. </p><p>After completion of childbearing, we suggest that women with AIS who were treated with conization alone undergo hysterectomy. Hysterectomy reduces the risk of adenocarcinoma almost entirely compared with a 1 to 5 percent risk following conization alone, as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (see <a href=\"#H181231671\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above). However, there are no data that have evaluated continued surveillance versus deferred hysterectomy in this patient population.</p><p>Women who have chosen fertility preservation are likely to have undergone testing every 6 to 12 months in the interval between AIS diagnosis and the end of childbearing. The period of time from diagnosis to completion of childbearing is at least one year, but may be as long as ten years or longer. Most studies of conservative management of AIS have followed patients for less than five years. Also, there are no data to guide treatment decisions based upon the results of interim testing. As an example, the largest series of women who chose treatment of AIS with conization to preserve fertility included only 101 women and had a follow-up period of an average of four years (range, four months to 12 years); there were no cases of adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Two of five women who ultimately underwent hysterectomy had residual AIS in the hysterectomy specimen and had also had a positive conization margin, but no data were given about whether surveillance findings were the indication for hysterectomy. Given the limited data, continued surveillance is a reasonable choice for women who have had consistently normal testing, particularly for five or more years, following conization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1702364\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1702372\"><span class=\"h4\">AIS or adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of developing persistent or recurrent AIS or invasive adenocarcinoma following conservative management varies by conization margin status. There is a lack of high-quality data regarding the outcomes of conservative management of AIS. A meta-analysis of 33 observational studies described above found a risk of adenocarcinoma of 1.5 percent for women with a negative margin on initial conization and 5.0 percent in those with a positive margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H181231650\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average age of women at diagnosis of AIS is 36.9 years. Over the past few decades, the incidence of AIS and invasive adenocarcinoma has increased. From 1995 to 2000, the incidences of AIS among white and black women in the United States, respectively, were 1.25 and 0.31 per 100,000 woman-years. (See <a href=\"#H11311344\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIS is nearly always asymptomatic and is not visible upon gross visual examination. It is typically detected with evaluation of an abnormal finding on cervical cytology. Either glandular or squamous cytologic abnormalities may precede a histologic diagnosis of AIS. (See <a href=\"#H181231664\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pattern of AIS lesions varies, making diagnosis of the full extent of disease difficult in some cases. Lesions usually originate at the cervical transformation zone and extend proximally within the endocervical canal. Most lesions are contiguous, but 10 to 15 percent of patients with AIS have multifocal disease (&quot;skip&quot; lesions). AIS lesions may also be located high in the endocervical canal and involve the deeper portions of the endocervical clefts. (See <a href=\"#H181231657\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIS is a histologic diagnosis made with cervical biopsy. Women with known or suspected AIS require cervical conization to confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, exclude invasive disease, and exclude a coexistent squamous lesion. In our practice, we prefer cold knife conization since it yields a specimen that has margins that are more easily interpretable than a loop electrosurgical excision procedure. (See <a href=\"#H853541\" class=\"local\">'Conization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with AIS who do not wish to preserve fertility and for those with positive conization margins, we recommend hysterectomy rather than cervical conization alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For those with negative conization margins, we suggest hysterectomy rather than conization alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conization followed by surveillance is an option for women who value avoiding the potential morbidity of hysterectomy more than avoidance of an approximately 1 percent risk of cervical adenocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H181231671\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with cervical AIS who wish to preserve fertility and are willing to accept a higher risk of cervical adenocarcinoma (see <a href=\"#H3010845\" class=\"local\">'Fertility preservation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conization followed by surveillance is a reasonable option for women with a negative conization margin (including a negative endocervical curettage). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with a positive conization margin should be evaluated with a repeat conization. We recommend hysterectomy rather than surveillance for women with a positive conization margin following two or more conizations<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that women with AIS who opted for fertility preservation undergo hysterectomy after completion of childbearing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Continued surveillance is a reasonable option for women who have had consistently normal testing, particularly for five or more years, following conization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes of conservative management of AIS vary by conization margin status. The rates of recurrent or persistent AIS and adenocarcinoma, respectively, in women with negative margins on initial conization are 20 and 1 percent and with positive margins are 53 and 5 percent. Long-term follow-up with cervical cytology and high risk HPV testing is required for women who do not undergo hysterectomy.
