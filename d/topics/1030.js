The process of controlling rodent populations is imperative to human health but poses challenges when the rodenticide compounds used are also toxic to humans and domestic animals. The ideal rodenticide is highly toxic to rodents in small amounts but relatively nontoxic in small quantities to non-target species. The anticoagulant rodenticides best fit this criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Anticoagulant rodenticides came into use in the 1940s with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. The emergence of warfarin-resistant rats prompted the development of superwarfarins, or long-acting anticoagulants such as brodifacoum, bromadiolone, and chlorophacinone. Because of their availability, anticoagulant rodenticides are also the most common cause of rodenticide poisoning exposures reported annually in resource-rich countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In the United States, brodifacoum is the most frequently used anticoagulant rodenticide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; however, global differences exist. In the United Kingdom, difenacoum, brodifacoum, and bromadiolone are most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the developing world, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> rodenticides has led to tragic inadvertent exposures in newborns as well as the ingestion of contaminated foodstuff with resultant fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Throughout the world, the overwhelming majority of anticoagulant rodenticide exposures occur in young children, who generally ingest small volumes and have no significant coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>].

Most long-acting rodenticide baits are sold at a lower concentration to the public, typically 0.0025 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, high concentration formulations that have &gt;90 percent anticoagulant ingredients are commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>First-generation anticoagulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and coumatetralyl have been in use as rodenticides since the 1940s. However, the appearance of warfarin-resistant rat populations prompted the development and use of second-generation agents, which due to the presence of a polycyclic side chain and higher lipid solubility are more potent with a longer duration of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. While many days of feeding on warfarin may be needed to kill a rodent, a single day's exposure to a second-generation agent is usually lethal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Also called &quot;superwarfarins&quot; or &quot;long-acting&quot; agents, the second generation anticoagulant rodenticides include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives: brodifacoum (D-Con), bromadiolone, difenacoum, and flocoumafen </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indanedione derivatives: chlorophacinone and diphacinone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466431236\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both first- and second-generation anticoagulants work by inhibiting vitamin K-1,25 epoxide reductase, which is required for the regeneration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> and subsequent activation (gamma-carboxylation) of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z. As such, immediate effects are not seen even after massive exposure to these agents, as time is required for the existing coagulation factor supply to decrease and fail to replenish. Laboratory evidence of coagulopathy is typically delayed for 24 to 48 hours after exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin K and the synthesis and function of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H454905298\" class=\"local\">'Toxicokinetics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454905298\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The toxicokinetics of anticoagulant rodenticides are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absorption</strong> &ndash; Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and long-acting anticoagulants are well-absorbed orally and extensively protein-bound. Most undergo hepatic p450 metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,11,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,14-16</a>]. Inhalational absorption can occur with occupational exposure. Dermal absorption has also been described in a fatal newborn epidemic of warfarin-contaminated talcum powder and in adults with prolonged dermal exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>]. However, poisoning with coagulopathy most commonly occurs after ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Onset of action</strong> &ndash; The onset of coagulopathy requires coagulation factor activity to drop below 30 percent of normal. The depletion of factor VII, the vitamin K-dependent factor with the shortest plasma half-life (three to five hours), produces the first signs of coagulopathy. Laboratory evidence of coagulopathy (elevated prothrombin time [PT] and international normalized ratio [INR], decreased prothrombin levels) is usually evident within 48 hours after exposure; however, long-acting rodenticide poisoning may exhibit significant latency of several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Second-generation agents have a much longer duration of effect, which is attributable to a number of factors including hepatic accumulation, high lipid solubility, and prolonged elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of effect and elimination</strong> &ndash; The duration of effect depends upon the elimination rate of a given compound. Although kinetics distort unpredictably in overdose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> has a much shorter elimination half-life than long-acting anticoagulants, and there is significant variability between long-acting agents. In overdose, warfarin follows a first-order elimination curve with a half-life of 21.7 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Second-generation anticoagulants demonstrate zero-order, saturation-dependent kinetics in overdose. Half-lives of brodifacoum in overdose demonstrate a biphasic pattern, with initial values of 0.75 days followed by a half-life ranging from 16 to 62 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454905304\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXIC DOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We encourage consultation with a regional poison control center to help determine the potential toxicity of any anticoagulant rodenticide exposure.

These agents have been well described as a means of producing bleeding in cases of malicious poisoning, factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome), and medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). Specific levels of anticoagulant rodenticides can be obtained when these diagnoses are suspected to confirm exposure.

(See <a href=\"#H454905298\" class=\"local\">'Toxicokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Large ingestions, often suicidal in nature and involving consumption of bait pellets by adolescents and adults, can lead to profound and prolonged anticoagulation with serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and intracranial bleeding commencing at 24 to 48 hours after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19,21,22</a>].

Laboratory evidence of coagulopathy is typically delayed for 24 to 48 hours after exposure. (See <a href=\"#H454905286\" class=\"local\">'Formulations and chemical agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H466431236\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients examined within 24 hours of exposure will <strong>not</strong> have yet developed coagulopathy and should <strong>not</strong> be expected to have signs of bruising or bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H454905322\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large ingestions, often suicidal in nature and involving consumption of bait pellets by adolescents and adults, can lead to profound and prolonged anticoagulation with serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and intracranial bleeding commencing at 24 to 48 hours after exposure. The most common area of significant bleeding seen after exposure is frank hematuria with abdominal or flank pain. (See <a href=\"#H454905322\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory evaluation of patients with anticoagulant rodenticide exposure varies according to the estimated ingested dose and the type of exposure (see <a href=\"#H454905328\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No laboratory assessment is needed in children or older patients with clearly unintentional ingestion of nontoxic amounts of anticoagulant rodenticides who are not on anticoagulant therapy or who do not have an underlying medical conditions (eg, liver disease) that is associated with abnormal coagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with unintentional toxic exposures and who are otherwise healthy and not receiving anticoagulant therapy warrant measurement of prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) at 48 to 72 hours after exposure. Patients on anticoagulant therapy or with underlying medical conditions (eg, liver disease) that may be associated with abnormal coagulation should have a baseline measurement of PT and INR as soon as possible after the ingestion and repeated measurement 48 to 72 hours after exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that patients with intentional (self-harm, abuse, or malicious intent) or chronic ingestions, regardless of reported amount, undergo measurement of a PT, an INR, and a partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) during the initial presentation to the emergency department. Patients who are suicidal should also undergo laboratory assessment for coingestants based upon clinical findings and warrant measurement of an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> level even if asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additional studies should be obtained in patients with any evidence of bleeding on physical examination or coagulopathy on laboratory testing and include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Complete blood count with differential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Type and screen for blood products or, if significant bleeding, type and cross match</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Urine dipstick for blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Plasma fibrinogen and serum fibrin degradation products</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Stool for guaiac</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other laboratory or imaging studies may also be indicated depending upon the specific sites of bleeding (eg, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and ultrasound or computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen for major genitor-urinary bleeding; CT of the head for intracranial bleeding).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific anticoagulant levels are difficult to obtain in a timely enough fashion to guide clinical management of acute overdoses, and are primarily used to confirm exposure (eg, patients with factitious disorder or deliberate administration of a rodenticide as part of medical child abuse or other criminal activity).

The diagnosis of anticoagulant rodenticide <strong>poisoning</strong> is made when coagulopathy is identified by clinical bruising and bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged PT and INRs obtained 36 to 48 hours after ingestion. The presence of measurable rodenticide levels in the blood also establishes the diagnosis.
