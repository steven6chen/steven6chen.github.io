Cardiac symptoms, (eg, chest pain and tachycardia) are common, as are neurologic (eg, headaches and dizziness) and gastrointestinal (eg, epigastric pain) symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1043514\" class=\"local\">'Somatic features and utilization of medical services'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with panic attacks can develop agoraphobia, ie, anxiety about and avoidance of situations where help may not be available or where it may be difficult to leave the situation in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With revision of the DSM from the fourth to fifth edition, agoraphobia is diagnosed independently of panic disorder. Agoraphobia and its co-occurrence with panic disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Agoraphobia in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panic disorder is a recurrent or chronic disease in the majority of cases. Predictors of remission include female gender, absence of ongoing life stressors, low initial frequency of attacks, and sub-threshold panic. (See <a href=\"#H191515174\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to making a diagnosis of panic disorder, organic etiologies for symptoms of panic should be considered. Medical conditions that can mimic panic attacks include angina, arrhythmias, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolus, thyroid disease and, very rarely, temporal lobe epilepsy or pheochromocytoma. Substances that may trigger or worsen panic disorder include excessive caffeine use or the use of other stimulants, including certain drugs of abuse. (See <a href=\"#H9381794\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H628208005\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Wayne Katon, MD, who passed away in March 2015.
