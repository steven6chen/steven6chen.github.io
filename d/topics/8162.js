Nevertheless, a substantial number of children have chronic HCV infection and are at risk for complications. According to one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], there are approximately 115 million infected persons in the world, 11 million of whom are younger than 15 years of age. Eighty million are viremic, of whom 5 million are younger than 15 years of age. It has been estimated that the global health care costs for HCV-infected children and their families are hundreds of millions of dollars annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The major issues related to HCV in children will be reviewed here.

The prevalence rate in children is based upon screening tests performed on a nationally representative sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In comparison, the frequency of cases that are clinically identified is far lower (5 percent of the expected number), suggesting that screening for and case identification of pediatric HCV are grossly inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The proportion of children who are HCV antibody-positive who are also HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)-positive is not known precisely; based upon studies in adults, it is estimated to be approximately 75 to 80 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of concern, rates of acute HCV infection among young people appear to be increasing in the United States, particularly in suburban populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This pattern mirrors the epidemic of prescription opioid and subsequent heroin use in these areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H2080842934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Incidence and prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence is much higher (50 to 95 percent) in individuals who received blood products for conditions such as thalassemia or hemophilia before the advent of routine screening of blood products, which began in the United States in the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In the early- to mid-1990s, seroprevalence rates of 10 to 20 percent were reported among children with a variety of other potential exposures such as malignancy, hemodialysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or surgery for congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. In the late 1990s, a 2 percent seroprevalence rate was found in an incarcerated juvenile population in Washington, DC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most of these at-risk children are now young adults, as routine testing of the blood supply in developed countries has virtually eliminated transmission via this route.</p><p>There appears to be worldwide geographic variation in the prevalence of HCV infection in children, the reasons for which are incompletely understood. Studies in the early 1990s (which reflected populations of children who could have been exposed to contaminated blood products) reported prevalence rates ranging from 0 percent in Japan and Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], 0.4 percent in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], 0.6 percent in Malaysia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], 0.9 percent in Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], 1.4 percent in Moldova [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and up to 14.5 percent in Cameroon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Prevalence rates in Egypt were low in the 1990s among children without a history of exposure to blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but series from 2007 reported infection in 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Perinatal transmission is by far the most common source of HCV infection in children, probably accounting for more than 1500 new <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/year</span> in the United States, although many of these cases remain undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The incidence of HCV vertical transmission is approximately 1 to 5 percent in HCV-RNA-positive mothers, with the highest risk in mothers with high HCV viral load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risk is further increased for mothers with untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;</a>). Other individuals acquire the infection during adolescence, through high-risk behaviors such as intravenous or intranasal drug use and use of shared tattoo equipment. </p><p>The epidemiology of HCV infection in developed countries is changing. As an example, the prevalence of HCV infection among Italian children dropped by more than 40 percent in the late 1990s, and all new cases appeared to reflect perinatal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Some of this change is attributable to elimination of transfusion-associated hepatitis because of donor screening programs. In addition, several factors may have contributed to reductions in vertical transmission observed in some populations. One such factor is that fewer women of childbearing age are infected with HCV due to prevention campaigns; other factors include aging of women infected by transfusions and changing patterns of drug abuse. In addition, antiretroviral therapy in <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV</span> coinfected women reduces the rate of vertical transmission by HCV-infected women. The advent of highly effective direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV has the potential to further reduce the rates of HCV in children, if reproductive-aged women with HCV can be identified and treated prior to conception. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of HCV in children is incompletely understood. Because the disease generally progresses slowly, serious consequences such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma are rare during childhood. The following general observations have emerged from natural history studies in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections acquired during infancy (either by transfusion or through perinatal transmission) are most likely to clear spontaneously, with spontaneous clearance rates ranging from 20 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/4,31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31-37</a>]. Those with perinatally acquired HCV have rates of clearance on the lower end of this range. By contrast, HCV acquired later in life is less likely to clear spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Factors associated with disease progression'</a> below.)</p><p>One of the largest series with long-term follow-up in perinatally acquired HCV included 266 children who were followed for a median of 4.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Approximately 20 percent cleared the infection while 80 percent had chronic infection. Clearance was less likely in children who remained polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive after the first year of life and those who were persistently PCR-positive during the first year of life. Most children with chronic infection were asymptomatic. Hepatomegaly was observed in 10 percent.</p><p>There is also some evidence that the risk of developing chronic infection may be lower in patients presenting with symptomatic acute HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults#H164590471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for viral clearance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many patients, hepatic fibrosis scores tend to increase with age, suggesting there is slowly progressive histologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. The development of advanced liver disease is uncommon until more than 30 years after infection in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, progression to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis during childhood occasionally occurs, as described in the following case series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 121 treatment-naive children with hepatitis C, 80 percent had some fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This was usually mild, but five patients had bridging fibrosis and two had cirrhosis. The patients with advanced fibrosis tended to be older, suggesting that fibrosis increases with time. Obesity and perhaps other cofactors probably contribute to the severity of the liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 332 children with hepatitis C and persistent viremia, six children progressed to decompensated cirrhosis; the duration of infection before cirrhosis was noted was 2 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Five of the six children were infected with genotype 1a HCV and only one was coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, we have seen three children who developed decompensated cirrhosis at ages 11, 13, and 16, respectively. Three children with decompensated HCV-associated cirrhosis at ages 4, 6, and 11 years have also been reported by other centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In all of these children, the HCV infection was acquired perinatally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors associated with disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors associated with disease progression have been described, although the strength of these associations is unclear. Clinical predictors for disease progression in adults are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Perinatal transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatally acquired (&quot;vertically transmitted&quot;) HCV infection is the major route of new infections in children in developed countries. The risk of transmitting the virus from an HCV-infected woman to her infant is 1 to 5 percent, with higher rates if the mother is coinfected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The infants who are infected commonly have elevated serum aminotransferases for a few years that often become normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Ten to 20 percent of children with perinatally acquired HCV infection clear the virus during the first two years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>]. Estimated rates of spontaneous clearance vary, probably because different standards are used to define the infected status at birth; one small series suggested spontaneous clearance rates of up to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Almost all children who remain viremic after two years of age have chronic hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/35,38,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38,50,51</a>]. The risk factors for perinatal transmission of HCV are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other factors associated with disease progression have been identified, including immunosuppression (from HIV infection or other causes), chronic alcohol ingestion, obesity, and possibly by viral factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Universal screening for childhood HCV infection is not warranted in most communities. This was suggested by a review of 1034 children seen in an urban pediatric hospital; only one child was found to be HCV-positive, although some members of the population screened had risk factors for HCV disease (7 percent of the children's mothers had a history of blood transfusion, and 1.8 percent had a history of intravenous drug use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>However, selected screening is appropriate for the following groups of individuals who are at increased risk for HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/4,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,55</a>]. Screening consists of HCV antibody testing (except in infants &lt;18 months of age, as noted below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with clinical evidence of hepatitis, including unexplained elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aspartate aminotransferase (AST), even if asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children whose mothers are known to be infected with HCV or have a history of intravenous drug use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For these infants, testing for HCV antibody should be performed after 18 months of age because the results of this test in younger infants may reflect passive transfer of maternal antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If earlier diagnosis is desired, testing for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) may be performed at four months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, viremia at this age does not always predict long-term infection, since some of these infections spontaneously resolve by age three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are international adoptees or refugees, because most children adopted into the United States in more recent years have come from countries with relatively high prevalence rates, including Africa, China, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, and because risk factors for infection rarely are known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents or children who are victims of a sexual assault, or adolescents with a history of multiple sexual partners.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents with a history or suspicion of illicit injection drug use. A high index of suspicion for this possibility is appropriate in the United States, given the unfolding epidemic of opioid and subsequent heroin use, especially in nonurban populations.

Initial diagnostic evaluation for chronic HCV typically begins with an antibody test. A reactive or <span class=\"nowrap\">indeterminate/equivocal</span> antibody test should be followed by HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing. If HCV RNA is detected, the diagnosis of HCV infection is confirmed. These patients should be further evaluated to determine the genotype and extent of disease, then monitored for disease progression or spontaneous clearance, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2998984414\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent monitoring'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If HCV RNA is not detected, then a reactive antibody likely represents either a past HCV infection that subsequently was cleared, or a false-positive antibody test.

Perinatal transmission is by far the most common source of infection in children, although there is a reemergence of acquired HCV infection in adolescents and young adults in the United States, mirroring the epidemic of prescription opioid and subsequent heroin use. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for HCV is generally recommended in children of mothers known to be infected with HCV or with a history of intravenous drug use. Testing also should be performed in young adults who received blood products prior to 1992. Testing also is recommended for children who are international adoptees or refugees. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV generally progresses slowly in children, although there are exceptions. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of chronic HCV is rapidly evolving. The development of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represents a major milestone in the treatment of HCV in adults and is likely to transform practice in children in the near future. These agents permit effective, well-tolerated, all-oral, interferon-free regimens for most patients. Adults with chronic HCV are routinely and effectively treated with such regimens, and some are available to adolescents 12 years and older. These are likely to be available for younger children in the near future. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management of chronic HCV'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children younger than 12 years of age with HCV, we suggest <strong>deferring treatment</strong> until all-oral DAA regimens become available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Deferring treatment for several years or more is appropriate because most pediatric patients have mild HCV liver disease that progresses slowly, and because the conventional regimen of pegylated interferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ribavirin</a> has common and potentially significant side effects. (See <a href=\"#H2749605532\" class=\"local\">'Children &lt;12 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adolescents 12 years and older, treatment options are to proceed with a DAA regimen that is approved for this age group, or to enroll in a clinical trial of DAAs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113050\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113050 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3775107598\" class=\"local\">'Regimen selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with genotypes 1, 4, 5, or 6, we recommend treatment with an effective DAA regimen rather than using an interferon-based regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Options for accessing an effective DAA regimen include treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ledipasvir-and-sofosbuvir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a> (which is approved in the United States for this age group), or enrolling in a clinical trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with genotypes 2 or 3, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-and-velpatasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> is the preferred treatment regimen for adults, but velpatasvir is not yet approved in the United States for adolescents. An alternative option is the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sofosbuvir</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ribavirin</a>, but this regimen has potential adverse effects of ribavirin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) should be excluded prior to initiating treatment with a DAA regimen, and pregnancy should be excluded prior to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ribavirin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3939846920\" class=\"local\">'Precautions and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HCV and their families should be counseled about the specific routes of HCV transmission (perinatal transmission and via infected blood), and given advice to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58787\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58787 \">table 1</a>).
