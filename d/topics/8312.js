It is characterized by acute longing and preoccupying thoughts of home.</p><p>Almost all children, adolescents, and adults experience some degree of homesickness when they are apart from familiar people and environments. In some individuals, the subjective distress and level of impairment related to this separation may be extreme.</p><p>Primary care providers can help families understand the etiology of homesickness, identify which children are at risk, and develop strategies for prevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment. An overview of homesickness, including techniques for prevention with planned separations, such as summer camp and university study, and treatment strategies for unanticipated or traumatic separations, such as hospitalization, will be presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homesickness is defined as the distress and functional impairment caused by an actual or anticipated separation from home and attachment objects such as parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Severe homesickness is classified as an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood according to the American Psychiatric Association taxonomy (diagnostic code 309.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Homesickness is characterized by recurrent cognitions focused on home (eg, parents, house, loved ones, home cooking, family pet); it is always precipitated by an actual or anticipated separation from home. These features distinguish homesickness from other adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders, as well as from the separation anxiety felt by children when caregivers leave home (eg, because of divorce, military service, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals experience some degree of homesickness when they leave familiar surroundings and enter a new environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Homesickness may be a significant source of distress and impairment for children and adolescents in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Summer camp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boarding school</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">College/university</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletic training programs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital admission</p><p/><p>Homesickness also affects immigrants, foreign students, foreign employees, displaced persons, refugees, and military personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of homesickness vary depending upon the definition of homesickness, the population studied, the circumstances of separation, the type of measurement, and when the homesickness was assessed (eg, during a separation or retrospectively). As an example, estimates for homesickness among adolescent boarding school students range from 16 to 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the studies where homesickness was measured during the separation, the reported prevalence ranged from 83 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>].</p><p>Homesickness is equally prevalent among children attending summer camp and those who are hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. Younger children are at greater risk for homesickness than older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence and intensity are similar between boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,22</a>].</p><p>Approximately 20 percent of boys and girls who are away from home experience moderate to severe homesickness (defined by rating the average intensity of their homesickness at or above the midpoint of the rating scale used in the particular study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,20,21</a>]. However, only 6 to 9 percent of children report homesickness that is associated with severe symptoms of depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,6,9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,9,20</a>].</p><p>Homesickness in hospitalized children is more severe and less predictable than in children in less stressful environments. Across a variety of presenting problems, approximately 50 percent of hospitalized children ages 8 to 18 reported moderate to severe levels of homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The best predictors of homesickness were negative hospitalization attitudes and previous separations from home (eg, placement in foster care). In contrast to children in other settings, homesickness in hospitalized children was not predicted by insecure attachment or low perceived control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Data regarding the incidence and severity of homesickness in children with cognitive or developmental delay are lacking. However, it can be inferred that these children respond to separation from home and attachment objects in a manner consistent with their developmental age, separation attitudes, attachment style, aversion to change, and previous experiences away from home.</p><p>Among students at college or university, homesickness prevalence varies between 19 and 70 percent, again depending on the population and methodology. A longitudinal study of 174 first-year university students in the central United States found that 94 percent reported some homesickness in their initial 10 weeks at school, thus confirming the near universality of missing home during a separation in a novel setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for homesickness in both children and young adults include lack of experience with separation or the new environment, negative attitudes toward the separation or the environment, insecure attachment to the primary caregiver, and little or no involvement in the decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These risk factors fall into four interrelated categories: experience, attitude, personality, and family.</p><p>Most of the information regarding these factors is derived from studies in adults, particularly the information about personality factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, increasing information regarding the etiology of homesickness in children and adolescents is becoming available. A theoretical model suggests a distinction between the feelings associated with the loss of home (eg, grief) and the feelings associated with adjustment to a novel environment (eg, social anxiety) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experience factors &ndash; In studies of children at summer camps and boarding schools, the experience factors most predictive of homesickness include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27-29</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Little previous experience away from home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Little or no previous experience at the camp or school (lack of familiarity, social support, and connections)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Young age</p><p/><p>Age is often a proxy for experience, which is the more powerful predictor of homesickness. An eight-year-old child with lots of experience away from home, as an example, is at lower risk to become homesick at summer camp than a 12-year-old with little experience away from home. Experience is probably most valuable when it refines coping strategies. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Coping strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast, previous experience away from home does not protect against homesickness in hospitalized children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation suggests that the types of prior separation experiences shape expectations of future separations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If early separations are negative experiences (as may be the case with foster placements and traumatic hospitalizations), then expectations of future separations may be negative, predisposing to homesickness, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attitude factors &ndash; Beliefs that homesickness will be strong, coupled with negative first impressions and low expectations for the new environment, are powerful predictors of homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Expectations of intense homesickness and negative experiences can become self-fulfilling prophecies. This was illustrated in a study of college freshmen in whom perceived absence of social support was a strong predictor of homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A child's attitudes regarding separation are largely shaped by his or her history of time spent away from home. In a study of boys ages 8 to 16 who spent two weeks at camp, a combination of little previous experience away from home, low perceived control (discussed below), negative attitudes about the separation, and high expectations of homesickness accounted for nearly 70 percent of the variance in the intensity of homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personality factors &ndash; Insecure attachment to primary caregivers is the most frequent personality risk factor for homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In particular, children and adolescents with an anxious-ambivalent attachment style are likely to experience significant distress upon separation from home. Secure attachment, on the other hand, is associated with independence, a proclivity to explore, and social skills, all of which help young people adjust to a novel environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two other personality factors that increase the risk of homesickness in children and adolescents are low perceived control and anxious or depressed feelings in the months before a separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adults, homesickness is predicted by low self-directedness, high harm avoidance, rigidity, neuroticism, low self-esteem, and a &quot;fantasy&quot; or &quot;wishful thinking&quot; coping style [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/25,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31,32</a>]. However, it is not clear whether these personality factors can be generalized to predict homesickness in children and adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Coping strategies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family factors &ndash; The family factor most predictive of homesickness is low &quot;decision control&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A child who is forced by his or her parents to spend time away has little decision control and is more likely to feel homesick upon separation than a child who had a say in the separation's type and timing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other family factors that are weaker predictors of homesickness include caregivers who express anxiety or ambivalence about the separation (eg, &quot;Have a great time at camp. I don't know what I'll do without you&quot;) and the presence of an unresolved negative life event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conventional wisdom holds that a recent move, divorce, or similarly disruptive event might predispose a child to homesickness. However, this assumption is not supported by research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is plausible that if children have had a chance to process the thoughts and emotions associated with a recent negative life event, they are not at increased risk for homesickness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with homesickness present with withdrawn or depressed behaviors (eg, tearfulness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,6,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,33</a>]. However, some children present atypically with externalizing behaviors (eg, anger, irritability, fighting, swearing, or destroying property) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,6,7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7,20</a>]. Other children and adolescents may present with somatic complaints.</p><p>Of the children who somaticize their distress, only a small percentage present to a medical provider during the separation. In one study of 1412 consecutive visits to a summer camp health center by boys and girls aged 6 to 15 years, only 2 percent were classified as &quot;psychiatric&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Severe homesickness is associated with social problems, behavior problems, significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, coping deficits, and feelings of helplessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,11,20,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,20,35-37</a>].</p><p>In academic settings, homesickness among adolescents and young adults can be associated with nontraumatic ailments, such as stomach aches and headaches (some of which are undoubtedly somatization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>], academic difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/32,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,41-43</a>], absentmindedness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/38,39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,41,42</a>], low self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,44</a>], social anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], loneliness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obsessive thoughts and behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. These factors are generally thought to be sequelae of homesickness, though some, such as social problems, can also be precipitants of homesickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longitudinal changes in the intensity of homesickness in children and adolescents have been studied in children and adolescents attending summer camp or requiring hospitalization and in young adults attending university for the first time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4,6,9,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,9,20,24</a>]. In these populations, two trajectories of homesickness have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The least homesick 80 percent of children and adolescents begin their stay away from home with a low level of homesickness and maintain that level throughout their time away. This appears to be the case for two-, four-, and seven-week stays at overnight camp, as well as for the initial 10-week term at university.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most homesick 20 percent of children and adolescents begin their stay with an elevated level of homesickness, and the intensity increases over the course of several weeks, decreasing somewhat just before reuniting with their caregivers. With preventive interventions, this trajectory can be altered significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The longitudinal course of homesickness for children and adolescents in other environments, such as refugee camps and foster homes, is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most useful diagnostic tool is simply asking the question, &quot;How homesick have you been feeling?&quot; coupled with questions about functional impairment, such as behavioral withdrawal, insomnia, and loss of appetite. Asking direct questions about homesickness as part of a broader assessment of positive and negative moods, even on a daily basis, does not worsen symptoms of homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Quite the opposite: It puts adult caregivers, and sometimes peers, in a better, more educated position to help.</p><p>Homesickness may be comorbid with other behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and physical problems that warrant clinical attention. However, it has a well-documented deleterious effect on adjustment, over and above pre-existing negative adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, injuries or illnesses that occur during a separation may exacerbate or induce homesickness. Thus, it is important to exclude any contemporaneous but distinct physical ailments (eg, menstrual pain, influenza, otitis media), before attributing complaints to homesickness-related somatization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary care clinicians and parents can work together to prevent homesickness. Anticipatory guidance regarding homesickness can be provided during the following types of office visits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination before camp, boarding school, or <span class=\"nowrap\">college/university</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of care following a recent move (whether from a nearby town or from a different country)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prehospitalization evaluation</p><p/><p>Anticipatory guidance should emphasize homesickness as a normal feeling and include strategies for prevention. Talking about homesickness does not cause homesickness but helps children or adolescents to understand it and encourages them to utilize effective coping strategies while they are away [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Normalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Separation from home is a normal developmental milestone, and an upcoming separation should be framed as a positive developmental experience, especially in the case of a planned separation. It is important for children and adolescents to know they are likely to miss certain aspects of home when they are away. Such feelings are normal and indicate there are things about home they love and to which they are attached. Qualitative analyses have confirmed that, for most people, the familiar concept of &quot;home&quot; is associated with a comfortable and safe environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Planned separations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For planned separations (eg, boarding school, overnight camp, university), the primary care provider can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help families assess their son or daughter's readiness to spend time away from home. Knowing when the time is right for a planned separation is the cornerstone of homesickness prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. If conversations with a parent or child suggest great anxiety about a planned separation, the parents may want to consider postponing the separation until they and child are more comfortable with it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about previous separations; little previous experience away from home or with the particular new environment is predictive of homesickness.

The clinician can then coach the parents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77922 \">table 2</a>) and hospital staff (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66701 \">table 3</a>) regarding ways to bolster the child's coping skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Thus, it is essential that parents and clinicians convey positive expectations about the helpful outcomes of the hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Anecdotal evidence also suggests that orienting children to the hospital unit, to various medical procedures, and to the staff who will be caring for them reduces anxiety and minimizes homesickness.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distraction and social connection (eg, doing something fun, like playing with friends, to forget about homesick feelings)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact with home (eg, writing a letter or looking at a family picture to feel closer to home)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social support (eg, going to see someone whom they can talk with to help them feel better)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimism (eg, thinking about good things, like activities and friends, to feel better)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perspective (thinking that the time away is short, to make the time go by faster)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive avoidance (trying not to think about home and loved ones to forget about homesickness)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vicarious social support (thinking about what loved ones would say to help)</p><p/><p>Boys and girls report using these strategies with nearly equal frequency, except for social support, which girls report using more often than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Additional studies have identified strategies that are not helpful (eg, relinquished control, fantasy, delinquent behavior, escape) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/31,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35,36</a>]. Few children respond to the stress of separation from home with these approaches, but some, particularly boys, may try. The ineffective strategies are mentioned here so that caregivers can steer children away from them and toward something more helpful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relinquished control (eg, doing nothing because of a belief that nothing would help make things better)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fantasy or wishful thinking (eg, wishing that camp or school would end tomorrow)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing something angry or mean to get sent home (aggressive or delinquent behavior)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Escape (eg, trying to get home)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Contact with home</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Professional opinions are mixed and research is scant regarding phone calls and email contact during planned separations. The kind and frequency of child-caregiver contact should ultimately be dictated by the goals of the separation.</p><p>At summer camps, for example, anecdotal evidence suggests that phone calls and text messages exacerbate homesickness during stays of less than four weeks. Such real-time correspondence also erodes the burgeoning independence that camps and trips are designed to nurture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Thus, parents should be strongly discouraged from insisting they talk with their homesick child during a short stay away. It is likely that such contact will increase the distress for both parties.</p><p>Handwritten letters may be the best way to maintain contact with home. Letters lack the emotionally evocative quality of a phone call, and they require narrative reflection, which promotes understanding of one's experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Such reflection may even serve a therapeutic function, as does keeping a journal.</p><p>During longer separations (eg, camp stays longer than four weeks, boarding school, <span class=\"nowrap\">college/university),</span> phone calls, texts, and emails do not seem to interfere with the child or adolescent's enjoyment of the experience and may decrease homesickness intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], despite their evocative nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and the inherent risk that too much contact with home hinders new social connections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Pick-up deals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under no circumstances of planned, recreational separations from home should parents make a &quot;pick-up deal&quot; with their child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/1,48,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,48,55</a>]. Promising, &quot;If you don't like it, I'll come pick you up,&quot; reduces the child's likelihood of success for several reasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subtext of such deals is, &quot;I have so little confidence in your ability to cope with this normal response to separation that I believe the only solution is for me to rescue you.&quot; Such expressions of anxiety and doubt contradict the recommended expressions of optimism and confidence outlined in the prevention strategies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53354 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Such deals plant the seeds of homesickness by giving young people the expectation that they will not like the new place. Negative separation attitudes are powerful predictors of homesickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Such deals prevent the development of effective coping by pointing young people toward an escape route.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Such deals paralyze surrogate caregivers who, after enthusiastic support and coaching, may be faced with a child who says, &quot;My parents said that if I didn't like it here, they would come to get me.&quot; Parents are then faced with two equally unsatisfactory choices:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fulfill their promise, pick the child up, and deprive him or her of a wonderful opportunity to grow and develop</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renege on their promise and suffer an erosion of trust in their relationship with the child</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital stays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research examining the association between contact with home and adjustment in hospitalized children is scarce. A review of these studies suggests that the quality, rather than the quantity, of child-caregiver contact is associated with adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Because the goal of hospitalization is good health, rather than increased self-reliance, a different approach to child-caregiver contact is warranted than for children at camp. Whereas minimal contact is encouraged during a stay at camp, maximal contact (both in-person and electronic) is appropriate for children hospitalized with medical problems. During psychiatric hospitalizations, staff can advise parents on the appropriate quality and quantity of child-caregiver contact. Indeed, this contact may be an integral part of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resources for families are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77248\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77248 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homesickness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homesickness is defined as the distress and functional impairment caused by an actual or anticipated separation from home. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for homesickness include lack of experience with separation or the new environment, negative attitudes toward the separation or the environment, insecure attachment to the primary caregiver, and little or no involvement in the decision-making process. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with homesickness present with withdrawn or depressed behaviors. However, some present with somatic complaints or externalizing behaviors (eg, anger, irritability, fighting, swearing, or destroying property). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Moderate/severe</span> homesickness typically does not improve spontaneously but can be largely prevented. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of homesickness is made by asking the question, &quot;How homesick have you been feeling?&quot; (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary care clinicians and parents can work together to prevent homesickness during planned separations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53354 \">table 1</a>) or hospitalizations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77922 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'General guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective coping strategies include distraction, social connection, remote contact with home (eg, writing a letter, looking at a photograph), social support, optimism, perspective, cognitive avoidance, and vicarious social support. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Coping strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping strategies that are ineffective include relinquished control, fantasy, delinquent behavior, and escape. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Coping strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The kind and frequency of child-caregiver contact during separation depends upon the goals of the separation. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Contact with home'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We strongly discourage parents from making &quot;pick-up deals&quot; with their children during planned, recreational separations.
