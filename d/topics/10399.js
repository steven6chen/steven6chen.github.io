Childhood nosebleeds are rarely severe and seldom require hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nonetheless, frequent minor nosebleeds can be both bothersome and alarming for parents and children. Most epistaxis in children is minor and is easily managed with direct compression of the nasal alae for 5 to 10 minutes. For more significant or recurrent epistaxis other techniques might include vasoconstrictor nose drops, cautery with 75 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a>, topical sealants or glue, nasal packing, or balloon catheters. Children with refractory epistaxis or underlying local or systemic factors (eg, nasal tumor or bleeding disorder) that predispose to epistaxis require an individualized approach to management and specialty consultation.</p><p>The management of epistaxis in children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, etiology, and evaluation of epistaxis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with epistaxis have spontaneous anterior nasal bleeding without airway compromise or hemodynamic instability. Rapid assessment of general appearance, vital signs, airway stability, and mental status are still necessary to identify children who require airway intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Airway intervention may be needed for patients who are spitting or regurgitating blood and in those with hemorrhagic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with marked nasal hemorrhage, rapid assessment and stabilization is followed immediately by attempts to identify the source of bleeding and initiation of measures to control it, usually in consultation with otolaryngology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Blood factors or platelets should be administered to patients who have bleeding disorders that can be treated with such products. The remainder of the evaluation is undertaken after the patient is stabilized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR CONSULTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most episodes of epistaxis resolve with compression of the nasal alae for 5 to 10 minutes and do not require specialty care. Referral to or consultation with an otolaryngologist or other specialist is indicated for patients with severe epistaxis, troublesome recurrent epistaxis, or local abnormalities, such as tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76702\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76702 \">image 1</a>), polyps, or telangiectasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, consultation with an otolaryngologist may be helpful in children who require nasal packing. The otolaryngologist can place the pack and help to determine the underlying cause of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Emergency treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Nasal packing'</a> below.)</p><p>Referral to hematology may be warranted for patients with severe or recurrent bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family history of bleeding disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient is stabilized, management of epistaxis in children entails control of acute hemorrhage and prevention of recurrences by controlling underlying local or systemic disease processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Active bleeding usually responds to simple compression, but may require cautery, application of a hemostatic agent, nasal packing, or more aggressive measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active bleeding usually responds to simple compression, which involves compressing the nasal alae together to apply pressure to the Kiesselbach plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50603\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50603 \">picture 1</a>). Pressure should be applied for a minimum of five minutes before checking to see if the bleeding is controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If the patient is too young to reliably pinch his or her nose closed the parents or clinical personnel can perform the compression maneuver. Young children typically do best with parental compression. During simple compression the child should be sitting up and bent forward at the waist to minimize bleeding into the oral cavity and hypopharynx. This position avoids possible aspiration or swallowing of the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Efforts to calm the child (eg, distraction, reassuring statements, and positive imagery) and reduce crying are complementary to direct compression. Control of bleeding is usually achieved within 5 to 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>If direct compression does not readily stop epistaxis, topical vasoconstriction may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenylephrine</a> has been associated with significant morbidity and even mortality when used topically in children in the operative setting, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetazoline</a> (eg, one to two squirts into the bleeding side of the nose with 0.05 percent oxymetazoline hydrochloride) although the amount of either vasoconstrictor is less in the emergency setting than in operative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetazoline</a> is not available, the minimum dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenylephrine</a> needed to obtain vasoconstriction is recommended, and in children weighing up to 25 kg, the initial dose should not exceed 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The lowest concentration of phenylephrine should be used for small children (eg, phenylephrine 0.25 percent diluted with an equal volume of sterile saline to 0.125 percent; phenylephrine 0.25 percent contains 2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> phenylephrine 0.125 percent contains 1250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span>. The dose for small children should be carefully measured in a 1 or 0.5 mL oral type dosing syringe labeled for topical use only.</p><p>The vasoconstrictor can be applied using a squirt bottle or a small piece of <span class=\"nowrap\">cotton/gauze</span> pledget gently placed in the nose adjacent to the septum. After the vasoconstrictor is placed, direct pressure is applied at the sides of the nose for five minutes, after which any pledgets can be removed for reinspection of the bleeding site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cautery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anterior septal bleed unresponsive to the above measures may benefit from cautery, either chemically or electrically (thermally) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Cauterization is also commonly used for children with recurrent benign epistaxis who are seen in the otolaryngology clinic. The procedure is well tolerated by most children in spite of minor pain, even though topical anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> is routinely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For cauterization to be successful, the patient must be cooperative or sedated. Chemical cautery is usually accomplished with 75 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a> sticks. The applicator tip is applied to a small area surrounding the bleeding site with care to avoid intact skin, starting proximally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61123 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72922 \">picture 3</a>). The agent will work only on a relatively dry surface; the bleeding point itself cannot be cauterized until hemostasis is achieved either through cautery of the adjacent area, vasoconstrictive agents, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct pressure. Electrical cautery works equally well, but again the surface needs to be relatively dry. Both types of cautery may cause rhinorrhea and crusting. Overzealous and simultaneous bilateral cautery of the septum should be avoided because septal ulceration and perforation may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. Some clinicians choose to use a nasal speculum to guide cautery, although it is not typically required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Matrix sealant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A matrix hemostatic sealant composed of collagen-derived particles and topical bovine-derived thrombin, has been used to control acute epistaxis (eg, Floseal, Surgiflo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The matrix sealant is applied via a syringe and is hydrophilic, so it conforms well to irregular bleeding surfaces. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrin glue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The application of fibrin glue is another method of treatment of epistaxis unresponsive to local pressure. Fibrin glue provides rapid hemostasis without nasal packing and is relatively painless compared to cauterization or nasal packing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This technique is particularly useful for patients with coagulopathy or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Fibrin glue is used less commonly now that matrix sealants are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia-osler-weber-rendu-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal packing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the bleeding is severe or if local compression and vasoconstriction are unsuccessful, the next step in management is nasal packing to tamponade local bleeding. If nasal packing is required, otolaryngology consultation is usually warranted. The otolaryngologist can place the pack and help determine the underlying cause of the bleeding. In addition, hospital admission may be required, since the need for nasal packing is suggestive of an underlying disorder that may require further attention. Nasal packing should be avoided in infants younger than one year of age because of the risk of aspiration. However, serious epistaxis warranting nasal packing in this age group is rare. </p><p>Nasal packing is rarely needed for children, but if it is, rapid placement is critical to its success. Nasal packing may be preceded by the application of topical anesthesia (eg, 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> mixed 50:50 with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetazoline</a>, 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, if the bleeding is brisk, this may not be possible. Nasal packing is most easily accomplished with a pediatric nasal sponge (eg, Merocel, Rhinocell) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51907\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51907 \">picture 4</a>). The pack is inserted directly along the floor of the nasal cavity and is expanded with 10 to 20 mL of saline. The open-cell polymer pack will need to be removed in one to five days.</p><p>Alternative absorbable nasal packs are made of gelatin (Gelfoam), which liquefies in the nose in two to five days; oxidized, regenerated cellulose (Surgicel), which dissolves in approximately seven days; or microfibrillar collagen (Avitene).</p><p>These absorbable agents are preferred in patients in whom minimal pressure is needed for bleeding control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], or in whom standard nasal packing might promote more bleeding by destroying the nasal mucosa (eg, patients with bleeding disorders and immune deficiencies, and those requiring renal dialysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A less technology-intensive but more technique-dependent approach to nasal packing is to use Vaseline or Xeroform gauze dispensed in 72-inch lengths. The procedure is performed by laying the gauze in an accordion fashion throughout the nasal cavity. Gauze packing provides a tight pack, but requires removal, is uncomfortable, and may create additional mucosal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, it is an acceptable method but the alternatives above are preferred, if available. </p><p>Nonabsorbable packs are typically left in place for one to five days and then removed by the otolaryngologist. The practitioner and patient should be prepared for possible additional bleeding at the time of pack removal. While the pack is in place, and even after its removal, there is a small risk of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. Neither prophylactic systemic antibiotics nor impregnation of nasal packing with antibiotic ointment eradicate nasal carriage or reliably prevent toxic shock syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Thus, antibiotics are not routinely recommended. However, antibiotics may be prescribed if there is evidence of an underlying sinus infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83454 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-microbiology-and-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children: Microbiology and treatment&quot;, section on 'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>After anterior nasal packing is placed, the oropharynx must be examined to confirm adequate hemostasis. Posterior bleeding may be present if patients report swallowing blood after anterior nasal packing has been placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Evaluation for posterior bleeding requires consultation with an otolaryngologist, and possibly placement of posterior nasal packing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the extremely rare case where bleeding cannot be controlled by one of the methods described above, more aggressive therapeutic procedures may be necessary as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal balloon catheters</strong> &ndash; Placement of nasal balloon catheters is relatively straight forward and can be accomplished emergently by any trained clinician. A single or double balloon catheter (eg, a Foley catheter, Rapid Rhino, Epistat, Epi-Max, Post-stat, or Post-stop) can be inserted. The technique for insertion is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-epistaxis#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with epistaxis&quot;, section on 'Balloon catheters'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-epistaxis#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with epistaxis&quot;, section on 'Foley catheter'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Embolization of the internal maxillary artery</strong> &ndash; Embolization of the internal maxillary artery has been reported to be successful in cases of intractable epistaxis unresponsive to other treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. An otolaryngologist with pediatric expertise should guide the decision to perform embolization versus operative control. <br/><br/>Embolization also has been useful in controlling bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, juvenile angiofibromas, hemangiomas, arterial-venous malformations, and traumatic arterial lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In general, morbidity is low when embolization is performed by an experienced interventional radiologist. However, most studies report a small incidence of major complications, usually stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Operative control</strong> &ndash; Surgery (transnasal endoscopy and direct cautery or arterial ligation) is necessary in some cases, particularly those in which the bleeding is of posterior or superior origin and should be performed by an otolaryngologist with pediatric expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with refractory or prolonged (&gt;30 minutes) epistaxis, the cause and source of the bleeding must be reconsidered.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Direct compression'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent benign epistaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>Application of pressure to the Kiesselbach plexus is crucial, since this site is the source of most nosebleeds in children. Some patients and parents believe that they should compress the nasal bones between the eyes, but compression between the eyes does not affect the source of bleeding. Some families also believe that ice should be applied to the neck, forehead, or nasal bones, but at this time there is no evidence that this helps (on the other hand, it probably does not hurt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Families may also try to induce vasoconstriction with over-the-counter decongestants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetazoline</a>), but the family should be warned that oxymetazoline should be used sparingly and for a maximum of three days to avoid rebound hyperemia with recurrent epistaxis.</p><p>If simple compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasoconstriction are not successful in controlling bleeding, then further measures must be taken, usually in an emergency department setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF RECURRENT BENIGN EPISTAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, recurrent episodes of benign epistaxis are more common than epistaxis that cannot be controlled. Recurrence of epistaxis can be prevented only if the many causes are considered and appropriate preventive measures are instituted. To ensure that recurrent epistaxis is benign, children with recurrent epistaxis should be examined closely for a foreign body or nasal mass; bleeding disorders should be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting and the suggested laboratory evaluation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest humidification of the nasal mucosa and prevention of local trauma as first-line therapies for prevention of recurrent benign epistaxis in children. Running a warm or cold humidifier containing water without additives in the child's bedroom during the night can be helpful, but may be contraindicated in the child with severe allergies or pulmonary problems. Alternatively, saline nose spray, commonly available over-the-counter in most drug stores, can be applied to the nose two to four times a day. If the child is using a nasal corticosteroid spray, it should be discontinued. In addition, prevention of local trauma by discouraging nose picking, keeping fingernails closely trimmed, and use of protective face-gear, as indicated, during sports participation is appropriate for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p>Additional measures vary, depending upon the suspected underlying cause of epistaxis, and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cautery</strong> &ndash; Cauterization of the septum with 75 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a>, as described above, may be a temporizing measure if prominent vessels are seen in the Kiesselbach plexus. We avoid the use of 95 percent silver nitrate for cautery. In one trial of 101 children that compared 75 versus 95 percent silver nitrate, application of 75 percent silver nitrate was clinically significantly more effective at two weeks than 95 percent silver nitrate (88 versus 65 percent complete resolution of bleeding, respectively) and was also significantly less painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Chemical cautery with silver nitrate can typically be performed in an <span class=\"nowrap\">office/ambulatory</span> setting. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, children who are unable to cooperate may require general anesthesia for a cautery procedure. If the procedure is done in the operating room monopolar or bipolar cautery may be used. In one study of 110 children, bipolar cautery was found to have a longer nosebleed-free period within two years of treatment compared to chemical cautery, although there was no difference between the two cautery methods two years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cautery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical therapy</strong> &ndash; Various topical treatments (eg, chlorhexidine-neomycin cream or triple antibiotic ointment) have been advocated to reduce chronic inflammation caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> which may play a role in recurrent epistaxis. These agents may be applied to the mucosa of the nasal septum, potentially decreasing the propensity to bleed. Application is typically recommended one to two times per day. Care must be taken that the applicator (often a cotton swab) does not traumatize the mucosa of the nose. However, the indications and duration of this therapy are unclear and long-term benefit has <strong>not</strong> been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].<br/><br/>Petroleum jelly application to the nose is often recommended, but has no benefit over simple observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with allergic rhinitis</strong> &ndash; In patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal corticosteroids should be discontinued. However, because allergic rhinitis can contribute to epistaxis independent of topical corticosteroid therapy, alternative therapy should be provided (eg, oral antihistamines). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with upper respiratory tract infection</strong> &ndash; Recurrent epistaxis during an acute upper respiratory tract infection or an exacerbation of allergic rhinitis occasionally may be prevented by using anti-histamine decongestant preparations in patients older than two years of age, although care must be taken to avoid excessive drying of the nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>The best treatment for recurrent epistaxis in children is not known. Limited evidence suggests that cautery with topical therapy or topical therapy alone may be helpful in the short-term but may not provide improved long-term resolution of recurrent epistaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of five small trials evaluated the short term effectiveness of various interventions for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in 468 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Interventions included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a> cautery, application of antiseptic cream containing 0.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">neomycin</a> and 0.1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> (eg, Naseptin), and application of petroleum jelly.
