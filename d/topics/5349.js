Widespread promotion of low fat diets in the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in the percentage of calories from fat in the United States diet and a concurrent increase in carbohydrate intake. Despite these dietary changes, the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus continued to rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Perhaps partly due to unsatisfactory outcomes with low fat diets, a large segment of the population that wants to lose weight is increasingly following many popular diets that emphasize low or no carbohydrates for weight loss.</p><p>In the scientific community, serious concern has also been raised over dietary recommendations for high carbohydrate, low fat diets. High carbohydrate diets reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and raise blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, and triglyceride and blood pressure, contributing to a now well-recognized metabolic profile called insulin resistance syndrome that is conducive for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the differences in chemical structure, physical form, fiber content, and the degree of processing (refining and gelatinization), different forms of carbohydrates are likely to have heterogeneous biological functions and health effects. These effects are discussed here. Overall recommendations for a healthy diet and dietary therapy for obesity are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H4190314114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Choice of diet'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF CARBOHYDRATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbohydrates are traditionally classified as simple (sugars, ie, mono- and disaccharides) or complex (starches, ie, polysaccharides) on the basis of the number of sugar molecules in their chemical structures. It had been assumed that complex carbohydrates cause smaller rises in blood glucose than simple carbohydrates. Dietary guidelines for individuals with diabetes mellitus that recommend the use of complex rather than simple carbohydrates to control blood glucose levels reflect this assumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>A growing body of data, however, contradicts this notion. In the mid-1970s, the first series of studies were published in the English literature showing that various starchy foods differ in their ability to induce plasma glucose and insulin responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. These findings initiated a new era of research on the in vivo physiologic effects of carbohydrates. Collectively, these data demonstrate that digestion of carbohydrates, particularly starch, is not a rate-limiting event and is often quite rapid because of the presence of sufficient amylolytic capacity in the intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, postprandial glycemic responses to potato and white bread are similar to the response to pure glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], indicating that complex carbohydrates may not differ from simple sugars in their effect on plasma glucose level.</p><p>Thus, carbohydrates can be classified by their glycemic index (GI), indicating their effect on blood glucose. In addition, carbohydrates can be characterized by their fiber content, which refers to undigested carbohydrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The fiber content also reflects the content of minerals, vitamins, and other biologically active constituents. Finally, dissolving carbohydrate in water, typically as sugar-sweetened beverages, has important effects on satiety. Thus, whether carbohydrates are consumed in solid or liquid form needs to be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC INDEX</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glycemic index (GI) is an in vivo measure of the relative impact of carbohydrate-containing foods on blood glucose. A particular food's GI is determined by evaluating the incremental rises of blood glucose after ingestion of a food that contains 50 g of available carbohydrate compared with the same amount of carbohydrate from a reference food, usually white bread or glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The following values are generally applied for defining the GI of a particular food (using glucose as a reference):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low GI &ndash; 55 or less</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medium GI &ndash; 56 to 69</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High GI &ndash; 70 or more</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The GI of a food depends upon the rapidity of digestion and absorption of its dietary carbohydrates, which is largely determined by both its physical and chemical properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Typically, foods with a low degree of starch gelatinization, such as pasta, and those containing a high level of viscous soluble fiber, such as whole-grain barley, oats, and rye, have slower rates of digestion and lower GI values.</p><p>Another important influence on GI values is the ratio of amylose (a linear-chain molecule of 300 to 600 glucose residues linked by alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds) to amylopectin (a larger, highly branched polymer of 6000 glucose residues linked by both alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds). Foods with a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">amylose/amylopectin</span> ratio, such as legumes and parboiled rice, tend to have lower GI values, likely due to the compact structure of amylose, which physically slows enzymatic reactions. In contrast, the branched structure of amylopectin is open to enzymatic attack and is thus easily digested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Utility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of the GI has shown that many complex carbohydrates induce glycemic and insulinemic responses nearly as high as those induced by pure glucose, thereby further casting doubt on the usefulness of the simple versus complex classification system. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification of carbohydrates'</a> above.)</p><p>The pros and cons of the GI concept have been debated since its introduction in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The debate originated from evaluating what kind of dietary carbohydrate is best for controlling postprandial glycemia in the medical nutritional therapy of diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Concerns raised about the clinical usefulness of the GI revolve around two major issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/2,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usefulness of the GI for mixed meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of long-term studies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mixed meals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the early 1980s, three studies showed that when individual carbohydrate foods were taken as part of a mixed meal, differences in glycemic responses between foods no longer existed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The authors postulated that these findings were due to the effects of fat and protein on glycemic responses. Although the methodology of these studies has been criticized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], the results were used by the 1986 National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference on diet and exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus to reject the use of the GI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Since then, many studies aimed at addressing these concerns have been conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], and there are now abundant data to support the GI concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In particular, several studies have shown that although fat and protein affect the absolute glycemic response, they do not affect the relative differences between foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In other words, given the same amount of protein and fat in a meal, high glycemic foods still lead to a higher glycemic response than do low glycemic foods. Studies using standardized methodology have indicated that the correlation between the GI of mixed meals and the average GI values of individual component foods ranges from 0.84 to 0.99 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/14,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy regarding the clinical usefulness of the GI continues, mainly due to the lack of long-term data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29</a>]. Most metabolic studies of GI are of very short duration, on the order of several meals or several days. This has become a contentious point, with editorials and commentaries calling for long-term studies to assess the clinical usefulness of the GI. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic index/glycemic load'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC LOAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A principal argument against the glycemic index (GI) concept is that it cannot capture the entire glucose-raising potential of dietary carbohydrates, because the blood glucose response is influenced by the quantity of carbohydrate consumed as well as the quality (the latter reflected in the GI). To address this concern, the concept of glycemic load (GL) was introduced. Defined as the product of the GI value of a food and its carbohydrate content, GL incorporates both the quality and quantity of carbohydrate consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>With white bread used as the reference standard, dietary GL quantifies the glucose-raising potential of dietary carbohydrates, with each unit of dietary GL representing the equivalent glycemic effect of 1 g of carbohydrate from white bread. In general, carbohydrate-rich foods with low fiber content have high GI and GL values; examples include potatoes, refined cereal products, and many sugar-sweetened beverages. In contrast, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables with high fiber content provide low to very low GLs per serving.</p><p>Many low GI foods are not necessarily high in fiber (eg, pasta, basmati rice, and dairy products), while some high fiber, whole-meal bread and cereal products (eg, Raisin Bran and Wheaties) are high in GI. This highlights the importance of determining GI values of food products through direct testing. Such testing has distinguished two types of available glucose from foods (most foods contain a mixture of starch and sugars), termed rapidly available glucose (RAG) and slowly available glucose (SAG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In two studies that examined a total of 64 food products, the RAG values were significantly correlated with both their direct glycemic response and published GI values, supporting the physiologic relevance of this in vitro categorization of RAG and SAG in foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The following values are generally applied for defining the GL of a particular food (per serving, using glucose as a reference):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low GL &ndash; 10 or less</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medium GL &ndash; 11 to 19</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High GL &ndash; 20 or more</p><p/><p>The following values are generally applied for defining the GL per day:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low GL &ndash; Less than 80</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High GL &ndash; More than 120</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES AND WEIGHT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Grains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relatively few studies have directly examined the effects of specific types of carbohydrate-rich foods on weight changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Due to their high fiber and water content, whole grain foods contain fewer calories gram for gram than the isovolumic amount of the corresponding refined grain foods. Whole grains may protect against weight gain through several mechanisms that involve effects on satiety, postload glucose and insulin responses, and antioxidant properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Several large, prospective studies have found that intake of whole grains, as opposed to refined grains, is inversely associated with body weight and fat distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), intake of whole grains was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI) at all levels of fat intake and predicted insulin levels, 10-year weight gain, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors including blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Participants in the highest category of whole grain intake (&gt;21 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/2000</span> kcal) gained approximately 3.6 kg (8 lb) less in weight than those in the lowest category of intake (&lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/2000</span> kcal).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) of middle-aged women, participants with the greatest increase in intake of whole grain gained an average of 1.52 kg less than those with the smallest increase in intake, independent of body weight at baseline, age, and changes in covariate status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Women in the highest quintile of whole grain intake had a 49 percent lower risk of major weight gain than women in the highest quintile of refined grain intake (odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.67).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective investigation of dietary patterns among 120,877 men and women apparently free of chronic diseases reported that increasing whole grain intake by one <span class=\"nowrap\">serving/day</span> was associated with a modest 0.37 pound lower weight gain over a four-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies corroborated these findings, where greater whole grains intake was associated with less weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic index/glycemic load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manipulation of dietary glycemic index (GI) or glycemic load (GL) has emerged as an important approach to weight control. Short-term feeding trials have shown that carbohydrate absorption after a meal is inversely proportional to satiety and directly related to increased caloric intake. Since the duration of postmeal satiety is generally related to postprandial glycemia, low GI foods have been hypothesized to reduce hunger signals and delay the onset of the next meal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Low-carbohydrate diets'</a>.)</p><p>This concept was examined in a randomized trial that compared the hormonal and metabolic changes associated with isocaloric meals differing only in GI and GL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Blood glucose and fatty acid concentrations were significantly lower, while counterregulatory hormones were elevated in high GI diets three to five hours after ingestion.</p><p>Similarly, a randomized trial compared the effects of a low GL diet (total daily GL 82) and a low fat diet (total daily GL 205) on resting energy expenditure (REE) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in 39 young adults during a diet designed to provide 60 percent of energy requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. After subjects had lost 10 percent of their baseline body weight, REE had decreased less in those on a low GL diet (-96 versus -176 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day),</span> and hunger was also less on the low GL diet. The diets had similar effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but those on the low GL diet had greater decreases in triglycerides (-3.5 versus +16.2 percent), C-reactive protein (-47.7 versus -5.1 percent), and on a measure of insulin resistance (-33.9 versus -15.8 percent). There was also a trend toward a larger decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure on the low GL diet. These results suggest that a low GL diet can reduce some of the physiologic adaptations to a low calorie diet (decreased REE, hunger) that interfere with sustained weight loss, while achieving an improved CHD-risk profile.</p><p>Other trials also suggest weight loss and CHD-risk benefits with low GI diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. In a meta-analysis of six trials (202 participants) comparing a low GI diet with a higher GI diet or a conventional, calorie-restricted, reduced fat diet, short-term weight loss (weighted mean difference 1.1 kg) and reduction in LDL cholesterol (-0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> were significantly greater in the low GI diet group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There were no trials lasting more than six months, and therefore, the long-term benefits of a low GI diet are unknown.</p><p>Baseline insulin secretion may predict weight loss with low GL diets. This was illustrated in a randomized trial of obese young adults assigned to a low GL or low fat diet after baseline assessment of insulin secretion (serum insulin concentration measured 30 minutes after a 75 g oral glucose load) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. At 18 months of follow-up, patients with higher insulin concentrations lost more weight and body fat with the low GL diet than with the low fat diet. In contrast, in patients with lower insulin secretion, both diets produced similar results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Very low carbohydrate diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;very low carbohydrate diet,&quot; among different practitioners, refers to diets that contain anywhere from 0 to &lt;60 grams of carbohydrates, or approximately 0 to 10 percent of dietary energy derived from carbohydrate.</p><p>The impact of very low carbohydrate diets on weight loss has been examined in several randomized trials. Studies have varied in type of population, design, and intensity of intervention. These trials are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Low-carbohydrate diets'</a>.)</p><p>In brief, the findings from the trials show that very low carbohydrate diets are safe with regard to serum lipids and are more effective for short-term weight loss than low fat diets. However, the impact of macronutrient composition on long-term weight loss remains a contentious area. This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy#H4190314114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;, section on 'Choice of diet'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES AND DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In two meta-analyses of 37 observational studies of glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) and risk of chronic disease, significant positive associations were found for type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease (CHD), gallbladder disease, and breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. However, there are no direct clinical trial data to show whether manipulation of dietary GI or GL will prevent or delay the development of CHD in nondiabetic or diabetic populations. Randomized trials with patient important outcomes (cardiovascular events, diabetes incidence) are needed to determine the impact of manipulation of dietary GI or GL on development of chronic disease.</p><p>The associations and potential mechanisms by which carbohydrates contribute to the risk of developing these chronic diseases are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes and metabolic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In two meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, a high GI or high GL diet was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. In one of these analyses, there was a significant dose-response relationship between dietary GL and the risk of type 2 diabetes, in which dietary GL appeared to be associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes when intake levels were higher than 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/2000</span> kcal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The dose-dependent relationship was stronger in women than in men and in European Americans than in other ethnic groups. The relationship between dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Dietary patterns'</a>.)</p><p>Resistance to insulin-mediated glucose transport is a fundamental early defect in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). Among individuals with impaired insulin action, glucose homeostasis can be maintained through increased insulin production. In some individuals, hyperglycemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compensatory hyperinsulinemia (increased insulin production) make the pancreatic beta cells eventually lose their responsiveness to glucose, ultimately leading to the development of clinical diabetes.</p><p>While mechanisms for the so-called insulin resistance-pancreatic exhaustion phenomenon are not fully understood, it has been clearly established (at least in animal models) that glucose toxicity contributes to insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Regardless of the ultimate dietary source of glucose, however, animal models show that postprandial hyperglycemia contributes to insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Among individuals with diabetes, a chronic increment in the plasma glucose concentration causes defects in insulin secretion and may lead to insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, dietary factors that increase plasma glucose and insulin responses may aggravate the effects of insulin resistance that, in turn, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Conversely, dietary factors that minimize both glycemic and insulinemic responses may protect against the development of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Animal studies have demonstrated adverse effects of diets very high in fructose or sucrose on insulin sensitivity and hypertriglyceridemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Similarly, a study in which partially pancreatectomized rats were given diets with identical nutrients except for the type of starch (either high or low GI) found that rats given the high GI food had almost twice the body fat of the rats given low GI food after nine weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, the high GI group had greater increases over time in blood glucose and plasma insulin after oral glucose and higher plasma triglyceride concentrations.</p><p>Because of limited data in humans, however, controversies remain regarding the role of sugars in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/1,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,57</a>]. Similarly, few studies have examined the relation between starch types and insulin resistance in humans. Partly because of the difficulties involved in assessing whole-body insulin sensitivity, studies of dietary GI in humans have focused primarily on markers of insulin resistance, including levels of postprandial glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and fasting triglycerides. Most studies show reduced glycemic and insulin responses to a low GI meal as compared with a high GI meal.

To some extent, the public health campaign to lower fat in the United States has been translated by food manufacturers and consumers into a potentially harmful set of food choices. Instead of replacing high fat foods with fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grain foods, consumers have often increased their consumption of low fat or &quot;fat-free&quot; varieties of naturally high fat foods, such as fat-free snack foods. The result is often an increase in high glycemic load (GL) refined carbohydrates and sugar.</p><p>The prevailing dietary pattern of the United States in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century mainly consists of white bread, white rice, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sugar-laden snacks. The United States food supply has become reliant on highly refined carbohydrates as significant sources of energy since these carbohydrate-dense foods are economical and easily consumed in fast-food restaurants or otherwise highly processed and prepackaged. The quality of these carbohydrates is considerably different from those consumed before the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century since the refining process has changed their compositions. As an example, processing whole grains into white flour actually increases the caloric density by 10 percent, reduces the amount of dietary fiber by 80 percent, and reduces the amount of dietary protein by almost 30 percent, leaving a dietary substance that is nearly pure starchy carbohydrate with far fewer nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-carbohydrates/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The table lists the glycemic indices (GIs) for some major carbohydrate-contributing foods consumed by participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the GL values per serving, and their percent contribution to overall dietary GL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71978 \">table 1</a>).

It is now well established that even when foods contain the same amount of carbohydrate, there are clinically significant differences in glycemic effects. These differences led to the development of the concepts of glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL). Although not all studies are in complete agreement and further research is clearly needed, the preponderance of the evidence supports the clinical utility of these nutritional concepts.
