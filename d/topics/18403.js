Esophageal cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and stents can be useful for symptom palliation in patients with locally unresectable or advanced metastatic esophageal cancer, those with poor functional status who cannot tolerate surgery or chemoradiotherapy, or for those with locally recurrent disease after primary treatment. These patients generally have weight loss and dysphagia due to esophageal obstruction. Furthermore, cough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aspiration may be the result of a tracheoesophageal fistula, either as a complication of the tumor or its treatment.</p><p>Although less effective than when used for the treatment of distal esophageal obstruction, expandable metal stents can be placed successfully in patients with proximal or cervical esophageal malignant strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Smaller diameter stents (tracheobronchial, biliary) may be better tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Esophageal stents may provide palliation of dysphagia caused by extraesophageal malignancies that compress the esophagus extrinsically. However, symptom improvement is significantly less in this setting than in patients with intrinsic esophageal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, self-expandable stents are being used to treat benign esophageal disorders such as esophageal leaks, fistulas, and refractory strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Additionally, esophageal stents are being increasingly used to treat benign esophageal diseases. Since nearly all stents are only approved for treatment of malignant disease, their use for benign disease is off-label.</p><p>This topic will review the use of expandable stents in the treatment of esophageal obstruction from esophageal cancer and extrinsic esophageal compression from extraesophageal malignancies. A general overview of several methods of endoscopic palliation for esophageal cancer and the use of expandable stents in other portions of the gastrointestinal tract are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-palliation-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral stents for the palliation of malignant gastroduodenal obstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral stents for the management of malignant colorectal obstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF STENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three types of expandable stents: metal, plastic, and biodegradable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130516\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-expandable metal stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) are composed of a variety of metal alloys with varying shapes and sizes depending upon the individual manufacturer and the organ in which they are to be placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53919 \">picture 1</a>). Many of the stents are composed of nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium. Several SEMS are available, while new devices and refinements to existing stents continue to emerge. There are three varieties of metal stents: uncovered, partially covered, and fully covered. </p><p>The advantage of covered stents is that they resist tumor ingrowth, but they have a higher migration rate, especially when fully covered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. They can also be used in the closure of fistulas and leaks. Partially covered stents are uncovered at their ends, which allows the stent to embed in the tissue and helps to prevent migration. Fully covered stents offer the advantage of potentially being removable, but are associated with an increased risk of migration. Uncovered stents are less likely to migrate, but are subject to tumor ingrowth and resultant obstruction.</p><p>In addition, some stents have an antireflux valve to try to prevent esophageal reflux in patients with stents placed across the esophagogastric junction. </p><p>Older stents were not small enough to pass through the endoscope in their pre-deployed forms. There is a newer SEMS (Niti-S through the scope esophageal stent) that passes through the channel of a therapeutic endoscope (working channel 3.7 mm). The advantage of this stent is the direct delivery under endoscopic visualization, but the downside is that a large outer diameter endoscope is required. This can make complete endoscopic assessment of the stricture difficult without first performing a dilation, especially compared with small outer diameter endoscopes (4.9 to 5.4 mm).</p><p>Stents vary in length from 6 to 19.5 cm (though the longest stents available in the United States are 15 cm) and in shaft diameter from 10 to 23 mm. Devices available in the United States include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wallflex &ndash; partially and fully covered nitinol stents without an antireflux valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evolution &ndash; partially covered and fully covered nitinol stents without an antireflux valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultraflex stent &ndash; partially covered and uncovered nitinol stents without an antireflux valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alimaxx-ES, Endomaxx, and Endomaxx EVT stents &ndash; fully covered nitinol stents with (Endomaxx EVT only) and without an antireflux valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Niti-S &ndash; fully covered nitinol stent without an antireflux valve; this stent comes in two versions, the covered Niti-S and the double-layered Niti-S that has an additional layer of nitinol</p><p/><p>Several stents from a variety of manufactures are available outside of the United States; it is important to realize that although SEMS are not approved for benign disease, fully covered SEMS with a covering or lining have been consistently demonstrated to be removable. When used for benign disease, they have a high-rate of migration, which can be reduced with the use of endoscopic suturing or the use of newer over the scope-clipping devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-expandable plastic stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stents mentioned above are made from a metal alloy. A self-expandable plastic stent is available and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for benign disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>] called the Polyflex. The Polyflex stent is made from polyester and is fully covered with silicone. It does not have an antireflux valve.</p><p>There are several studies on the use of the PolyFlex stent for benign disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A randomized trial of 101 patients with unresectable esophageal cancer found no difference in palliation compared with a partially covered Ultraflex (metal) stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, there were significantly more adverse events with the Polyflex stents, particularly stent migration. Similar conclusions were reached in another randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>There are several studies showing that the stent can be used as a bridge to surgery for esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. One study included 32 patients with dysphagia and weight loss who were candidates for neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The majority of patients had esophageal adenocarcinoma in the distal one-third of the esophagus or at the esophagogastric junction. Initial stent placement was successful in all patients. Stent migrations were noted radiographically in eight patients, but only two required stent replacement. Mean dysphagia scores improved significantly following stent placement from 2.1 to 0.6. Twenty patients subsequently underwent esophagogastrectomy; five had their stents removed prior to surgery or after induction anesthesia, while the remaining 15 stents were removed with the resected specimen. No surgical complications were attributed to stent placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168184935\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-expandable biodegradable stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A self-expandable biodegradable stent has been developed and is available outside the United States. The SX-ELLA Esophageal Degradable BD stent is made from a woven surgical suture material, polydioxanone. It is uncovered and does not have an antireflux valve. The stent fully degrades in approximately three months. The stent has been used for malignant strictures to relieve dysphagia during neoadjuvant therapy and as a treatment for benign refractory strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) can be placed under endoscopic guidance with or without the aid of fluoroscopy. The manufacturers recommend initial stricture dilation to a minimal luminal diameter usually of 6 to 10 mm to allow passage of the pre-deployed stent.</p><p>The length of the stenosis must be accurately measured and a stent chosen that is at least 4 cm longer than the neoplasm or stricture. For proximal esophageal lesions, expandable stent placement can be technically difficult, although these stents have been placed successfully in patients with cervical esophageal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Placement can be accomplished endoscopically by visualization and documentation of distances measured from the incisors to the proximal margin of the tumor, followed by stent placement under endoscopic visualization. For patients with malignant esophageal strictures near the upper esophageal sphincter, the position of the stent during deployment is adjusted so that the upper end of the stent is just within the sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Frequently, concomitant fluoroscopy is used with or without internal or external markers placed at the margins of the stricture. Metal clips used for endoscopic hemostasis have also been used to mark the proximal and distal margins of the tumor prior to stent deployment. Stent placement then proceeds under fluoroscopic guidance. </p><p>Patients with large, bulky mid and proximal esophageal tumors and mediastinal tumors should be evaluated for possible tracheal compression. Imaging studies such as CT scans should be reviewed to determine if there is tracheal compression. Such patients may benefit from airway stent placement prior to esophageal stent placement. During the placement of stents, the endoscopist should be prepared for the possibility of tracheal compression and the need for endotracheal intubation and emergent stent removal if stridor develops. Balloon dilation prior to stent deployment at the level of the stricture may provide clues to airway compromise. </p><p>Once a SEMS is deployed, it expands against the stenosis and the surrounding tissue. This anchors the stent and helps prevent stent migration. In addition, methods to anchor the stent in place using endoscopic suturing systems or over-the-scope clip devices have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. For stent placement in the very distal esophagus, it is important not to leave an excessive length of stent within the stomach because the stent may contact the opposite gastric wall, leading to obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to ulceration.</p><p>Following stent placement, patients should be advised to avoid dense and fibrous foods such as broccoli and large pieces of meat, and to consume a <span class=\"nowrap\">liquid/soft</span> mechanical diet to avoid food impaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, if an open stent (non-antireflux) is placed across the esophagogastric junction, then strict antireflux precautions and high dose proton pump inhibitors are needed to prevent reflux and aspiration of gastric contents. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 95 percent of patients undergoing stent placement for malignant esophageal obstruction improve to the extent that at least liquids will be tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-39</a>]. In patients with malignant dysphagia in the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula, closure of the fistula is successful in 70 to 100 percent of patients, even when the malignancy is close to the upper esophageal sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60771\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60771 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. However, subsequent tumor ingrowth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> overgrowth are common as the cancer progresses and many patients (up to 50 percent in one series) will require additional interventions for recurrent dysphagia or adverse events related to the stent, such as migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Stent migration and occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, in a study that included 41 patients with malignant esophageal obstruction, patency rates at 30, 90, and 180 days were 94, 78, and 67 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of expandable stents with other modalities for inoperable esophageal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis examined the efficacy of various treatments for dysphagia in patients with inoperable or unresectable esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The meta-analysis included 53 trials with 3684 patients. In the included studies, dysphagia was graded from 0 (normal <span class=\"nowrap\">swallowing/no</span> dysphagia) to 4 (inability to swallow <span class=\"nowrap\">liquids/saliva)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">SEMS versus rigid plastic tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The meta-analysis found that self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) insertion is safer and more effective than rigid plastic tube insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Seven studies with 433 patients compared these two treatments. Four of the studies showed an improvement in dysphagia score in patients who received SEMS compared with those who received plastic tubes. Data from two of the studies (231 patients) could be included in the quantitative analysis. In that analysis, the standardized mean difference of dysphagia grade at four or more weeks post-intervention was -0.36, favoring SEMS. The remaining three studies did not find a significant difference between the two interventions for treatment of dysphagia.</p><p>With regard to recurrent dysphagia, adverse events, and procedure-related mortality, the meta-analysis found that SEMS were again superior to plastic tubes, with odds ratios of 0.41, 0.25, and 0.36 for the three outcomes, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, the improvement in procedure-related mortality was not present in the more recent trials, which performed plastic tube insertion using conscious sedation instead of general anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">SEMS versus laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The meta-analysis concluded that the available evidence does not support the superiority of one modality over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-palliation-of-esophageal-cancer#H107180411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'Laser therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Two trials were included in the meta-analysis with 125 patients. In the first trial, covered and uncovered SEMS both had a median improvement in dysphagia score of 2 at one month, which was significantly better than that for laser treatment (median improvement of 1). In the second trial, there was no significant difference between the two interventions.</p><p>The studies did not demonstrate a significant difference between the two interventions with regard to recurrent dysphagia or treatment related mortality. However, laser therapy is now rarely performed in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">SEMS versus brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The review found that SEMS insertion provided more rapid palliation of dysphagia compared with brachytherapy, but the difference gradually diminished over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-palliation-of-esophageal-cancer#H107181679\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'Brachytherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Furthermore, over time, brachytherapy was associated with better dysphagia improvement and related quality of life scores, along with better general health related quality of life scores. Finally, brachytherapy was associated with a lower incidence of major adverse events (21 versus 33 percent).</p><p>SEMS plus brachytherapy has also been compared with brachytherapy alone. In a randomized trial with 41 patients, patients who received a SEMS followed by brachytherapy were more likely to report improved dysphagia three weeks after treatment compared with those who underwent brachytherapy alone (71 versus 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. After seven weeks, both groups reported similar rates of dysphagia improvement (78 and 83 percent, respectively). In the combination therapy arm, complications included aspiration pneumonia alone (two patients), aspiration pneumonia and bleeding (one patient), and stent dislocation during brachytherapy (one patient). There were no complications among the patients treated with brachytherapy alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1401635869\"><span class=\"h3\">SEMS versus chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective study showed that administration of palliative chemotherapy may allow an adequate response and relief of dysphagia to avoid need for stent placement in nearly 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single study has compared all the available models for cost, efficacy, and safety.

The mean dysphagia score (on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 corresponding to no dysphagia and 4 corresponding to the inability to swallow saliva) improved from a mean of 2.4 prior to stent placement, to 1 following stent placement. The most common adverse event was stent migration, which was seen in 17 patients (31 percent). Other adverse events included chest discomfort (eight patients; generally self-limited and mild to moderate), esophageal reflux (one patient), food impaction (one patient), transient odynophagia (one patient), and esophageal perforation (one patient). </p><p>In another study, biodegradable stents were used preoperatively, with the advantage of not requiring removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Additional studies of patients who undergo esophageal stent placement have raised concerns about the increased risk of toxicity during chemoradiation therapy, the possible negative impact on oncologic outcomes, and the uncertain benefit for nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. For example, in a study of 103 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, patients who had an esophageal stent in place during chemoradiation therapy were more likely to have grade &ge;3 acute toxicity compared with patients without a stent (71 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5391226\"><span class=\"h2\">Stenting for esophageal cancer recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SEMS have been used for the treatment of dysphagia or fistula recurrence following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. One study examined 81 patients with recurrent esophageal cancer following esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. SEMS were placed for dysphagia in 66 patients and for fistula formation in 15 patients. In the patients with dysphagia, the SEMS restored luminal patency in 65 (98 percent), and in the patients with fistulas, the SEMS sealed the fistula in 14 (93 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5391187\"><span class=\"h2\">Stenting for extraesophageal compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that esophageal stents are effective for the treatment of dysphagia due to compression of the esophagus by extraesophageal malignancies, though the degree of symptom improvement may be less than for intrinsic esophageal lesions. In one study of 46 patients, dysphagia scores improved from a median of 3 to a median of 2 in patients with extrinsic compression, compared with an improvement in median score from 3 to 1 in the intrinsic lesion group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In a second study of 50 patients with malignant extrinsic esophageal compression, stents were successfully placed in all patients with restoration of luminal patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In eight patients (16 percent) stent dysfunction occurred. In three of the patients food bolus impaction occurred within one week of stent placement, in two patients there was tumor overgrowth, in two patients the stent migrated, and in one patient there was hyperplastic tissue ingrowth. All patients with stent dysfunction were successfully treated endoscopically. Adverse events included two esophageal perforations related to esophageal dilation that were treated by placement of a covered stent. The only severe adverse event related to the stent itself was hemorrhage, which occurred in three patients, resulting in the death of two patients. Minor adverse events occurred in nine patients (18 percent) and included retrosternal pain and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. More recent studies have confirmed the use of stents for management of extrinsic compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal stents have been used in patients with benign disease, such as for management of refractory strictures and closure of perforations (spontaneous and iatrogenic) and postoperative leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/58-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-65</a>] and for tamponade of esophageal variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] as an alternative to Minnesota or Blakemore balloon tubes, especially when bleeding cannot be controlled with conventional modalities (medical, endoscopic). When SEMS are placed for benign disease, uncovered stents should not be used and partially covered metal stents should generally be avoided because removal may be impossible (uncovered) or difficult (partially covered) when the disease process has resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/7,67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,67-70</a>].</p><p>When partially covered stents are used for benign disease, subsequent removal can be facilitated by use of the stent-in-stent technique whereby a fully covered SEMS or self-expanding plastic stent is placed within the exiting stent. This induces tissue necrosis between the uncovered wires and the newly placed stent. After a duration of 14 or more days, both stents are endoscopically removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/8,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,71</a>].

Approximately 0.5 to 2 percent of patients die as a direct result of stent placement from a variety of adverse events, including those related to sedation, aspiration, stent malposition, or esophageal perforation. In a study of 63 patients who had esophageal stent placement for palliation, adverse events occurred in 40 patients (64 percent) with a mean follow-up of 11 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In a retrospective study of 397 patients who had received esophageal stents for both malignant and benign causes, stent-related esophagorespiratory fistulas developed in 16 (4 percent) after a median of 5 months (range 0.4 to 53 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Fistulas were seen in 6 of 94 patients (6 percent) with proximal esophageal stents, in 10 of 71 patients (14 percent) with midesophageal stents, and in 0 of 232 patients with distal esophageal stents. Factors associated with an increased risk of fistula formation included a higher Charlson comorbidity index score and prior radiation therapy. Morbidity associated with fistula formation included the need for a lifelong feeding tube (50 percent) and the need for a tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation (23 percent).</p><p>In another study, the risk of tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula formation was examined in patients undergoing stent placement for esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The report included 208 patients who underwent stent placement with or without palliative radiation therapy for inoperable locally advanced esophageal cancer. Eighteen (9 percent) developed a TE fistula, 17 of whom (94 percent) had received radiation therapy.

Additional stenting or laser ablation is often needed to treat recurrent obstruction. Good results can be achieved when a second stent is placed through the first stent as a treatment for primary stent occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stents placed across the lower esophageal sphincter produce an open conduit for free reflux of gastric contents with consequent severe regurgitation and aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Patients who have had stents placed across the gastroesophageal junction should be placed on high dose proton pump inhibitors (to prevent ulceration from an acidic refluxate) and be educated about potential aspiration. This includes maintenance of an upright or semi-upright position at all times, which includes raising the head of the bed to approximately 30 degrees.</p><p>As noted above, stents have been developed that have antireflux barriers by means of a one-way flap valve on the gastric side of the stent. In a meta-analysis, antireflux stents were effective in rapidly palliating dysphagia. When compared with conventional SEMS, they were similar with regard to adverse event rates and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Most self-expandable metallic stents materials appear safe for MRI, but factors such as stent shape, magnetic field orientation, and alloy composition may influence signal intensity in vitro; thus, specific details of the stent and its orientation to the magnetic field should be obtained before MRI is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) and the self-expanding plastic Polyflex stent can be used for palliation of symptoms for patients with locally unresectable or advanced metastatic esophageal cancer. They are also used for high-risk surgical patients, those with poor functional status who cannot tolerate radiation or chemotherapy, or those in whom previous treatment failed. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-expandable plastic stents do not appear to have advantages over SEMS for malignant disease. Like fully covered SEMS, plastic stents can be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Plastic stents are also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for benign refractory strictures, whereas metal stents are not. However, both plastic and fully covered stents may be useful for the treatment of benign esophageal diseases in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Self-expandable plastic stents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biodegradable self-expandable stents may be useful for selected patients with benign refractory strictures and for relieving dysphagia in patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy for malignant disease.

However, symptom improvement is significantly greater in patients with primary malignant esophageal lesions. Esophageal stents have been used in patients with benign causes of esophageal obstruction but their role in this setting is unsettled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H5391187\" class=\"local\">'Stenting for extraesophageal compression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with large mediastinal tumors require imaging studies to determine if there is tracheal compression. The endoscopist should be prepared for emergent stent removal and endotracheal intubation if stridor develops. Balloon dilation prior to stent deployment at the level of the stricture may provide clues of airway compromise. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coated metal stents are the treatment of choice in patients with malignant dysphagia in the presence of tracheoesophageal fistula.
