Malignant tumors include adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids), stromal tumors, and lymphomas. Benign lesions that may arise in the small bowel include adenomas, leiomyomas, fibromas, and lipomas.</p><p>The diagnosis and staging of small bowel tumors will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of the specific types of tumors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of small bowel neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055480269\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of small bowel neoplasms may include one or more of the following: pain, obstruction, bleeding, anorexia, weight loss, perforation, or in the case of a duodenal primary, jaundice. Malignant tumors are more likely to be symptomatic as compared with benign lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The variable nature of the presenting symptoms, combined with the lack of physical findings, can contribute to a delay in diagnosis in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study, failure to obtain a proper diagnostic test or misinterpretation of test results accounted for delays of 8 and 12 months, respectively; by comparison, the estimated diagnostic delay due to the patient's failure to report symptoms was less than two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As prognosis is closely linked to disease extent for all of the major malignant small bowel tumors, early detection and treatment can contribute to a favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Because of the vagueness and nonspecificity of the presenting symptoms, a high index of suspicion is essential for early diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3486492273\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose symptoms are such that a small bowel tumor is part of the differential diagnosis should undergo a complete history, physical examination, and screening for fecal occult blood. A minimum laboratory work-up should include a complete blood count, measurement of serum electrolytes, and liver function tests.</p><p>The specific components of the diagnostic and staging workup are addressed in the following sections. There is no single method that is best for imaging of the small intestine in a patient with a suspected small bowel tumor. The choices are radiographic (computed tomography [CT] scan, small bowel series, enteroclysis) or endoscopic (wireless capsule endoscopy, push enteroscopy, double-balloon endoscopy).</p><p>Depending on the clinical scenario, multiple tests may be needed to adequately evaluate the small intestine. The best testing strategy and sequence of diagnostic tests are not established, and there is debate as to how much diagnostic workup is adequate to exclude a small bowel tumor. If the suspicion of a small bowel tumor is high, one school of thought holds that at least two imaging methods (eg, wireless video capsule endoscopy followed by double balloon enteroscopy) should be used to exclude a small bowel malignancy. However, there is no consensus on this issue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wireless-video-capsule-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wireless video capsule endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple radiographic investigations are available for patients suspected of having a small bowel tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62087 \">table 1</a>). Plain abdominal films are generally of limited value unless bowel obstruction is suspected, a condition which is a nonspecific finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">UGI/SBFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow through <span class=\"nowrap\">(UGI/SBFT)</span> may show a mass lesion, mucosal defect, or intussusception. In older series, the sensitivity was approximately 50 to 60 percent for the detection of advanced small bowel tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In one report of 89 patients with small bowel tumors, <span class=\"nowrap\">UGI/SBFT</span> was diagnostic in 57 percent of malignant tumors but only 25 percent of primary benign tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is frequently obtained when evaluating vague or indeterminate abdominal complaints. CT is able to detect abnormalities in approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients with small bowel tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73944\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73944 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Besides demonstrating the primary tumor, CT scans are of critical importance for appropriate evaluation of extraintestinal spread to distant sites and involvement of regional lymph nodes. In addition, specific radiographic features may suggest the histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>As an example, for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), an abdominal CT with intravenous and oral contrast has a sensitivity of 77 to 87 percent for identifying at least one of the manifestations of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. This may be the primary tumor, mesenteric stranding due to tumor involvement and a fibrotic response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78186 \">image 2</a>), liver metastases (which are invariably present when carcinoid syndrome arises from a gut primary), or mesenteric lymph node enlargement. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver is more sensitive than abdominal CT for evaluating both the presence and extent of liver metastases in patients with a NET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Accurate staging might be best achieved at the time of laparotomy. The utility of somatostatin receptor-based diagnostic imaging in tumor localization is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tumor localization by somatostatin receptor-based imaging techniques'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiography and radionuclide scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with active bleeding, angiography or radionuclide scanning with technetium (99mTc) sulfur colloid or 99mTc pertechnate-labeled autologous red blood cells can help to localize the site of bleeding. In addition, for certain tumors, most notably NETs and leiomyosarcoma, a distinctive tumor blush may be seen on angiography. However, these tests are rarely indicated in the initial diagnostic workup. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-small-bowel-bleeding-formerly-obscure-gastrointestinal-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Enteroclysis and enterography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteroclysis is a double-contrast radiographic study that is performed by passing a tube into the proximal small bowel and injecting both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>. This technique is superior to <span class=\"nowrap\">UGI/SBFT</span> to detect malignant small bowel tumors. As an example, in one study, the sensitivity of enteroclysis for picking up a malignant small bowel tumors was 90 versus 33 percent for conventional <span class=\"nowrap\">UGI/SBFT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One potential downside is that enteroclysis usually fails to detect flat infiltrating lesions.</p><p>Newer techniques that are performed in conjunction with CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI (termed CT or MR enterography rather than enteroclysis) appear more promising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/5,6,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,19-24</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24724378\"><span class=\"h4\">CT enterography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT enterography is an alternative to enteroclysis that does not require placement of a nasogastric tube for contrast administration; it is better tolerated by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients ingest a large volume of an attenuation-neutral enteric contrast material (often low-concentration <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> or water). This results in distension of the small bowel lumen with a contrast agent that does not interfere with the ability to visualize the lumen and the bowel wall with CT.</p><p>In one of the largest series, 219 patients with a clinical suspicion for small bowel neoplasms and a negative upper and lower endoscopic evaluation underwent contrast and water-enhanced multidetector CT enterography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Positive findings were compared with the results of surgical exploration or endoscopic procedures, while negative results were correlated with the results of surgery, intraoperative enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy, or clinical follow-up.</p><p>A small bowel mass was demonstrated in 55 patients, which was confirmed in 50 (ie, there were five false-positive studies). These included two masses diagnosed as fold thickening at preoperative enteroscopy, two small bowel polyps, and one 18 mm hyperintense mass, with all three cases confirmed as normal mucosa at surgery or preoperative enteroscopy.</p><p>Of the 164 patients with a normal result, a small bowel tumor was later found in nine. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were 85, 97, 95, and 91 percent, respectively.

The studies were independently interpreted by two different gastrointestinal radiologists who were blinded as to the clinical history. Eighty-six of the studies were correctly interpreted (diagnostic accuracy 95 percent); a small bowel neoplasm was confirmed histopathologically (by endoscopy or surgery) in 32. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94, 95, 91, and 97 percent, respectively, for one of the radiologists and 91, 97, 94, and 95 percent, respectively, for the second radiologist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study of 158 patients suspected of small bowel neoplasms after negative upper and lower endoscopies, preoperative MR <span class=\"nowrap\">enteroclysis/enterography</span> identified 31 of the 32 small bowel tumors (97 percent) with no false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The ability of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> to detect local and distant metastatic disease has not been formally evaluated. However, it seems reasonable to extrapolate from the experience with colorectal adenocarcinoma, in which PET scanning is useful as an adjunct to other imaging modalities for localizing sites of disease recurrence in patients with a rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) posttreatment and nondiagnostic conventional imaging, and for evaluation of patients who are thought to be candidates for resection of isolated colorectal cancer liver metastases, in whom the routine use of PET prior to attempted resection reduces the number of nontherapeutic laparotomies.

Of the histologies most commonly seen in the small intestine, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma are typically FDG-avid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In contrast, marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma have variable FDG-avidity. Many clinicians incorporate PET into the pretreatment evaluation of patients with DLBCL of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but its utility in other subtypes is controversial. This issue is addressed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-primary-gastrointestinal-lymphomas#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of primary gastrointestinal lymphomas&quot;, section on 'Lymphoma of the small intestine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1418955706\"><span class=\"h4\">Sarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PET is highly sensitive (86 to 100 percent) for detecting tumors with a high glucose metabolism, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and PET can be useful for detecting an unknown primary site or resolving ambiguities from CT (eg, when the CT findings are inconclusive or inconsistent with the clinical findings). However, because of limitations in specificity, PET has not replaced CT as the initial imaging modality of choice in patients suspected of having a GI tract mesenchymal tumor. </p><p>While a baseline PET may be indicated for patients in whom PET will be used to monitor the response to therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nearly all the data obtained by PET scan imaging can be found in a good quality traditional intravenous (IV) contrasted CT scan, with superior anatomic definition.

In contrast, FDG-scanning is indicated with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Newer tracers for functional PET imaging have been developed, and at least one (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> [68-Ga DOTATATE]) is approved in the United States for use in conjunction with integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for diagnostic imaging of NETs.

This relatively new technology has already supplanted some of the older techniques, such as enteroclysis, in the workup of small bowel tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wireless-video-capsule-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wireless video capsule endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The utility of VCE in diagnosing small bowel tumors was demonstrated in a retrospective study of 562 patients who underwent the procedure at Mount Sinai Medical Center from 2001 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Indications for endoscopy were suspected small bowel bleeding (79 percent), chronic abdominal pain (5 percent), or search for a well-differentiated NET primary (4 percent). A total of 50 patients were diagnosed with small bowel tumors, of which 48 percent were malignant. Among patients who were younger than 50 years old undergoing VCE for suspected small bowel bleeding, nine (13 percent) had a small bowel tumor. There was one false-positive result (which prompted a negative surgical exploration), but the number of false-negative studies could not be ascertained as information on outcomes among patients who had a negative VCE was not available.</p><p>Information on the false-negative rate of VCE was provided in a meta-analysis of 530 patients from 24 studies in which VCE was compared prospectively with a standard diagnostic workup (push enteroscopy in 300 patients, small-bowel series in 140 patients, or colonoscopy with ileoscopy in 90 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A total of 106 neoplasms were diagnosed, of which VCE missed 20 (false-negative rate 19 percent). However, this was lower than the miss rate for the standard diagnostic workup method (63 percent).</p><p>The main disadvantage of VCE is that it does not permit tissue sampling. It should generally not be performed in patients in whom small bowel obstruction is suspected since the capsule may become lodged proximal to the obstruction and may require laparotomy for retrieval.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Enteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteroscopy refers to the passage of a colonoscope or special enteroscope beyond the ligament of Treitz using push, intraoperative, or double-balloon enteroscopy techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The main advantage compared with wireless VCE is the ability to obtain tissue samples and perform therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Enteroscopy can be complementary to VCE by allowing for tissue sampling of lesions identified during VCE. However, the procedure is invasive, can be technically challenging (hence not always successful in visualizing the entire small bowel), and the required expertise and equipment are not always available.
