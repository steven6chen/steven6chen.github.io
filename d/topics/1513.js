The condition puts you at risk of stroke, heart attack, and other problems. Another term for atrial fibrillation is &quot;A-fib.&quot;</p><p>In people with A-fib, the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are abnormal. As a result, the top 2 chambers of the heart stop pumping effectively, and a small amount of the blood that should move out of these chambers gets left behind. As the blood pools, it can start to form clots. These clots can travel to the brain through the blood vessels, and cause strokes.</p><p>In some people, A-fib never goes away. In others, A-fib can come and go, even with treatment. If you had one or more bouts of A-fib, but have a normal heart rhythm now, ask your doctor what you can do to keep A-fib from coming back. Some people can reduce their chances of having A-fib again by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Controlling their blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not drinking a lot of alcohol in one sitting (limit to 1 to 2 drinks in one day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting down on caffeine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting treatment for an overactive thyroid gland</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting regular exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight (if they are overweight)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23384105\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with A-fib have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling as though your heart is racing, skipping beats, or beating out of sync</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild chest &quot;tightness&quot; or pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or like you might pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having trouble breathing, especially with exercise</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23384112\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for atrial fibrillation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have A-fib, he or she will probably do a test called an electrocardiogram. This test, also known as an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG,&quot; measures the electrical activity in your heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23384119\"><span class=\"h1\">How is atrial fibrillation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, A-fib goes away on its own, even without treatment. But some people do need treatment.</p><p>Treatment can include one or more of these:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to keep clots from forming</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called &quot;cardioversion&quot; that involves applying a mild electrical current to the heart to fix its rhythm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments called &quot;ablation,&quot; which use heat (&quot;radiofrequency ablation&quot;) or cold (&quot;cryoablation&quot;) to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending abnormal electrical signals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a pacemaker that is implanted in your body and sends electrical signals to the heart to control the heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23384126\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with A-fib are able to live normal lives. Still, it is important that you take the medicines your doctor prescribes every day. Taking your medicines as directed can help reduce the chances that your A-fib will cause a stroke. It's also a good idea to learn what the signs and symptoms of a stroke are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23384203\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-and-atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure and atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial flutter (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-direct-oral-anticoagulants-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Direct oral anticoagulants (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-abnormal-heartbeats-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for abnormal heartbeats (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cardioversion (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
