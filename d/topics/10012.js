While over 6000 transplants are performed annually in the United States, more than 2000 candidates die each year on the liver transplant waiting list. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) provides one means to expand organ availability. Living-donation of the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver has become highly successful in pediatric transplantation. Some transplant centers perform adult-to-adult right lobe and, less commonly, left lobe LDLT.</p><p>Advantages of LDLT include thorough donor screening, optimization of timing for transplantation, and minimal cold ischemia time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. LDLT has also been associated with lower recipient mortality compared with waiting for a deceased donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A decision analysis concluded that the addition of LDLT to a standard waiting list for deceased donor liver transplantation was effective at improving recipient survival and preventing waiting list deaths, but at greater cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By contrast, a later cohort study found that the costs were similar to deceased donor transplantation when LDLT was performed in highly experienced transplant centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, LDLT poses a risk to the donor. The number of LDLT procedures performed in the United States peaked at 519 in 2001 and then decreased to approximately 320 per year starting in 2003 as enthusiasm for the procedure was tempered by concerns about complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review living donor liver transplantation. Other issues regarding liver transplantation, such as patient selection, medical care of the post-transplantation patient, selection of organs from deceased donors, and complications are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Long-term management of transplant recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-overview-of-immunosuppression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Overview of immunosuppression&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-donor-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Donor selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications in liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETHICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ethical concerns regarding living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are related to the potential for donor morbidity and mortality. Opponents argue that it is unacceptable to place a healthy donor at risk of long-term debility or death. Donation of the left lateral segment or left lobe, used primarily in pediatric transplantation, is associated with a 5 to 10 percent chance of surgical complications and a mortality rate of less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The estimated mortality for right lobe donation, used in adult-to-adult LDLT, is around 0.5 percent. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Donor outcomes'</a> below.) </p><p>Despite these risks, proponents of LDLT suggest that it is unethical to deny an informed and willing adult the opportunity to participate in the donation process. Furthermore, a survey of potential donors suggested that they were willing to accept mortality rates that far exceeded the estimated risk of donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In pediatric transplantation, parents or other close family members may choose to donate in an effort to aid an ailing infant or child. The benefit to the recipient is clear: access to a life-saving transplant. In addition, the donor benefits from the continued survival of the recipient and from increased self-esteem derived from actively contributing to the child's survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Adult LDLT raises additional complexities. Potential donors are healthy adults who are often younger than the transplant candidate. Family pressures may come to bear on an ambivalent relative with the correct blood type and body habitus. Accepting a spouse as a donor could leave children orphaned if complications occur. Patients with fulminant hepatic failure require urgent transplantation, leaving little time for donor counseling and reflection.</p><p>The above issues in adult-to-adult transplantation were considered by an ethics committee of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, which issued an official position statement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65453 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The OPTN ILDA requirements also fulfill the requirements of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate&quot;, section on 'Donor evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition to these requirements, each transplant center develops specific protocols based on their experience and population of donor candidates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2406568023\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important step in the screening process is education regarding the risks of living donation. A thorough psychosocial assessment is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Every effort should be made to confirm that consent is informed and to ensure that the prospective donor has adequate time to contemplate the risks of the procedure and to decline participation, if desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Computed tomographic (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to estimate the volume of the left lateral segment or right lobe to assess whether the mass is sufficient to support a particular recipient (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adult LDLT recipient outcomes'</a> below). CT or MRI further serves to identify space-occupying lesions and give an indication of the presence of steatosis. MRI also provides a noninvasive method to obtain a preoperative cholangiogram. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794187868\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-appropriate cancer screening is indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Cancer'</a>).

The practice of assessing liver histology in living donor candidates is supported by the biopsy findings of 201 healthy appearing potential donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. More than one-half had abnormal biopsy findings, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, and other pathology such as fibrosis, hepatitis, and granulomatous reactions. The degree of steatosis identified on liver biopsy may be used to correct volumetric estimates of hepatic mass. Suitable donors can use autologous blood banking to prepare for surgery.

Forty percent of liver donors experience at least one postoperative complication. Additional considerations for donor selection include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1155034316\"><span class=\"h4\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OPTN policy requires that donors who are both less than 18 years old and mentally incapable of making informed decisions are excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The upper age limit for donors varies depending on the specific program requirements and donor availability. A study comparing outcomes by donor age (&ge;50 versus &lt;50 years, range 20 to 63 years) found no significant difference in complications based upon donor age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, among donors who were &ge;50 years old, right hepatectomy with middle hepatic vein harvesting, or donation that resulted in &lt;35 percent remnant liver volume was associated with an increased risk of major complications. A second study with 378 donors found no difference in outcomes based on donor age (50 to 60 years versus &lt;50 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H416138847\"><span class=\"h4\">Increased BMI and hepatic steatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another factor that limits the number of available donors is the presence of significant hepatic steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Steatosis is seen on liver biopsy in 76 percent of donors with a BMI &gt;28 and is associated with poor recipient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Outcomes including donor and recipient complication rates, recipient graft function, and length of stay did not differ if the liver donor had a BMI &lt;30 versus &ge;30.

The left and middle hepatic veins are dissected, as are the left hepatic artery and left portal vein. Small portal vein branches are ligated. The left bile duct is divided, taking care not to injure the common bile duct. Vascular and biliary structures entering segment 4 are divided or left intact, depending upon whether the left lateral segment or full left lobe is required. The parenchyma is transected and then the left hepatic artery and left portal vein are divided, releasing the graft. The middle hepatic vein is removed with the graft when a full lobectomy is performed. The graft is flushed with preservation solution in preparation for implantation. If extension of the hepatic artery is needed, deceased donor vein grafts or, less commonly, a portion of the donor&rsquo;s saphenous vein, may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. </p><p>Critical parts of the recipient operation include the vascular and biliary anastomoses. The living donor's vena cava is preserved, so the donor hepatic vein is anastomosed directly to the recipient vena cava or hepatic vein. The graft is rotated approximately 45 degrees to protect venous outflow. A low rate of arterial thrombosis has been achieved by using microvascular techniques to perform an end-to-end arterial anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Portal vein reconstruction may include an interposition vein graft <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> branch patch depending upon portal vein length and diameter mismatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The left hepatic duct is anastomosed to a Roux-en-Y loop of small bowel or a duct-to-duct anastomosis is created to complete the biliary reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Right lobe transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right lobe accounts for approximately two-thirds of the liver mass and provides adequate tissue to support the metabolic needs of an adult recipient. The right lobe also fits correctly into the right subphrenic space, making the vascular anastomoses easier to perform. However, the extent of the resection may put the donor at increased risk for complications compared with donation of smaller segments. Furthermore, right lobe grafts are prone to a variety of technical complications.</p><p>Techniques for right lobe transplantation vary, but the following represents a standard approach. After cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound may be used to delineate the position of the hepatic veins and portal branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The right hepatic artery and right portal vein are dissected, followed by the retrohepatic vena cava, isolating the origin of the right hepatic vein. The middle hepatic vein is not dissected at most centers, although accessory hepatic veins greater than 5 mm may be preserved to improve outflow from the graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The right bile duct is isolated, completing mobilization of the right lobe. The liver parenchyma is transected using an ultrasonic scalpel (Cavitron). Doppler ultrasound may be used to assess inflow to the remaining left lobe. The main vessels are then divided and the isolated right lobe is flushed with preservative solution in preparation for implantation. Any bleeding of the donor's left lobe is controlled with sutures and fibrin glue is applied to the cut surface prior to closure.</p><p>Implantation of the graft starts with end-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient right hepatic veins. A portoportal anastomosis is then made between the donor right portal vein and the portal vein of the recipient. The hepatic artery anastomosis is completed using microvascular techniques. Next, an end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy (and increasingly commonly, duct-to-duct anastomosis) is performed with or without internal stent placement, followed by abdominal closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64991\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64991 \">figure 1</a>). Serial Doppler ultrasound is performed in the postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369012568\"><span class=\"h2\">Pediatric LDLT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scarcity of appropriate sized deceased donor organs for infants and children awaiting liver transplantation served as the impetus for advances in segmental liver transplantation.

With increased experience, LDLT has become a highly successful method of transplantation in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1109629663\"><span class=\"h1\">RECIPIENT OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3321989533\"><span class=\"h2\">Pediatric LDLT graft survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One-, three-, and five-year patient and graft survival from living donor grafts in children younger than two years-old exceed those of deceased donor grafts according to data from the US Scientific registry of Transplant Recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and from other large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

One multicenter report summarized outcomes of 385 transplants performed at nine centers (the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort [A2ALL] study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Ninety-day and one-year graft survival rates were 87 and 81 percent, respectively. Graft failure within 90 days occurred in 51 transplants (13 percent), primarily because of vascular thrombosis, primary non-function, and sepsis. Biliary complications were common (30 percent early and 11 percent later). Older recipient age and length of cold ischemia time were significant predictors of graft failure. Center experience with more than 20 transplants was associated with a significantly lower risk of graft failure. A follow-up study found similar results when 67 non-A2ALL centers were compared with the A2ALL study sites, suggesting that the results of the A2ALL study are generalizable within the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

However, these outcomes are not always directly comparable since most recipients who received a live donor graft were far less sick than patients who received a deceased donor graft. A study that compared 153 LDLT recipients and 350 deceased donor recipients who had similar Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores at the time of listing found that LDLT patients had shorter waiting times, lower MELD scores at the time of transplantation, and a one-year survival advantage from the time of listing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Bile leaks, unplanned re-exploration, hepatic artery thrombosis, and portal vein thrombosis were more common in LDLT recipients. After experience with 20 LDLT procedures, the rate of biliary complications remained higher with LDLT, while the rates of other recipient complications were similar between LDLT and deceased donor cases.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 19 studies that included 5450 patients compared outcomes of LDLT with deceased donor recipients. Living donor recipients had longer operative times, shorter cold ischemia times, and higher rates of biliary and vascular complications and re-transplantation. Biliary complications decreased with center experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Long-term survival rates were examined in another report from A2ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. That study compared survival between 963 patients who received a LDLT and 464 deceased donor graft recipients. After adjustment for confounders such as MELD score, survival at 10 years was similar between those who received a LDLT and those who received a deceased donor graft (70 versus 64 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 0.98).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3831467087\"><span class=\"h3\">Graft size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early allograft dysfunction (EAD) can occur when living donor grafts are too small to achieve adequate function (small-for-size syndrome). A graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) of 0.8-1 percent is generally adequate. The Kyoto group analyzed the outcomes of 276 LDLT recipients as a function of GRWR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Patients who received grafts that were less than 1 percent of body weight had prolonged biochemical evidence of graft dysfunction and a lower rate of graft survival. Multiple studies have examined the effect of GRWR on graft function and graft survival. </p><p>An analysis of 631 LDLT recipients defined EAD based on post-operative day 7 laboratories (total bilirubin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> or INR &gt;1.6). Use of left lobe grafts, lower left lobe graft weight, higher recipient bilirubin level, higher portal reperfusion pressure, older donor age, and higher donor body mass index were associated with EAD, which in turn was associated with a 5-fold increase in graft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Lower GRWR may be adequate in selected cases including those with younger donors with high quality grafts, lower recipient MELD score, optimal venous outflow reconstruction, and modulation of portal pressure when the recipient has severe portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/22,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,58-61</a>]. As an example, a study showed that a reduction of recipient portal pressure to &lt;15 mmHg by splenectomy or portosystemic shunt improved outcomes and allowed for the use of grafts with a GRWR of &lt;0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1515035786\"><span class=\"h3\">Recipient age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Living donor liver transplant is generally reserved for younger recipients. However, in a carefully selected group of 46 LDLT recipients age 65 years and older with preserved functional status and a low MELD score (mean 15) at the time of transplantation, graft survival rates were similar to those seen with younger LDLT recipients at the same center. Rates of neuropsychiatric complications were greater in the older recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While mortality rates among donors are low, early death and acute liver failure can occur. In addition, donors are at risk for significant morbidity following donation.</p><p>A systematic review examined donor outcomes from 214 studies (predominantly case series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The review estimated that approximately 6000 living donor liver transplantations had been performed worldwide, with 12 to 13 donor deaths (0.2 percent). The median reported morbidity rate was 16 percent (range 0 to 100 percent). The most common morbidities were biliary leaks and strictures (median 6 percent; range 0 to 39 percent) and infections (median 6 percent; range 0 to 29 percent). Nearly all donors had returned to normal function by three to six months. Other reported complications include incisional hernias, pleural effusion requiring intervention, and neurapraxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>A subsequent large study examined mortality rates among 4111 donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Early death (within 90 days of donation) occurred in seven donors (0.2 percent), and acute liver failure occurred in five (0.1 percent), one of whom died and three of whom underwent deceased donor liver transplantation. Early mortality did not differ significantly among patients who donated their left lobe (0.3 percent), their left lateral segment (0.2 percent), or their right lobe (0.2 percent). All of the patients with acute liver failure had donated their right lobe, though the authors do not comment on whether this was statistically significant. Long-term mortality was similar for live liver donors, live kidney donors, and healthy participants of the national Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1.2, 1.2, and 1.4 percent, respectively, at 11 years follow-up).</p><p>Factors that may increase the risk complications include right lobe donation and low remnant liver volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>], whereas donation in more recent years may decrease the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In addition, some studies suggest right lobe liver donation may affect donor quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. The following are illustrative of the range of findings in the largest studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single center study involving 1162 transplantations (of which 588 were right lobe) between 1994 and 2005, major complications were observed in 3.2 percent of donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The rate of serious complications decreased in more recent years (to 1.3 percent), when resections exceeding 65 percent of whole liver volumes were avoided, except for young donors without steatosis. The authors noted that complications were also reduced by intensive postoperative surveillance and improvement in surgical techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 81 right lobe donations showed that donors who were left with &lt;30 percent remnant liver volume had higher peak laboratory values, higher day seven bilirubin levels, a longer hospital stay, and an increased risk of complications compared with those with higher remnant liver volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In a second study that included 28 carefully selected donors with &lt;30 percent remnant liver volume and 260 donors with &ge;30 percent remnant liver volume, both groups had had similar postoperative aminotransferase levels, international normalized ratios (INRs), and complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, patients with lower remnant liver volumes had longer hospital stays. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor quality of life was examined in a study that included 24 donors who were followed for four months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Subjects were interviewed and asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Survey regarding psychosocial outcomes and symptoms after surgery. Major and minor complications each occurred in four patients (16 percent each). Complete recovery occurred in 75 percent of subjects at a mean time of 3.4 months. The majority (96 percent) returned to the same pre-donation job at an average of 2.4 months. A change in body image was reported by 42 percent of patients, while 71 percent reported mild ongoing symptoms (mostly abdominal discomfort), which they related to the donor surgery. The mean out-of-pocket cost to the donors was $3660. Despite these problems, all donors stated that they would donate again if necessary.</p><p/><p>Other studies have also shown that many donors report that they would donate again if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. In eight studies from the systematic review, 78 to 100 percent of donors indicated that they would donate again (median 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>In a study of 271 living donors that assessed changes in their interpersonal relationships after donation, the majority of donors reported an improved relationship with the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, 75 percent reported non-medical expenses associated with donation, including lost wages, transportation and housing costs, and 37 percent had out-of-pocket medical costs. Overall, 44 percent reported that donation costs posed a financial burden.</p><p>Donor attitudes about living donation are not uniformly positive. In a retrospective study of 183 potential donors (133 of whom became donors), 34 percent expressed ambivalence, defined as &quot;simultaneous and contradictory attitudes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feelings toward a person (the recipient) or an action (right hepatic lobe donation)&quot; during the evaluation or post-donation follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Donor ambivalence was associated with male gender, age over 35 years, a higher level of education, a recipient with hepatitis C or alcohol-related liver disease, and brother-to-brother or son-to-father donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER REGENERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver regeneration is rapid following living donor liver transplantation. In one report, the volume of small-for-size left lateral segment grafts increased by 60 to 200 percent within one month and approximated standard liver volume by about two months post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Substantial hepatic growth also occurs in the donor during the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], although full restoration of liver volume seems to occur more slowly in the donor than in the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/74,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76</a>]. An analysis of 487 donors from the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort (A2ALL) showed that most laboratory values approached baseline levels within one year of donation, although platelet counts remained below pre-donation levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOLOGIC TOLERANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Living-related liver donation results in an increased degree of donor-recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. It has been hypothesized that such matching may be associated with lower rates of rejection but more aggressive recurrence of viral and autoimmune liver diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. This hypothesis was supported by a series in which donor-recipient HLA-DR matching was associated with a reduced rate of cellular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>However, data regarding the benefits of HLA matching have been mixed. Two reports found a similar rate of cellular rejection among pediatric patients who received a deceased donor or a living-related graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/40,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,79</a>]; although, in one of these reports, the rate of steroid-resistant rejection was lower in the living related group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In another study, five-year graft survival was evaluated as a function of degree of donor-recipient HLA matching in 631 living donor liver transplantation cases contained in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The degree of HLA matching was not associated with time to graft failure in patients with either autoimmune or non-autoimmune causes of liver disease. Some studies have found that perfect HLA matching (a rare occurrence) may even be deleterious by predisposing to graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and post-operative care of living donors can add to the cost of liver transplantation. One analysis compared the cost of care from 90 days before transplantation through one year post-transplantation between adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and deceased donor liver recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-donor-liver-transplantation/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. All living donor costs, including evaluation of rejected and accepted donors, and donor follow-up care for one year were considered, as was the deceased donor organ acquisition fee. The cost of LDLT exceeded that of deceased donor transplantation by 21 percent (approximately $25,000 to $30,000), although this difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has become an accepted practice in pediatric transplantation. Improvements in surgical techniques have minimized the risks of left lateral segmentectomy to the donor and recipient outcomes are now excellent. The relatively small mass of the left lobe of the liver has generally limited the use of left lobe transplantation to pediatric recipients. (See <a href=\"#H3369012568\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric LDLT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult living donor liver transplantation typically involves transplantation of the right lobe, because graft size constraints have generally limited the use of left lobe. Right lobe transplantation confers a higher risk of morbidity and mortality to the donor. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Donor outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Left lobe transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive medical and psychosocial evaluation of the liver donor candidate is required prior to donation. In the United States, it is also mandated that patients meet with an Independent Living Donor Advocate, whose role is to ensure that the donor candidate has received adequate information to make an informed decision and advocate for the rights of the living donor (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Donor selection'</a> above). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) has defined minimum criteria for the medical and psychosocial evaluation of living-donor candidates (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Donor selection'</a> above). Based upon the initial donor evaluation, a donor candidate may be accepted, excluded, or require additional assessment. The OPTN has defined a number of contraindications to liver donation and relative exclusion criteria may vary among transplant centers (see <a href=\"#H376824132\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to donation'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major benefit of LDLT in adults is that it guarantees that a transplant will be performed, and minimizes morbidity and mortality associated with clinical deterioration as potential recipients await a deceased donor graft.
