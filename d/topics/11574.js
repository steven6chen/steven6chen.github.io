Several studies, including the landmark National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) 18 trial, have demonstrated that administration of the same chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant versus adjuvant setting is associated with similar outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-newly-diagnosed-hormone-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. While traditionally neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used to downstage locally advanced and unresectable primary breast cancers, a number of studies have highlighted the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy as an alternative option to chemotherapy in HR-positive tumors, particularly for postmenopausal women.</p><p>In this topic, we will focus on the approaches and data specific to HR-positive breast cancers. For the purpose of this discussion, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.

It is appropriate for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer (regardless of subtype), generally defined as stage III cancers, as well as the subset of IIB cancers with T3 disease. For those with stage II disease, either primary surgery or neoadjuvant therapy may be used, the latter being appropriate, for example, for the patient who desires breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and is not a candidate due to a high tumor size: breast size ratio. It should be recognized, however, that HR-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative cancers are less likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than other biologic subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-newly-diagnosed-hormone-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. For patients with stage I, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative disease, we generally prefer primary surgery rather than neoadjuvant therapy given that such patients are likely to have good surgical outcomes.</p><p>Further discussion of appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy is found elsewhere, including for those with HER2-positive disease.

In such situations, most premenopausal women should receive chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy. If a premenopausal woman refuses (or is not a good candidate for) neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we suggest proceeding to surgical treatment, if possible, rather than attempting neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. For such women who are concerned about the extent of definitive surgical treatment, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy may be offered, but patients should be advised that the data in this setting suggest superior outcomes with chemotherapy over endocrine therapy.

However, for those with HER2-negative tumors that are strongly HR-positive, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is an acceptable alternative option. Tumors that are more likely to respond to neoadjuvant endocrine treatment have strong HR expression (eg, &ge;50 percent staining for estrogen receptor [ER] or an Allred score of 7 or 8) and a low proliferative index (Ki67 &lt;10 or 15 percent).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer#H179173117\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive disease receiving neoadjuvant therapy should be treated with a regimen that combines chemotherapy with HER2-directed agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer#H2915041628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Components of therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postmenopausal women receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, we suggest aromatase inhibitors rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> because of higher efficacy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Some women may, however, prefer the side effect profile of tamoxifen to that of aromatase inhibitors. For such women, tamoxifen is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H774452061\" class=\"local\">'Choice of endocrine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our general approach is to administer neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for four to six months, though a longer duration of treatment may be utilized, if needed, to allow for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients who have stable disease or partial response to endocrine therapy. If progression of disease occurs at any point, we proceed directly to definitive surgical management. (See <a href=\"#H81643856\" class=\"local\">'Duration of endocrine treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with HR-positive breast cancer should continue with adjuvant endocrine therapy, regardless of whether it was administered in the neoadjuvant setting.
