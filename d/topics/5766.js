Finding and treating breast cancer in the early stages allows many women to be cured.</p><p>Following surgery, systemic (body-wide) anticancer treatment is often recommended to eliminate any microscopic tumor cells that might remain in the body. This type of therapy is called adjuvant therapy, and it is a very important component of breast cancer treatment. Adjuvant systemic therapy significantly decreases the chance that the cancer will return (or recur), and it also improves a woman's chance of surviving her cancer.</p><p>There are three options for systemic adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer: endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and trastuzumab (Herceptin). The choice between these treatments depends upon whether the breast cancer is hormone-responsive and whether it makes a protein called HER2.</p><p>This article will focus on adjuvant therapy for <strong>premenopausal</strong> women with hormone-responsive breast cancer. Adjuvant treatment for <strong>postmenopausal</strong> women with hormone-responsive breast cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-stage-breast-cancer-treatment-in-postmenopausal-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Early-stage breast cancer treatment in postmenopausal women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINING HORMONE-RESPONSIVE BREAST CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 50 to 70 percent of breast cancers require the female hormone estrogen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">estradiol</a>) to grow, while other breast cancers are able to grow without estrogen. Estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells produce hormone receptors, which can be estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), or both. These cancers are known as &quot;hormone-responsive&quot;.</p><p>If your breast cancer is hormone-responsive, you are more likely to benefit from treatments that lower estrogen levels or block the actions of estrogen. These treatments are referred to as endocrine or hormone therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINE THERAPY OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of adjuvant endocrine therapy is to prevent breast cancer cells from receiving stimulation from estrogen. &#160;</p><p>The options for endocrine therapy in premenopausal women include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The drug tamoxifen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A drug or surgery that prevents the ovaries from making estrogen (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian suppression'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tamoxifen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tamoxifen (Nolvadex) prevents estrogen from stimulating growth of the breast cancer cells. </p><p>Tamoxifen has been recommended for five years, and the benefits last for at least 10 years after the drug is stopped. However, newer studies show that taking tamoxifen for more than five years does add further benefit, although the risk of side effects such as uterine cancer increases with longer treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tamoxifen may increase the risk of the following, particularly in women over age 55 years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the uterus (endometrial cancer and sarcoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots within deep veins (deep vein thrombosis), usually in the legs, which can travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether tamoxifen increases the risk of stroke, particularly in women under the age of 55, is controversial.</p><p/><p>For most women, the benefits of tamoxifen in preventing a recurrence of breast cancer far outweigh the risks of uterine cancer, blood clots, or other long-term effects. However, the risks may be higher for women with risk factors for blood clots or stroke (eg, prior history of blood clots in the leg or lung, history of smoking).</p><p>Tamoxifen may cause other side effects, particularly hot flashes and vaginal discharge. Premenopausal women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen are discouraged from becoming pregnant. Tamoxifen does not cause infertility. Premenopausal women who are taking tamoxifen and are sexually active should use effective nonhormonal contraception while they are on tamoxifen and for about two months after discontinuing the therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian suppression refers to any treatment that causes the ovaries to stop making estrogen. The ovaries can be suppressed in one of several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical removal of the ovaries (called oophorectomy) or radiation treatment of the ovaries, both of which permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs called gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists stop the ovaries from making estrogen temporarily. The most commonly used drug in this class is goserelin (Zoladex), which is given as a monthly injection. The treatment is usually given for five years.</p><p/><p>For some patients with a breast cancer that may place them at a higher than average risk of recurrence (including those who are 35 years or younger or who underwent chemotherapy), ovarian suppression plus the aromatase inhibitor (AI), exemestane, may be recommended by your doctor. Of note, all forms of ovarian suppression cause a rapid onset of menopause symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness), which can be severe. Treatment for these symptoms is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonhormonal-treatments-for-menopausal-symptoms-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonhormonal treatments for menopausal symptoms (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Aromatase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A class of drugs that is used for endocrine therapy in POSTmenopausal women is the aromatase inhibitors (including anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane). In general, aromatase inhibitors are not given alone to premenopausal women.</p><p>However, women who are premenopausal before treatment may become menopausal; an aromatase inhibitor may then be considered. You should discuss the indications, risks, and benefits of this option with your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINE THERAPY OR CHEMOTHERAPY OR BOTH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrine therapy is recommended for women with ER-positive breast cancer. However, it is not clear if additional treatment (chemotherapy) is also needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most doctors agree that endocrine therapy alone is adequate for premenopausal women with low-risk tumors (ie, those that are node-negative, <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR-positive,</span> small (less than 1 cm) and lacking unfavorable microscopic features) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-stage-breast-cancer-treatment-in-premenopausal-women-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not clear if endocrine therapy alone is enough for women with higher risk ER-positive breast cancers (ie, those with involved lymph nodes, tumor size larger than 1 cm, or unfavorable microscopic features). Chemotherapy certainly provides benefit for <strong>some</strong> women with ER-positive early breast cancer.</p><p/><p>Two tests are available that can help in deciding if chemotherapy might be helpful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called the 21-gene recurrence score assay (also called Oncotype DX&trade;) may be useful to select those women with ER-positive, node-negative early breast cancer who stand to benefit the most from chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A web-based assessment program (Adjuvant!
