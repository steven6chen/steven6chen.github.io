Many people who are bitten by mosquitoes develop an immune response to these proteins. However, only a small proportion of them develop clinically relevant allergic reactions (most commonly large local reactions).</p><p>This topic briefly reviews the types of reactions that may result from mosquito bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It also focuses on large local reactions to mosquito bites and their clinical features, pathogenesis, natural history, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Other issues related to insect bites are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insect bites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of arthropod and insect bites: Repellents and other measures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5318273\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REACTIONS TO MOSQUITO BITES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406753\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical (normal) reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local cutaneous reactions to mosquito bites typically consist of immediate wheals (swelling) with surrounding flares (redness) that peak at 20 minutes and delayed, itchy indurated (firm) papules that peak at 24 to 36 hours and resolve over the next 7 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The typical clinical course of sensitization and natural desensitization to mosquito salivary allergens was described initially in the 1940s. It evolves over months or years in an individual (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63430 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. People who have never been exposed to a particular species of mosquito do not develop reactions to the initial bites from such mosquitoes. Subsequent bites result in the appearance of delayed local skin reactions. After repeated bites, immediate wheals develop. With further exposure, the delayed local reactions wane and eventually disappear, although the immediate reactions persist. People who are repeatedly exposed to bites from the same species of mosquito eventually also lose their immediate reactions. The duration of each of these five different stages differs, depending on the intensity and timing of mosquito exposure. These typical reactions are annoying but not dangerous. The immunologic basis of sensitization and natural desensitization to mosquito bites was described in the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), as well as lymphocytes, appear to be involved in the development of local reactions. Serum mosquito salivary gland-specific IgE and IgG levels correlated significantly with the size of the immediate skin reaction to mosquito bites, while lymphocyte proliferation to mosquito antigens correlated with the delayed reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406760\"><span class=\"h2\">Large local reactions to mosquito bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large local reactions are by far the most common type of allergic reactions to mosquito bites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large local reactions (sometimes referred to as &quot;Skeeter syndrome&quot;) typically consist of an itchy or even painful area of redness, warmth, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> induration that ranges from 2 to more than 10 cm in diameter. Large local reactions develop within hours of the bite, progress over 8 to 12 hours or more, and resolve within 3 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large local reactions can involve the entire periorbital region and much of the face or an entire extremity, especially in an infant or child. They can interfere with seeing, eating, drinking, or normal use of an extremity. Severe large local reactions can be accompanied by low-grade fever and malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By inspection and palpation, it can be difficult to differentiate between allergic inflammation caused by mosquito bites and inflammation caused by secondary bacterial infection (cellulitis) after scratching the bites. It is important to obtain a history of the time of onset of the red, warm swollen area at the site of a witnessed or likely mosquito bite in relationship to the time of the bite. Large local reactions typically begin within hours. Secondary bacterial infections typically begin within days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sometimes large local reactions develop an ecchymotic appearance or form blisters, vesicles, or bullae in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Wells syndrome (eosinophilic panniculitis), or hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406767\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic allergic reactions to mosquito bites include papular or acute generalized urticaria and rarely, anaphylaxis, serum sickness, or some combination of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and necrotic skin reactions at mosquito bite sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A patient with systemic mastocytosis and recurrent anaphylaxis associated with mosquito bites has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

All of the children with the large local reactions had been diagnosed initially with bacterial cellulitis and received systemic antibiotic treatment. In two of the children, radiographs were obtained to rule out osteomyelitis underlying the extensive soft tissue swelling.</p><p>An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G 1-4 subclasses (IgG1-4), recognizing salivary gland allergens of the predominant indigenous mosquito, <em>Aedes vexans</em>. In the children with large local reactions, serum levels of IgE, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 to <em>A. vexans</em> salivary gland allergens were significantly elevated, as compared with the levels in control children. Specific IgE and IgG concentrations were significantly higher at the end of summer, as compared with levels at the end of the following winter after no exposure to mosquitoes had occurred for six months. Thus, it appears that large local reactions involve the same mechanisms (IgE and IgG antibody production) and as smaller, typical reactions. Those with large local reactions mount a more robust immune response, yet still eventually undergo the same natural desensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406781\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF LARGE LOCAL REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of large local reactions to mosquito bites appears to be favorable. Children often continue to develop recurrent large local reactions to mosquito bites for several summers, after which the reactions cease to occur. However, the time to resolution varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], depending on the frequency and intensity of the patient's exposure to mosquitoes, which may be reduced by efforts to avoid mosquitoes and prevent mosquito bites.</p><p>In a study of sera from 402 children living in the region of Canada where large local reactions to mosquito bites were originally described, levels of mosquito saliva-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) correlated inversely with age, peaked at one to six months of age, and decreased after five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this geographic region, only 18 percent of 1059 adult blood donors had demonstrable antibodies to mosquito salivary allergens, suggesting that in most adults, sensitization had been lost and natural desensitization had occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406788\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of large local reactions to mosquito bites is based on history and physical exam, as laboratory testing is not commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84346388\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is based on the time of onset (hours) of the reaction in relationship to a witnessed or likely mosquito bite and on the physical finding of an itchy, red, warm swollen area at the site of the bite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84346395\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing or serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody testing for the presence of antibodies to mosquito saliva is not practical, because the only commercially available mosquito reagents are unstandardized whole body extracts that contain minimal mosquito salivary allergens, yet may contain irritant proteins. Obtaining pure mosquito salivary allergen for use in skin tests and in vitro tests by dissection of mosquito salivary glands or by direct collection from living mosquitoes is labor intensive and time-consuming. Such allergens are not commercially available. Mosquito bite challenge tests are contraindicated because of the risk of disease transmission through a &quot;wild&quot; mosquito bite and the risk of causing another severe large local reaction in a susceptible patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>].

This interval is typically hours with large local reactions and days with cellulitis.

Treatment of large local reactions involves antihistamines and for severe reactions, glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877634\"><span class=\"h2\">Mosquito avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Written information about insect repellents and environmental control measures to reduce mosquito populations near the home should be provided for patients who have experienced large local reactions and for parents and caregivers of children who have experienced such reactions. Key points are reviewed briefly here and discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of arthropod and insect bites: Repellents and other measures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities should be modified to avoid mosquito bites. Measures might include staying indoors at dawn and dusk and avoidance of wetlands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standing water should be eliminated around the home or other immediate environment in order to reduce breeding areas for mosquitoes. Screens on windows and doors should be well-maintained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The insecticide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">permethrin</a> is suitable for application to fabrics (for example, camp tents, sleeping bags, and clothing) but not for direct application to human skin. Permethrin-impregnated clothes (eg, shirts) are available commercially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different insect repellents are available in a variety of formulations and concentrations. The most effective repellents are DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) and picaridin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Humans attract mosquitoes by their body odor, skin temperature, and exhaled carbon dioxide. DEET-containing products provide excellent protection against bites. The higher the DEET concentration, the longer-lasting the protection. DEET in a concentration of 10 percent can be applied safely to the skin of children over two months of age. DEET is potentially neurotoxic if applied in high concentrations to abraded or sunburned skin or if unintentionally ingested or inhaled. DEET is also a plasticizer, and as such, it can dissolve mosquito nets, spandex, rayon, and leather, as well as plastic eyeglass frames and watches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of arthropod and insect bites: Repellents and other measures&quot;, section on 'DEET'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Picaridin blocks insects' ability to locate human skin by forming a barrier on the skin. It is odorless, leaves no residue, and has long-lasting efficacy (between 8 to 10 hours). Overall, in comparison with DEET, it is more effective against mosquitoes and less potentially toxic to humans. Picaridin can be applied safely to the skin of children over two months of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of arthropod and insect bites: Repellents and other measures&quot;, section on 'Picaridin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other agents, such as citronella and lemon eucalyptus oil, are less effective and relatively short-acting. For example, citronella may be effective for only 20 minutes, and eucalyptus oil may be effective for only two hours.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5317951\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients bitten by mosquitoes in laboratory and field settings, prophylactic oral administration of a nonsedating H1 antihistamine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">loratadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fexofenadine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rupatadine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rupatadine</a> (not available in the United States or Canada), relieved itching in the early-phase allergic reaction and reduced the late-phase reaction (redness, swelling, and induration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. We suggest to patients that a nonsedating antihistamine be taken on a regular daily basis when mosquito exposure is inevitable and that such antihistamines should also be used to treat itching, redness, and swelling that occur at mosquito bite sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5317958\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are used to treat the allergic inflammation associated with large local reactions to stinging insects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-local-reactions-to-mosquito-bites/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This approach has been extrapolated to the treatment of large local reactions to mosquito bites.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To relieve itching, redness, warmth, and swelling, a moderately potent topical corticosteroid cream may be applied twice daily for 5 to 10 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severe, large local reactions that are distressing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interfere with normal vision, ingestion of liquid or food, or ambulation, an oral glucocorticoid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> to a maximum of 50 mg may be given for 5 to 7 days.</p><p/><p>Antibiotic treatment is <strong>not</strong> indicated for large local reactions that develop within hours of mosquito bites, because it is unlikely that bacterial infection would develop this rapidly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406837\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many people who are bitten by mosquitoes become sensitized to mosquito salivary allergens but few develop mosquito allergy, which most commonly presents as large local reactions to mosquito bites. Systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are rare. (See <a href=\"#H5318273\" class=\"local\">'Types of reactions to mosquito bites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large local reactions to mosquito bites are caused by an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergic/immunologic</span> reaction to mosquito saliva. These itchy, red, warm swellings typically develop within hours of bites and resolve with or without treatment over 3 to 10 days. Large local reactions to mosquito bites are most common in young children who have been bitten and sensitized but have not yet developed natural immunity to mosquitoes. These reactions are sometimes accompanied by low-grade fever and malaise. (See <a href=\"#H406760\" class=\"local\">'Large local reactions to mosquito bites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of large local reactions to mosquito bites is made clinically. The key information needed is the time elapsed, measured in hours (not days) between a witnessed mosquito bite or exposure to mosquitoes and a likely mosquito bite and the appearance of an itchy, red, warm, swollen area at the bite site. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment helps avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and unnecessary antibiotic treatment. (See <a href=\"#H406788\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large local reactions to mosquito bites are frequently misdiagnosed as bacterial cellulitis. However, large local reactions to mosquito bites typically develop within hours of a bite, and bacterial cellulitis typically develops a few days later after bite sites have been scratched and excoriated. (See <a href=\"#H406788\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H406795\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of allergic reactions to mosquito bites is difficult to confirm because of lack of availability of high quality, standardized allergens (mosquito salivary gland or saliva extracts) for use in skin tests or in measurement of serum mosquito saliva-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In otherwise healthy children, large local reactions to mosquito bites typically cease to occur within a few years.
