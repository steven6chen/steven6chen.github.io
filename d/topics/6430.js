Erythroderma is the clinical presentation of a wide range of cutaneous and systemic diseases (including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis), drug hypersensitivity reactions, and more rarely S&eacute;zary syndrome, a leukemic subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although uncommon in pediatric patients, erythroderma may be the clinical presentation of a wide range of acquired and inherited diseases, including infections, inflammatory skin diseases, ichthyoses, and congenital immunodeficiencies. </p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of erythroderma in adults. Erythroderma in neonates and infants and S&eacute;zary syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-and-infantile-erythroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal and infantile erythroderma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of S&eacute;zary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12240278\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythroderma is a rare condition. The annual incidence has been estimated to be approximately 1 per 100,000 in the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a retrospective study, erythroderma accounted for 13 in 100,000 patients presenting with skin diseases in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Erythroderma can occur at any age and in both sexes, but is more frequent in older adults (mean age 42 to 61 years) and in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Erythroderma is exceedingly rare in children; its prevalence is estimated to be approximately 0.1 percent in pediatric dermatology clinic populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12240285\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5244727\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous and systemic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of cutaneous or systemic diseases can evolve to or cause erythroderma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87714 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exacerbation of a preexisting inflammatory dermatosis</strong> &ndash; The most common cause of erythroderma is the exacerbation of a preexisting inflammatory dermatosis, most often psoriasis or atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In patients with psoriasis, triggers of erythroderma include the abrupt discontinuation of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant therapy, systemic illnesses, phototherapy burns, medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, antimalarials), or HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity drug reaction</strong> &ndash; A hypersensitivity drug reaction is the second most frequent cause of erythroderma (approximately 20 percent of cases). A wide variety of drugs have been reported to be associated with erythroderma, including penicillins, sulfonamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88412\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88412 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. Multiple patterns of drug reaction, from <span class=\"nowrap\">maculopapular/morbilliform</span> eruption to drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms to toxic epidermal necrolysis, may present with erythroderma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uncommon causes</strong> &ndash; Uncommon causes of erythroderma include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and other hematologic and systemic malignancies, immunobullous diseases, connective tissue diseases, and infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87714 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiopathic </strong>&ndash; In approximately 30 percent of cases of erythroderma, no underlying cause is identified and erythroderma is classified as idiopathic (sometimes called &quot;red man syndrome,&quot; a term which is also used to describe an infusion reaction to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12240306\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of erythroderma is incompletely understood. A complex interaction of cytokines (eg, interleukin-1, -2 and -8 and tumor necrosis factor), chemokines, and intercellular adhesion molecules is believed to play a role in the massive recruitment of inflammatory cells to the skin and elevated epidermal turnover. The increased mitotic rate and decreased transit time of epidermal cells through the skin layers results in exfoliation, with significant loss of proteins, amino acids, and nucleic acids through the skin. </p><p>Increased circulating levels of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin) have been demonstrated in patients with erythroderma secondary to psoriasis or eczema and in patients with S&eacute;zary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate a predominantly Th1 cytokine profile in the dermal infiltrates of patients with erythroderma associated with inflammatory dermatoses and a Th2 profile in the dermal infiltrates of patients with S&eacute;zary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These findings suggest that different pathophysiologic mechanisms may lead to the relatively uniform clinical presentation of erythroderma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12240313\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8845926\"><span class=\"h2\">Onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythroderma may develop acutely over hours or days or evolve gradually over weeks to months. </p><p>The onset is usually abrupt in drug hypersensitivity reactions. A morbilliform or urticarial eruption may first appear anywhere on the skin, then erythematous patches increase in size and coalesce into a generalized bright red erythema with occasional islands of sparing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87792%7EHEME%2F72342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87792 graphicRef72342 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Organ involvement (eg, hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonia) may occur in DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Erythroderma from underlying cutaneous or systemic diseases usually develops more gradually. Erythematous patches may occur anywhere on the skin, enlarge and coalesce over hours to days to weeks to involve nearly the entire skin surface. Initially, the erythematous patches may have the characteristics of the underlying disease, but the specific features of the underlying diseases are often lost after erythroderma has fully developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2942806\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, over 90 percent of the skin is involved; the skin is red and warm to the touch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72342 \">picture 1B</a>). In light-skinned patients, the color of the skin varies from bright pink (characteristic of a drug reaction) to a dusky red (characteristic of chronic erythroderma from many causes). In patients with darker skin tones, these features may be more subtle. Most patients complain of severe skin pain or itching. </p><p>Linear crusted erosions and secondary lichenification may result from rubbing and scratching in chronic erythroderma. On palpation, the skin may feel leathery and indurated. Scaling is a common feature, particularly in erythroderma that has been present for more than a week. Scales can be large, small, or bran-like, and are particularly abundant in patients with underlying psoriasis. </p><p>Palmoplantar keratoderma (hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles) is most often associated with pityriasis rubra pilaris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87793\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87793 \">picture 2A</a>), but also may occur in patients with S&eacute;zary syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83371\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83371 \">picture 3</a>). Nail pitting is characteristic of psoriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70962\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70962 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Moist, crusted lesions on the face and upper trunk often precede the development of erythroderma in patients with pemphigus foliaceous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87796%7EDERM%2F87795\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87796 graphicRef87795 \">picture 5A-B</a>).

Involvement of the eyelids manifests with blepharitis, epiphora (excessive tearing), and ectropion (eyelid eversion). These features may be particularly prominent in patients with chronic erythroderma secondary to S&eacute;zary syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome#H449462700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of S&eacute;zary syndrome&quot;, section on 'Skin lesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2942857\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracutaneous findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with erythroderma often appear uncomfortable, shiver, and complain of feeling cold. Constitutional symptoms (eg, malaise, fatigue, fever, or hypothermia) and signs of high output cardiac failure (eg, peripheral edema, tachycardia) also may be present.

Lymph node biopsy often shows only the features of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy (a benign reactive lymph node enlargement), but may be diagnostic of lymphoma in patient with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL).

Counts of S&eacute;zary cells greater than 20 percent of the circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes are found in S&eacute;zary syndrome, a leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Exfoliation typically begins two to six days after the onset of erythema, starts in flexural areas, and rapidly extends to the entire body surface. Scaling is particularly pronounced in patients with underlying psoriasis. Over weeks to months, hair and nail changes may occur. (See <a href=\"#H2942806\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>The duration of erythroderma is highly variable. Erythroderma due to drug reactions usually resolves in two to six weeks after stopping the culprit drug. In patients with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), resolution of erythroderma may require many weeks to months.

However, some patients, particularly those at the extremes of age and patients with comorbidities, may experience complications. (See <a href=\"#H56307720\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances'</a> below and <a href=\"#H56307727\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56307720\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Profound disturbances in fluid and electrolyte regulation, thermoregulation, and metabolic balance occur with erythroderma. Increased skin perfusion leads to fluid loss by transpiration, and consequent electrolyte imbalance. Heat loss, hypothermia, and compensatory hypermetabolism associated with hyperthermia may occur. The shunting of the blood through the skin due to peripheral vasodilation may result in high-output cardiac failure, especially in older or compromised patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of high-output heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exfoliation of the skin results in significant protein loss that may exceed 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface per day, particularly in patients with erythrodermic psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In approximately one third of patients, the cause cannot be determined and erythroderma is classified as idiopathic. However, ongoing evaluation of patients with idiopathic erythroderma is important, since the underlying cause may become apparent over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of the erythrodermic patient to determine the underlying cause involves a detailed history, physical examination, skin biopsies, and laboratory tests.

(See <a href=\"#H12240313\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H443219475\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythroderma is relatively well tolerated by many patients. However, patients at the extremes of age and patients with comorbidities may experience complications, including high-output heart failure, fluid and electrolytic imbalance, heat loss, hypothermia, compensatory hypermetabolism, protein loss and negative nitrogen balance, hypoalbuminemia, edema, muscle wasting, and secondary skin infection. (See <a href=\"#H8113942\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining the cause of erythroderma is often difficult and involves a detailed history, physical examination, skin biopsy, and laboratory studies. In some cases histology reveals the underlying etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87724 \">table 3</a>), but it is more often nonspecific, and repeated skin biopsies may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H12240350\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are hemodynamically unstable or those with severe symptoms may require hospitalization. Regardless of the specific etiology, the initial management involves:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Replacement of fluid and electrolytes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monitoring of the hemodynamic status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monitoring of body temperature</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nutritional support</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptomatic treatment of skin inflammation and pruritus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of edema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of cutaneous superinfections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the symptomatic treatment of skin inflammation and pruritus, we suggest topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We generally use low-potency to mid-potency topical corticosteroids (groups 4 to 7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 4</a>)) two to three times per day until improvement. (See <a href=\"#H579960\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the underlying etiology of erythroderma has been determined, appropriate treatment of the underlying condition must be initiated promptly. (See <a href=\"#H12240401\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of underlying conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with idiopathic erythroderma that does not respond to topical therapy, we suggest systemic corticosteroids rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We generally use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for 7 to 10 days. Prednisone is then slowly tapered over several weeks to avoid rebound. (See <a href=\"#H3350265\" class=\"local\">'Management of patients with idiopathic erythroderma'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with idiopathic erythroderma should be closely monitored with clinical, histologic, laboratory, or imaging evaluation, since an underlying etiology may become apparent over time. (See <a href=\"#H55421654\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythroderma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sigurdsson V, Steegmans PH, van Vloten WA.
