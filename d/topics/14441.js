Acute RRTs include standard intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs), and hybrid therapies such as prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapies (PIRRTs).</p><p>This topic reviews PIRRT in AKI. CRRTs are discussed elsewhere.

PIRRT includes both convective (ie, hemofiltration) and diffusive (ie, hemodialysis) therapies, depending on the method of solute removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Other terms used to describe PIRRT include sustained low-efficiency (daily) dialysis (SLEDD), sustained low-efficiency (daily) diafiltration (SLEDD-f), extended daily dialysis (EDD), slow continuous dialysis (SCD), go slow dialysis, and accelerated venovenous hemofiltration (AVVH) or hemodiafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The indication for PIRRT is dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI) in a patient who is too hemodynamically unstable to tolerate standard intermittent hemodialysis. In most institutions, standard intermittent hemodialysis (eg, four hours of hemodialysis, three times weekly) is the preferred modality for hemodynamically stable patients with severe AKI. Continuous RRT (CRRT) is preferred to standard intermittent hemodialysis for hemodynamically unstable patients, particularly in the setting of large, ongoing fluid administration.</p><p>PIRRT is an alternative to CRRT for hemodynamically unstable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/2,6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-12</a>]. Similar to CRRT, blood pressures are more stable on PIRRT compared with standard intermittent RRT because the rate of solute and fluid removal is lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Metabolic control is comparable with CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>], and mortality with PIRRT appears to be comparable with other forms of RRT, including CRRT in critically ill patients with AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. A meta-analysis including seven randomized trials and 533 patients found similar mortality and recovery of renal function with PIRRT and CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Moreover, a time-series analysis of three intensive care units (ICUs) from three different countries showed that a change from CRRT to PIRRT was not associated with a change in mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], even when accounting for patient illness severity and underlying trends for improvement in mortality rates of AKI patients over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>PIRRT is useful if the patient requires multiple procedures that would interrupt CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/2-5,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,24-28</a>]. In order to deliver an adequate dialysis dose, CRRT needs to be operating with as few interruptions as possible over 24 hours. Because PIRRT incorporates scheduled time off dialysis (and off anticoagulation, which is often required for both CRRT and PIRRT) procedures may be performed without compromising the dialysis dose.</p><p>In some institutions, PIRRT is used to transition patients from CRRT to standard intermittent hemodialysis as hemodynamic stability improves. PIRRT allows for greater mobilization and rehabilitation of patients because of scheduled time off dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>We use CRRT rather than intermittent hemodialysis, including PIRRT, for patients with acute brain injury or other causes of increased intracranial pressure who have AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This is because intermittent hemodialysis is more likely to worsen cerebral edema via a decrease in mean arterial pressure (which causes compensatory cerebral vasodilation) and via a rapid removal of urea resulting in a shift of water to the intracellular space. Limited data, however, suggest that PIRRT is safe for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2665349935\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS MACHINES AND HEMODIALYZERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIRRT can be performed on most machines that are used for standard intermittent hemodialysis. Machines used for PIRRT should have the capability to run at low blood and dialysate flow rates. Some machines are designed specifically for PIRRT and have specific capabilities for solute removal by convection, diffusion, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Standard extracorporeal circuit tubing and hemodialyzers are used for PIRRT. We generally use high-flux dialyzers. Other membranes may result in lower clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biochemical mechanisms involved in blood-hemodialysis membrane interactions&quot;, section on 'Composition of dialysis membranes'</a>.)</p><p>High-cutoff dialyzers have been studied in PIRRT. High-cutoff dialyzers use a membrane that allows clearance of larger solutes compared with high-flux membranes. PIRRT with high-cutoff membranes may provide better clearance of middle molecules, but the clinical significance of this is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421227972\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nontunneled or tunneled dialysis catheter in a central vein is the preferred access for PIRRT, even among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who have an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not routinely use the <span class=\"nowrap\">AVG/AVF</span> for PIRRT, because the prolonged placement of needles during PIRRT increases the risk of bleeding or injury to the <span class=\"nowrap\">AVG/AVF</span>. However, if there is specific training and careful oversight, AVFs and AVGs may be used if central access cannot be obtained or is not feasible (as for a patient who is anticipated to have only a short stay in the intensive care unit [ICU]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among such patients, the <span class=\"nowrap\">AVF/AVG</span> should be closely monitored to make sure the needles are not dislodged during the prolonged treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4230859441\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For each session, the prescription should specify the time on dialysis, the dialysate composition and flow rate, the ultrafiltration goal and rate, the blood flow rate, and the method of anticoagulation, if any.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3718530539\"><span class=\"h2\">Session length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIRRT should be performed at least three times per week to provide an adequate dialysis dose. The time per session ranges from 6 to 18 hours but is typically approximately eight hours. The length of the dialysis session depends on the needs of the patient (usually the volume that needs to be removed) and hemodynamic stability.</p><p>The time per individual session is often determined after assessing the patient response to the initial ultrafiltration rate (fluid removal per hour). As an example, for a severely volume-overloaded patient who requires the removal of large amount of fluid but is hemodynamically unstable, the ultrafiltration rate should be set as low as possible initially and gradually increased until the maximum tolerable ultrafiltration rate is determined by trial and error. The ultrafiltration goal (ie, desired amount of fluid to be removed in the session) is divided by the maximum tolerable ultrafiltration rate to determine the session length.</p><p>The dialysis time may also be determined by other nondialysis-related factors such as scheduling of procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3072906367\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysate composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysate for PIRRT is either generated on-line, mixed from prepackaged salts prior to the treatment, or provided by the dialysis company as prepackaged fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].</p><p>The optimal dialysate composition varies based on the anticipated duration of treatment. In general, when the duration of PIRRT is eight hours or more, the dialysate solution contains the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bicarbonate of 24 to 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium of 1.5 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p/><p>When the duration of PIRRT is less than eight hours, the dialysate solution contains the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bicarbonate of 28 to 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium of 2 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p/><p>Other constituents (such as sodium and glucose) do not change with duration of treatment.</p><p>Several vendors produce a commercially available dialysate that uses citric instead of acetic acid in the acid concentrate, although it is used infrequently. Citrate use has been reported to decrease extracorporeal circuit clotting during intermittent hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. However, there are insufficient data to recommend the use of citrate dialysate for this purpose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2229804711\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysate flow rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dialysate flow rate ranges from 100 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. We use a higher flow rate, at least initially, for patients with severe acidosis or electrolyte abnormalities since a higher dialysis flow rate allows better solute clearance. However, the dialysate flow rate is also adjusted for the anticipated duration of the session since there is a finite amount of dialysate volume available per session (which is preset by the dialysis machine or by the packaging of dialysate fluid).</p><p>As an example, we initially use a dialysate flow rate of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for individuals with severe acidosis or hyperkalemia. We decrease the dialysate flow rate to 100 or 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> if the anticipated session length is increased to &ge;8 hours, whereas we continue to use a dialysate flow rate of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> if the session is expected to be &lt;8 hours.</p><p>As noted, the session time is influenced by tolerance to ultrafiltration, and unstable patients who do not tolerate the initially set ultrafiltration rate often have the session time lengthened after starting PIRRT (see <a href=\"#H3718530539\" class=\"local\">'Session length'</a> above). In such patients, the dialysate flow rate must be decreased so that there is a sufficient supply of dialysate to last the entire session since some machines allow only 90 liters of dialysate per session (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/10</span> hours = QD 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. Similarly, a jug of dialysate concentrate will last approximately six hours at a QD of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> but 18 hours at a QD of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p>The dialysate flow rates used with PIRRT are lower than those used with standard intermittent hemodialysis (usually approximately 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. The rate of solute removal achieved with low dialysate flow rates has been studied in the setting of continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis and to some extent in slow daily hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The degree to which dialysate is saturated with urea (expressed as the percentage ratio of dialysate urea nitrogen to blood urea nitrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">[DUN/BUN])</span> determines the efficacy of the treatment. Up to a QD of 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> the <span class=\"nowrap\">DUN/BUN</span> approaches 100 percent, implying complete saturation of dialysate with urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>At these low flow rates, diffusive urea clearance is numerically equal to, and therefore limited by, dialysate flow. However, increasing QD above these rates leads to proportionally decreasing gains in urea clearance as the <span class=\"nowrap\">DUN/BUN</span> progressively falls, although this is also dependent upon blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>This phenomenon is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60742\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60742 \">figure 1</a>), where urea clearances were studied in an in vitro system of continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) under conditions of different blood and dialysate flows. The flattening of the curves describes the conditions where increases in blood flow do not enhance clearance. The greater the dialysate flow, the less likely the plateau will occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Large differences in the technical success or patient outcomes of different dialysate flow rates in PIRRT have not been shown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1221712831\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ultrafiltration goal is the amount of fluid that the clinician wishes to remove during the treatment session. The ultrafiltration goal generally varies between 0 and 6 L per treatment, with an average of approximately 3 L. The goal is determined by the volume status, the patient's ongoing fluid requirement (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> and intravenous antibiotics) and the cumulative fluid accumulation since the intensive care unit (ICU) admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Volume overload should be expressed in relative terms (eg, 5 or 10 percent over the body weight on admission) and in absolute terms (eg, +3.7 L). Using absolute terms alone may be misleading since the clinical impact of an absolute volume excess of 3.7 liters would be different in a 120 kg or 42 kg patient.</p><p>Volume status is determined in part by physical examination, hemodynamic indices, and with the use of other invasive and noninvasive techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-hemodialysis-prescription#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute hemodialysis prescription&quot;, section on 'Ultrafiltration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2370870785\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate is the amount of fluid removed per hour.</p><p>The rate is determined by hemodynamic stability and the urgency to remove excess fluid. Setting the initial ultrafiltration rate requires clinical judgment. Among hemodynamic unstable patients, we start with a little as 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> and increase over time. Among patients who are severely volume overloaded but have a stable blood pressure, we will start with a much higher ultrafiltration rate in order to prevent intubation.</p><p>Among volume-overloaded patients, we continue the maximum ultrafiltration rate that is tolerated by the patient and set the treatment time accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H3718530539\" class=\"local\">'Session length'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201756532\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the highest blood flow (QB) that the catheter will allow (generally 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. Higher blood flows may prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit tubings and hemodialyzers. High blood flows do not worsen hemodynamic instability.</p><p>We do not increase the blood flow to increase clearance, particularly if the dialysate flow rate is low. With low dialysate flow rates, increasing the blood flow does not have a large effect on solute clearance, since dialysate is saturated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60742\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60742 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918126131\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally use anticoagulation to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However some clinicians choose to not use anticoagulation in all patients, at least initially. Better clinical outcomes have not been shown with anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation in PIRRT.</p><p>Methods of anticoagulation include systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> and regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). The approach varies among institutions and between the authors of this topic. Both approaches are described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heparin </strong>&ndash; One approach is to use heparin in all patients unless there is a contraindication (generally bleeding). We give heparin 1000 to 2000 unit bolus, followed by an infusion of 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/hour</span> to keep the activated partial thromboplastin time 10 to 20 seconds above or 1.5 times control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/2,8,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,51-54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is a contraindication to heparin, we attempt PIRRT without anticoagulation. If treatments are repeatedly interrupted because of clotting of the extracorporeal system, we use RCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/13,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,55,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) &ndash;</strong> An alternative approach is to use RCA in all patients. RCA is a safe method of anticoagulation in almost all ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. We use low-calcium dialysate (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and infuse a 3 or 4 percent sodium citrate solution into the arterial line of the extracorporeal circuit. The citrate infusion is adjusted to target postfilter ionized calcium concentration of 0.5 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There should be routine surveillance of the citrate infusions and routine laboratory monitoring during PIRRT.

In one model, PIRRT is prescribed by a nephrologist after discussion of the treatment goals for the day with the intensivist.

In the literature as a whole, between 0 and 7 percent of patients were reported to have discontinued hybrid treatment because of intractable hypotension. However, most of these patients were also subsequently unsupportable on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/13,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,51</a>].</p><p>The most rigorous assessment of hemodynamic stability during hybrid treatments is from a randomized, controlled trial that compared CRRT with PIRRT among 39 critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. There was no significant difference between treatments in inotrope dose or number.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3302567794\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormalities of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrolyte concentrations are usually maintained within normal limits.</p><p>Hypophosphatemia commonly occurs with prolonged or frequent PIRRT and requires phosphate supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/13,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,51</a>]. Hypophosphatemia may be avoided by adding phosphate to the dialysate three to four days after initiation of PIRRT.

However, amino acid removal, particularly glutamine, may be significant, depending upon the PIRRT regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>] and the dialyzer used for PIRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Protein intake may need to be increased during PIRRT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) provides intermittent dialysis with long session durations. Solute and fluid removal are slower than with standard intermittent hemodialysis but faster than with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). PIRRT allows for time for procedures without compromising the dialysis dose. PIRRT also allows greater mobilization and rehabilitation of patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and indications for PIRRT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIRRT can be performed on most machines that are used for intermittent hemodialysis. Machines used for PIRRT should have the capability to run at low blood and dialysate flow rates. (See <a href=\"#H2665349935\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis machines and hemodialyzers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred access for PIRRT is a dialysis catheter in a central vein. Among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, we generally do not use the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG), even if available, because of the risk of bleeding or injury. However, if there is specific training and careful oversight, AVFs and AVGs may be used, particularly if central access cannot be obtained or is not feasible (as for a patient who is expected to have only a short stay in the intensive care unit [ICU]). (See <a href=\"#H421227972\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIRRT is performed at least three times per week. The time per session is typically approximately eight hours and ranges from 6 to 18 hours depending on the needs of the patient and tolerance to ultrafiltration. The dialysis time may also be determined by other nondialysis-related factors such as scheduling of procedures. Our prescription is defined above. (See <a href=\"#H4230859441\" class=\"local\">'Prescription'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess that adequate dialysis is being delivered, we check daily labs including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, electrolytes, ionized calcium, and phosphate. We do not perform urea clearance tests (ie, urea reduction ratio or <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V)</span> unless daily labs suggest inadequate dialysis (such as persistently elevated BUN or creatinine). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major complications of PIRRT are hypotension and hypophosphatemia. There may be loss of albumin and amino acids, requiring adjustment of protein intake. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729956\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Mark R Marshall, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Edrees F, Li T, Vijayan A.
