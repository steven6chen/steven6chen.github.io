Bow-legs (genu varum) is an angular deformity at the knee where the apex of the deformity points away from the midline.</p><p>Bow-legs and knock-knees are among the most common musculoskeletal anatomic variations encountered by pediatric primary care providers and a common reason for referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. However, most children with knock-knees or bow-legs have variations of normal lower-extremity development and can be monitored by the primary care provider.</p><p>An understanding of the normal physiologic development of the lower extremity is essential in differentiating physiologic from pathologic alignment. Pathologic causes of knock-knees include posttraumatic (eg, Cozen fracture), rickets (eg, renal osteodystrophy), skeletal dysplasias, mucopolysaccharidosis, and neoplasms. Unlike physiologic knock-knees, these conditions generally do not improve over time and may require treatment with bracing or surgery.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of normal physiologic alignment of the lower extremity, physiologic and pathologic causes of knock-knees, and an approach to the child with knock-knees.
