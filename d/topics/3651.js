Its major disadvantage is its propensity to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea, including <em>Clostridium difficile</em> colitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There has been increased interest in the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> because it achieves high intracellular levels in phagocytic cells, high levels in bone, and appears to be able to reduce toxin production in toxin-elaborating strains of streptococci and staphylococci.

The clinical use of clindamycin is discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews on specific infections.

This agent disrupts protein synthesis by interfering with the transpeptidation reaction, which thereby inhibits early chain elongation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloramphenicol</a> and macrolides such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> also act at the 50s ribosomal subunit and may compete for binding at this site. Clindamycin and the related drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lincomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lincomycin</a> are often discussed along with the macrolides but are not chemically related. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> may potentiate the opsonization and phagocytosis of bacteria even at subinhibitory concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. By disrupting bacterial protein synthesis, clindamycin causes changes in the cell wall surface, which decreases adherence of bacteria to host cells and increases intracellular killing of organisms. The drug also exerts an extended postantibiotic effect against some strains of bacteria, which may be attributed to persistence of the drug at the ribosomal binding site.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic but is bactericidal against some strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes such as <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em>. However, killing activity may vary with drug concentration, bacterial species, and inoculum. Bactericidal activity against <em>B. fragilis</em> is inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Penicillins are more rapidly bactericidal versus <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> than is clindamycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, clindamycin does inhibit production of staphylococcal toxin associated with the toxic shock syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clindamycin has also been shown to almost completely inhibit alpha toxin expression in <em>S. aureus</em> in contrast with beta-lactams, which strongly induce, and fluoroquinolones, which partially induce, expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1249199640\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> generally has in vitro activity against staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. It also demonstrates potent activity against anaerobes such as <em>B. fragilis</em>, <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, <em>Fusobacterium </em>spp, <em>Prevotella melaninogenicus</em>, and <em>Peptostreptococcus </em>spp. However, increasing rates of resistance among <em>B. fragilis</em> have limited its utility against these organisms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is not typically active against <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, enterococci, or <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>. <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </em>and aerobic gram-negative bacilli are usually resistant.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is active in vitro against <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Actinomyces israelii</em>, <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, and <em>Babesia </em>spp. Clindamycin also has some activity against <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>and <em>Plasmodium vivax </em>(both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant strains). Combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> has been tried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; clindamycin should <strong>not</strong> be used alone for the treatment or prevention of malaria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-falciparum-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;, section on 'Chloroquine-resistant malaria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mechanisms of bacterial resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, including modification of the target, inactivation of the drug, or efflux of the drug. Resistance has been conferred by both plasmid- and chromosomally mediated mechanisms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmid-mediated resistance in <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>B. fragilis</em>, conferred by enzymes that methylate specific adenine residues in the ribosomal-binding site in the 23s ribosomal RNA of the 50s ribosomal subunit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In gram-positive cocci, this mechanism also confers resistance to macrolides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin#H2853599975\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin&quot;, section on 'Resistance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alteration of a single 50s ribosomal protein of the receptor site, which also confers resistance to macrolides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenylation conferred by a plasmid-mediated 3-lincomycin 4-clindamycin 0-nucleotidyltransferase that catalyzes the nucleotidylation of the hydroxyl group of position 4 of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This mechanism of resistance is most frequently found in staphylococcal isolates, including <em>S. aureus</em>, and impairs bactericidal activity and reduces activity at high inoculum levels. Although adenylation confers high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lincomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lincomycin</a>, clindamycin resistance may not be detected by routine testing methods. This type of resistance is uncommon and probably not of great clinical importance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative organisms such as <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp, Enterobacteriaceae, and <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp are intrinsically resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> due to poor permeability of the cellular outer envelope to the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Cross-resistance of <em>S. aureus</em> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lincomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lincomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> is complete. In addition, bacteria that are erythromycin-resistant may quickly develop resistance when exposed to clindamycin. Strains of <em>S. aureus</em> have also developed resistance to clindamycin during treatment. Other bacteria such as <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</em>, <em>B. fragilis</em>, <em>Peptostreptococcus </em>spp, and <em>Cutibacterium </em>(formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes </em>have also developed resistance to clindamycin.</p><p>Increasing resistance among group B streptococci has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In a report of group B streptococcal isolates obtained as part of routine prenatal screening in Louisiana, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> resistance was present in 33 percent of 544 isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In 30 percent of strains, clindamycin resistance was constitutively expressed, and in 70 percent it was inducible. Rates of inducible clindamycin resistance in other studies of group B <em>Streptococcus</em> have been substantially lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A resistance phenotype identified in erythromycin-susceptible, clindamycin-resistant strains of <em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> had high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lincomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lincomycin</a> plus high MICs to dalfopristin, a streptogramin-A antibacterial agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, the strains were susceptible to macrolides and quinupristin, a streptogramin B-type antibiotic.</p><p>Rates of resistance of the <em>B. fragilis </em>group to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> have increased over time in the United States and Europe. In the United States, the frequency of clindamycin resistance in <em>B. fragilis </em>increased from 3 percent in 1987 to 26 percent from 1997 to 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Some centers have reported clindamycin resistance rates of <em>B. fragilis </em>to be as high as 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaerobic-bacterial-infections#H771773229\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaerobic bacterial infections&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Since rates of antibiotic resistance within <em>Bacteroides</em> may vary with geographic area and local antibiotic use, local susceptibility patterns should be considered in the selection of empiric therapy. Susceptibility testing for anaerobic bacteria is not routinely performed in the clinical laboratory setting, since the techniques are cumbersome and not well-standardized. However, testing may be indicated in certain clinical situations, including brain abscess, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, prosthetic device or vascular graft infection, and refractory or recurrent bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Testing may be particularly useful in the setting of serious infection, persistent infections, potentially resistant pathogens that will be treated medically rather than surgically, or when prolonged therapy is anticipated.</p><p>The primary benefit of susceptibility testing is not documentation of susceptibility but rather demonstration of unexpected resistance to an antimicrobial that is normally useful. The clinical relevance of documented bacterial resistance in the setting of mixed anaerobic infections remains unclear. An alternative approach to requesting susceptibility testing upon isolation of a <em>Bacteroides</em> spp is to reserve such testing for a clinical treatment failure or recurrent infection and to send an isolate to a reference laboratory at that time.</p><p><em>C. difficile</em> is often resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> but susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. <em>C. perfringens</em> is usually uniformly susceptible, but other clostridial species may be resistant in 15 to 30 percent of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is well absorbed after oral administration and is approximately 90 percent bioavailable. The drug generally distributes well into body tissues but does not achieve significant levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, even during episodes of meningitis. It does penetrate well into bone. Since the drug is actively transported into polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, it may also achieve excellent penetration into abscesses.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is metabolized in the liver to active and inactive metabolites. One active metabolite, N-demethyl-clindamycin, is more active than the parent compound. Clindamycin is excreted in urine and, to a lesser extent, in the bile as metabolites. The half-life in patients with normal renal function is 2.4 hours, but it is extended to approximately six hours in those with renal insufficiency. The half-life of the drug is also extended in patients with hepatic failure. The drug is not appreciably removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common adverse effects associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> are diarrhea and allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea has been reported in 2 to 20 percent of those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>. Typically, the diarrhea is mild and self-limited in nature and resolves upon discontinuation of the drug. Clindamycin has been frequently implicated in antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to <em>C. difficile </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Pseudomembranous colitis caused by overgrowth of <em>C. difficile</em> has been reported in 0.1 to 10 percent of patients receiving clindamycin and can be severe or life threatening. Although this condition has been documented with almost all antibiotics, clindamycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, and the cephalosporins are most frequently implicated, the latter three based upon the frequency of use. In a comparison of clindamycin and ampicillin, pseudomembranes were documented by endoscopy in 2 percent of patients receiving clindamycin and 0.3 percent of patients receiving ampicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Topical and vaginal preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> have also been implicated in causing this disease, which may be attributable to systemic absorption of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clindamycin-an-overview/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Clindamycin should be used with caution among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, since antibiotic-associated diarrhea in this patient population may be particularly intolerable.</p><p>Other gastrointestinal side effects have been reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>. These include nausea, vomiting, flatulence, metallic taste, anorexia, and esophagitis.

If diarrhea occurs, the drug should be stopped. Patients experiencing diarrhea during or after receiving antibiotic therapy should be evaluated for the presence of <em>C. difficile</em> and treated accordingly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1249195076\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is a lincosamide antibiotic that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of anaerobic, streptococcal, and staphylococcal infections. Its major disadvantage is its propensity to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> works primarily by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit of bacteria. This agent disrupts protein synthesis by interfering with the transpeptidation reaction, which thereby inhibits early chain elongation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic but is bactericidal against some strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes such as <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em>. However, killing activity may vary with drug concentration, bacterial species, and inoculum. Bactericidal activity against <em>B. fragilis</em> is inconsistent. Penicillins are more rapidly bactericidal versus <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> than is clindamycin. However, clindamycin does inhibit production of staphylococcal toxin associated with the toxic shock syndrome. Clindamycin has also been shown to almost completely inhibit alpha toxin expression in <em>S. aureus</em>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> generally has in vitro activity against staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. It also demonstrates potent activity against anaerobes such as <em>B. fragilis</em>, <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, <em>Fusobacterium </em>spp, <em>Prevotella melaninogenicus</em>, and <em>Peptostreptococcus </em>spp. (See <a href=\"#H1249199640\" class=\"local\">'Spectrum of activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several mechanisms of bacterial resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, including modification of the target, inactivation of the drug, or efflux of the drug. Resistance has been conferred by both plasmid- and chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Rates of resistance of the <em>B. fragilis</em> group to clindamycin have increased over time in the United States and Europe. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is well absorbed after oral administration and is approximately 90 percent bioavailable. The drug generally distributes well into body tissues but does not achieve significant levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, even during episodes of meningitis. It does penetrate well into bone. Since the drug is actively transported into polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, it may also achieve excellent penetration into abscesses. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> has neuromuscular blocking properties, it should be used with caution in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. Since clindamycin, macrolides, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> target the same ribosomal site, these drugs should not be used in combination. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> is available for oral, parenteral, and topical administration. Clindamycin dosing depends upon the route of administration, the age of the patient, and the indication. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common adverse effects associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> are diarrhea, including <em>C. difficile</em> colitis, and allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific dose adjustments are recommended for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>. However, the half-life of the drug is prolonged in such patients, which could increase the potential for adverse events. Such patients should be monitored closely, and dose adjustments should be considered if toxicity is suspected.
