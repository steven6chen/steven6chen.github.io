Prior to the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), CMV neurologic disease occurred in up to 2 percent of patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], primarily in those with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. However, the incidence of CMV neurologic disease has decreased since ART became available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss AIDS-related CMV neurologic disease. Discussions of other CMV-related diseases in HIV-infected patients are found elsewhere.

The presence of CMV in blood (as measured by culture, CMV DNA amplification, or antigen detection) is a risk factor for the development of CMV disease in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, patients with viremia (eg, those with a positive blood CMV DNA test result) do not necessarily have invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H956809\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Impaired CD4 cell function or number is the key immune deficit that permits uncontrolled CMV replication. Studies in transplant recipients and patients with AIDS indicate that CD4-dependent CMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity is critical for preventing CMV replication and end-organ disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Although most cases of CMV disease occur in patients with a CD4 cell count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> patients may be predisposed before such severe CD4 cell depletion occurs. As an example, in a longitudinal study, patients with AIDS who subsequently developed CMV disease had lower T-cell proliferative responses to CMV, both early and late, compared to patients who did not develop disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Genetic factors may also contribute to this predisposition, since low responses to CMV were more common in those with HLA-B44 and HLA-DR7.</p><p>Viral factors may also impact disease. CMV strains in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected patients with encephalitis may differ significantly from those strains present in the general population. A phylogenetic analysis suggests possible viral recombination events that may have an effect on neurovirulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV neurologic disease can involve the brain, spinal cord, dorsal column nerve roots, or peripheral nerves. CMV inclusions have been identified in astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and capillary endothelia of neural tissue. In the brain, CMV disease is characterized histologically by one of three patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microglial nodules that are dense aggregates of macrophages <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rod cells occurring in gray matter more often than white matter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal parenchymal necrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventriculoencephalitis with focal or diffuse destruction of the ependymal lining and periventricular tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p>In the spinal cord, nerve roots, and peripheral nerves, CMV disease can cause subpial necrosis, axonal destruction, myelin degeneration, and a focal, polymorphonuclear necrotizing vasculitis of epineural arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956720\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), the median survival of patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) neurologic disease was less than three months in several small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, ART has altered the natural history of CMV neurologic disease, and long-term survival has been reported in some patients, even if patients initiate ART after being diagnosed with CMV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

As an example, in a systematic review of 676 patients with CMV encephalitis, 85 percent had AIDS, 12 percent had other causes of immunosuppression, and only 3 percent were immunocompetent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among individuals with AIDS, CMV neurologic disease typically presents in patients with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> the signs and symptoms depend upon the anatomic location. There have also been several cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes (IRIS) reported after initiation of potent ART, where the clinical manifestation was encephalitis and the putative antigenic stimulus was central nervous system (CNS) CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

However, delirium, confusion, and focal neurologic abnormalities are more commonly associated with CMV-related encephalitis rather than HIV-related dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Thus, individuals diagnosed with CMV neurologic disease, who are not already known to have retinitis, should undergo formal ophthalmologic screening for retinitis.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p>An MRI or contrast CT scan must be performed to exclude toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or other intracranial processes. Evidence of periventricular inflammation or meningeal enhancement helps support the diagnosis of CMV encephalitis but is not specific for the disease. In addition, case reports have demonstrated that MRI is not always sensitive to the presence of CMV encephalitis, even when it is quite severe.

In one study of 13 patients with autopsy-proven CMV infection of the brain (eg, ventriculoencephalitis), 12 had CMV DNA in the CSF compared to none of the 11 without evidence of CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-cytomegalovirus-neurologic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Myelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of CMV myelitis should be suspected in patients with advanced HIV disease who have progressive lower extremity weakness and hyperactive reflexes on neurologic examination.
