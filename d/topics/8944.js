Causes include fluid and electrolyte loss (as from gastroenteritis or osmotic diuresis), hemorrhage (as from trauma), capillary leak (as from bowel obstruction or burns), inadequate fluid intake, and insensible losses (eg, fever, tachypnea, or burns). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By definition, preload is decreased in hypovolemic shock. Systemic vascular resistance may be increased as the result of compensatory mechanisms. Cardiac contractility is typically normal.

It may occur as the result of sepsis, anaphylaxis, or neurologic injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-classification-of-shock-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Distributive shock'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With sepsis and anaphylaxis, volume depletion may also develop because of losses related to the underlying infection (septic shock), or inflammatory cascade (anaphylaxis). Both processes are associated with increased capillary permeability with loss of plasma from the intravascular space into the tissues. Myocardial dysfunction can also contribute to poor tissue perfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In septic shock, abnormal distribution of blood flow as the result of changes in vasomotor tone causes inappropriate tissue perfusion (such as decreased splanchnic circulation with increased flow to skin and muscle). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) may be low, producing increased blood flow to skin and a wide pulse pressure (warm shock) or SVR may be increased, in which case, blood flow to skin is decreased and the pulse pressure is narrow (cold shock).

Causes of obstructive shock include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumo- or hemothorax and massive pulmonary embolism. Infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart lesions, such as coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left ventricle syndrome, may also present in shock when the ductus arteriosus closes during the first few weeks of life. Conditions that cause obstructive shock must be recognized quickly because they generally require specific treatment.

Patients with distributive shock, in particular, often have multiple physiologic abnormalities. As an example, children with distributive shock from sepsis may also have volume loss (from vomiting, diarrhea, poor intake, or increased insensible fluid loss from tachypnea and fever) and myocardial depression from the effect of inflammatory mediators released in response to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
