Bradykinetic movement disorders frequently are accompanied by rigidity, postural instability, and loss of automatic associated movements. Diagnosis of the specific condition depends primarily upon careful observation of the clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Bradykinetic disorders are reviewed here. Many such disorders, mostly rare, exist and only four are discussed here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parkinson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Huntington disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation</p><p/><p>Hyperkinetic disorders are discussed separately.

The basal ganglia regulate the initiation, scaling, and control of the amplitude and direction of movement. Movement disorders can result from biochemical or structural abnormalities in these structures.</p><p>The basal ganglia are a complex of deep nuclei that consist of the corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. The corpus striatum, which includes the caudate nucleus and the putamen, receives input from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus and, in turn, projects to the globus pallidus.</p><p>The substantia nigra is divided into the dopamine-rich pars compacta and the less dense pars reticularis. The pars reticularis is similar histologically and chemically to the medial segment of the globus pallidus, and both project via the thalamus to the premotor and motor cortex. The substantia nigra pars compacta gives rise to the nigral-striatal pathway, which is the main dopaminergic tract.</p><p>The output of the basal ganglia projects by way of the thalamus to the cerebral cortex and then to the pyramidal system. Basal ganglia output is sometimes referred to as the extrapyramidal system, a term now less commonly used, because it was once thought to be in parallel with the pyramidal system. Integration of the basal ganglia with the cortex facilitates motor control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PARKINSON DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bradykinetic movement disorders are characterized by slowness of movement and consist predominantly of conditions with features of parkinsonism, of which Parkinson disease (PD) is the most prominent example (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80669 \">table 1</a>). Other characteristic motor findings of PD include tremor at rest, rigidity, and gait disturbance. In addition, nonmotor symptoms are also increasingly recognized components of PD. These include olfactory deficit, behavioral, cognitive, and sleep deficits, and dysautonomia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PD typically presents in middle and late life. However, early-onset disease can occur before age 40 years, and a juvenile form presents before age 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dystonia (often involving the legs), levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and levodopa-related motor fluctuations (eg, &quot;wearing off&quot; and &quot;on-off&quot; responses several hours following a dose) are common in the young-onset and juvenile forms of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Dystonia'</a>.)</p><p>Most cases of PD are sporadic, but genetic loci (PARK1 through PARK23) have been associated with autosomal dominant or recessive PD or parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The genetic causes of PD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of juvenile parkinsonism is based on clinical signs. Patients have gradual onset of slowness of movement, tremors in the hands or legs (but not the head), rigidity of muscles, shuffling gait, and postural instability. Other signs include lack of facial expression (hypomimia), drooling, dysarthria, and dystonia (involuntary spasms and abnormal postures of hands and feet).</p><p>Levodopa is the most effective drug in the treatment of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, most patients develop abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia) and unpredictable fluctuations in motor functioning within three years of treatment. Patients with onset before age 40 years are most likely to be affected. As a result, particularly in young patients, therapy is often initiated with other drugs that will control the symptoms and delay the need for levodopa. They include anticholinergic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trihexyphenidyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amantadine</a>) and dopamine agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complications of levodopa are managed by adjusting the dosage and frequency of administration. If these changes do not alleviate symptoms, surgical treatment, such as high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus, is considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WILSON DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wilson disease is a treatable cause of juvenile parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, and other movement disorders. This rare disorder has an estimated prevalence of 30 per million.</p><p>Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive defect of cellular copper export. The major abnormality is reduced biliary excretion of copper that leads to its accumulation, initially in the liver and then in other tissues, particularly the brain. Tissue copper deposition causes a multitude of signs and symptoms that reflect hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and renal impairment. The incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin is also impaired.</p><p>Clinical aspects of Wilson disease are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">JUVENILE ONSET HUNTINGTON DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Huntington disease (HD) typically presents during the fourth and fifth decades of life; however, onset occurs during childhood or adolescence in approximately 5 to 7 percent of affected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetics and pathogenesis of HD are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reviewed briefly, HD is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with the affected gene being on the short arm of chromosome 4. Juvenile onset disease shows a major transmitting parent effect, as approximately 80 percent of symptomatic patients inherit the mutant HD gene from their father [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The high number of cellular divisions that occur during spermatogenesis likely accounts for the pronounced paternal-repeat instability.</p><p>HD is one of a number of disorders that are associated with expansion of unstable trinucleotide (CAG) repeats that encode for polyglutamine tracts in the protein products. There is mounting evidence that fragments of the huntingtin protein containing expanded polyglutamine tracts may be neurotoxic. The greater the number of CAG repeats on expanded alleles, the earlier the age of onset and more severe the disease.</p><p>Demonstration of more than 36 CAG repeats in one of the alleles in the HD gene confirms the diagnosis of HD. Alleles with 27 to 35 CAG repeats are termed intermediate alleles. An individual with an allele in this range is not at risk of developing symptoms of HD, but may be at risk of having a child with an allele in the disease range. Juvenile forms are associated with alleles containing more than 60 to 70 repeats and, in some patients, more than 100 repeats.</p><p>The inverse relationship between age of onset and number of CAG repeats was confirmed in a Dutch cohort of 755 affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The correlation was stronger for paternal than maternal inheritance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with juvenile-onset HD develop dystonia, ataxia, and seizures. Most of them have the akinetic-rigid syndrome termed the Westphal variant. Approximately one-fourth have the classic feature of chorea seen in adults. Children also have more rapidly progressive disease than adults.</p><p>Biochemical changes observed in the brains of adults with HD may explain the neurologic features. Glutamic acid decarboxylase activity is reduced, especially in the corpus striatum, substantia nigra, and other basal ganglia. In contrast, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, neurotensin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y are increased in the corpus striatum. The depletion of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the corpus striatum may result in disinhibition of the nigral-striatal pathway. Coupled with the accumulation of somatostatin, the net result may be the release of striatal dopamine, which results in chorea.</p><p>The pattern of brain abnormality depends upon the age of onset. The characteristic pathologic change in adults with HD is diffuse, marked atrophy of the neostriatum that may be worse in the caudate than in the putamen. The changes are more dramatic in early-onset HD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Neuropathology'</a>.)</p><p>The reasons for the selective vulnerability of the medium spiny neurons in the striatum is not known, but some insight may be gained from the study of Rhes (Ras homolog enriched in striatum), a small guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is selectively localized to the striatum and to a much lesser extent in the cortex, but not in the cerebellum. Rhes binds physiologically to mutated huntingtin and leads to selective cytotoxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Rhes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No cure or disease-modifying treatment is currently available for HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Therapy is focused on symptom management and supportive care in order to optimize quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The impact of chorea in patients with HD should be carefully assessed to determine whether any specific treatment is necessary, since it may not be a debilitating or bothersome symptom, particularly in early stages. Pharmacologic treatment of chorea may worsen other aspects of HD, including parkinsonism, cognition, and mood. When chorea does become severe, padded reclining chairs and bed padding are recommended to reduce the risk of injury.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetrabenazine</a>, a dopamine depleting agent which acts by inhibiting presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) can be useful for controlling chorea in patients with HD. Compared with the typical neuroleptics, one of the advantages of tetrabenazine is that it does not cause tardive dyskinesia. However, tetrabenazine treatment was associated with significantly more adverse events than placebo treatment in randomized trials. Dose-limiting symptoms with tetrabenazine included sedation, akathisia, parkinsonism, and depressed mood; these generally resolved with dosage adjustments. Two other VMAT2 inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a> (for chorea associated with HD and for tardive dyskinesia in adults) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valbenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valbenazine</a> (for tardive dyskinesia in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Both have a longer duration of action and improved side effect profile compared with tetrabenazine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Tetrabenazine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management#H1930925221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Deutetrabenazine'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with HD who have moderately severe chorea that does not respond to nonpharmacologic intervention, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a> rather than dopamine receptor blocking drugs (neuroleptics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. For chorea that does not respond to VMAT2 inhibitors, additional treatment options include atypical and typical neuroleptics.

The diagnosis of PKAN is suspected when a MRI scan shows a central focus of increased T2 signal intensity surrounded by a zone of decreased signal in the region of the globus pallidus (eye of the tiger sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Genetic sequence analysis for PANK2 mutations is recommended by some experts to confirm the diagnosis in those with suspected NBIA and the &quot;eye of the tiger&quot; MRI sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Options include single gene testing, when clinical features point strongly a specific NBIA type, or screening by gene panel that includes multiple genes known to be associated with NBIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased iron uptake is confirmed by postmortem examination, which reveals the characteristic pigmentary degeneration of the basal ganglia, particularly the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the zona reticularis of the substantia nigra. The pigmentary changes result from marked iron accumulation in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which basal ganglia iron uptake is increased in NBIA is not well understood. Systemic and cerebrospinal fluid iron levels, as well as plasma ferritin, transferrin, and ceruloplasmin, all are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, disorders of systemic iron overload, such as hemochromatosis, are not associated with increased brain iron.</p><p>Marked neuroaxonal degeneration with the formation of ubiquinated deposits and spheroids is another distinctive pathologic feature of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These glycoprotein-containing axonal swellings have been attributed to abnormal lipid membrane peroxidation. It may result from chelation of ferrous iron caused by increased cysteine (demonstrated in one patient with NBIA), leading to the accelerated generation of free hydroxyl radicals in the presence of non-protein-bound iron.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of NBIA, including iron chelation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">deferoxamine</a> and antioxidant therapy, is ineffective.

The basal ganglia are a complex of deep nuclei that consist of the corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. These nuclei regulate the initiation, scaling, and control of the amplitude and direction of movement. Movement disorders can result from biochemical or structural abnormalities in these structures. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy of the basal ganglia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradykinetic movement disorders are characterized by slowness of movement and consist predominantly of conditions with features of parkinsonism, of which Parkinson disease is the most prominent example (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80669 \">table 1</a>). Other characteristic motor findings of Parkinson disease include tremor at rest, rigidity, and gait disturbance. Nonmotor symptoms include olfactory deficit, behavioral, cognitive, and sleep deficits, and dysautonomia. Parkinson disease typically presents in middle and late life. However, early-onset disease can occur before age 40 years, and a juvenile form presents before age 20. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Parkinson disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a treatable cause of juvenile parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, and other movement disorders. Clinical aspects of Wilson disease are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Huntington disease typically presents during the fourth and fifth decades of life; however, onset occurs during childhood or adolescence in approximately 5 to 7 percent of affected patients. Patients with juvenile-onset Huntington disease develop dystonia, ataxia, and seizures. Most of them have the akinetic-rigid syndrome termed the Westphal variant. Approximately one-fourth have the classic feature of chorea seen in adults. Children also have more rapidly progressive disease than adults. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile onset Huntington disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative syndrome that causes parkinsonism, dystonia, cognitive decline, and other neurologic deficits. NBIA is now considered a spectrum of phenotypically overlapping disorders, with several subtypes defined by differences at the molecular genetic level, including the following (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kufor-Rakeb syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuroferritinopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aceruloplasminemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>NBIA of unknown cause</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Jankovic J, Lang AE.
