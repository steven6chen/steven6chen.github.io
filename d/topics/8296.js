Graft survival was superior in sibling pairs having both the same serologically defined HLA antigens and a nonreactive in vitro mixed lymphocyte proliferative response when compared with randomly matched, deceased donors treated with the same immunosuppressive drugs, principally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. (The mixed lymphocyte response [MLR] is an in vitro estimate of incompatibility in which the degree of proliferation of the recipient lymphocytes to donor lymphocytes is measured.) There was an intermediate level of graft survival in haploidentical parent-to-child or sibling-to-sibling transplants in which one but not both of the haplotypes matched.</p><p>The most valuable databases now in existence are those representing pooling of information from a large number of collaborating centers. Although such pooled data may suffer from variations in protocols and undocumented selection factors, the power of univariate analyses becomes compelling when thousands of patients are included. These large databases include the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS), the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), the American Southeast Organ Procurement Foundation (SEOPF), the United Kingdom Transplant Service, Eurotransplant, the Australian New Zealand Data (ANZDATA), and others.</p><p>The methods used to test for HLA antigens and antibodies have changed over time and become more sophisticated. Historically, serology and cellular-based assays such as the complement-dependent cellular lymphocytotoxicity (CDC) assay were used to determine HLA antigens and anti-HLA antibodies. Antigens are now molecularly defined through DNA analysis, providing allelic-level definition of the antigens, and anti-HLA antibodies can now be detected using flow cytometry, solid-phase immunoassays, and single-antigen bead assays such as Luminex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These assays can also be used to detect non-HLA antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF HLA-A,-B, AND -DR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The simple assumption that each mismatch for HLA antigens has equal weight has not been borne out. The initial Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS) analysis showed that the major impact comes from the DR and B antigens, with little additional effect from the A antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The UK Transplant and Eurotransplant data are somewhat similar, with DR matching having a much greater effect than that of B or A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Another study found that HLA-DR mismatches (and the number of rejection episodes) correlated with poor long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Each antigen also appears to exert its effect at different times posttransplant, with the maximal effect of DR and B mismatching occurring within the first six months and two years posttransplant, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry of patients transplanted between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 2013 confirms the importance of minimizing mismatches and maximizing matches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this study of 189,141 first adult kidney-alone transplants, there was a 13 percent higher risk with one HLA mismatch (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21) and a 64 percent higher risk with six HLA mismatches (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.56-1.73), with increasing risk for each level of mismatch. In contradistinction to previous studies, these results were independent of locus.</p><p>A related issue is whether specific HLA mismatch combinations are associated with decreased renal allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A retrospective study addressed this issue by examining 2877 unrelated renal transplants with one mismatch of either HLA-A, -B, or -DR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Seven unique combinations (&quot;taboo&quot; mismatches) of recipient HLA antigen and donor HLA antigen were associated with significant decreases in graft survival when compared with survival among transplant groups with either no mismatch or one indifferent mismatch. At five years, graft survival among the groups without a mismatch, with one indifferent mismatch, or with one taboo mismatch was 72, 69, and 50 percent, respectively. The mechanism by which &quot;taboo&quot; HLA mismatches may result in diminished allograft survival is unknown.</p><p>When trying to match a donor to a recipient, avoidance of mismatches is used in preference to matching of HLA antigens. This approach maximizes the number of patients offered well-matched grafts because the same antigen may be present twice. As an example, HLA-A2 is a common antigen, and homozygosity is frequent. Such a patient can receive a graft with no mismatches; however, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> cannot be matched for six HLA antigens, since only five are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453172946\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF HLA-DP AND -DQ</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HLA-DP is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II locus. Anti-HLA-DP antibodies are less common than antibodies to HLA-DR and -DQ (occurring in 5 to 14 percent of transplant recipients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The frequency of HLA-DP antibodies increases in patients who were previously transplanted, occurring in up to 45 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. HLA-DP is constitutively expressed at low levels in renal endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although some studies have suggested that the presence of anti-HLA-DP antibodies does not reduce allograft survival among recipients of a first transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], other studies have suggested that these antibodies correlate with reduced allograft survival among recipients of a second transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>].</p><p>In one study, the estimated incidence of anti-HLA-DQ antibodies was approximately 11 percent in nonalloimmunized, normal, male, Mexican blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another study, the incidence of preformed anti-HLA-DQ antibodies in renal transplant recipients was 11 percent and increased to 36 percent posttransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this study, transplant recipients with de novo persistent DQ-only donor-specific antibody (DSA) or de novo DQ plus other DSAs had more acute rejection episodes, increased risk of allograft loss, and a lower five-year allograft survival.</p><p>In a study of 503 unsensitized kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant patients, 24 percent developed de novo DSAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Of these, 73 percent developed anti-HLA-DQ antibody. Recipients with de novo DSA were more likely to suffer an acute rejection, an antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and a recurrent acute rejection compared with de novo donor-specific-negative recipients. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the death-censored actuarial graft survival of those with de novo DSAs was worse than the DSA-free cohort. If there was no acute rejection, there was no difference in graft survival between cohorts.</p><p>DQ mismatches increase the risk of rejection. A registry study of the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDAT) registry of kidney transplant recipients transplanted between 2004 and 2012 revealed that, compared with recipients of zero&nbsp;HLA-DQ mismatched kidneys, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for rejections in recipients who had received one or two&nbsp;HLA-DQ mismatched kidneys were 1.54 (95% CI 1.08-2.19) and 2.85 (95% CI 1.05-7.75), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].&nbsp;HLA-DR was an effect modifier between&nbsp;HLA-DQ mismatches and AMR such that the association between&nbsp;HLA-DQ mismatches and AMR was statistically significant among those who have received one or two&nbsp;HLA-DR mismatched kidneys, with adjusted HR of 2.50 (95% CI 1.05-5.94).</p><p>The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has amended its policy, requiring deceased-donor HLA typing to include identification of the HLA-DQ antigens before making any kidney, kidney-pancreas, pancreas, or pancreas islet offers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Despite the above, the kidney allocation policy does not include HLA-DQ matching in the algorithms for organ allocation programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453173159\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF HLA-C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forty to 50 percent of renal transplant recipients may have preformed anti-HLA-C antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The effect of HLA-C antibodies on allograft outcome is controversial. Some studies have suggested that anti-HLA-C antibodies are associated with low levels of acute rejection, while others have shown increased antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/28,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31,32</a>]. The availability of single-antigen bead assessment of anti-HLA antibodies may add some clarity. In a retrospective, single-center study, 608 transplant patients were assessed for donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) as defined by a mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of &gt;500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of these, 160 (26 percent) had DSA, and 25 (4 percent) had anti-HLA-C antibodies. Among 22 patients who were available for follow-up, the incidence of AMR in the first year was 27 percent in those with anti-HLA-C antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF EARLY REJECTION EPISODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term graft survival may also be related to the presence or absence of early rejection episodes. Some findings suggest that early rejection increases the risk of future graft failure, which is less likely to occur with reduction in the HLA barrier.</p><p>It is of interest that the degree of mismatching per se is not directly predictive of early rejection episodes. This raises the issue of whether intrinsic responsiveness of individual patients determines to a large extent the rejection episode rate; once rejecting patients declare themselves, the HLA barrier then becomes an important determinant of graft survival rates. Alternatively, the rejection tempo may be intrinsically more powerful with a higher number of mismatched antigens.</p><p>Failure to have an early rejection episode, on the other hand, may be determined both by individual susceptibility to immunosuppressive agents and by immunogenetic factors that vary with different donor-recipient combinations. A relatively common example of the latter is the patient doing well with a second transplant after vigorous rejection of a first graft bearing different HLA antigens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM GRAFT SURVIVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most transplants that are lost to acute rejection do so within the first year. Later graft loss is primarily due to &quot;chronic rejection,&quot; a disorder that is generally unresponsive to current immunosuppressive regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic renal allograft nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple analyses have demonstrated improved survival in well-matched cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In the 2008 annual report of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), the five-year deceased, nonextended-criteria donor allograft survival for zero versus six HLA-mismatched deceased-donor kidneys was 75 and 66 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Long-term survival is also best in HLA-identical, particularly living related, kidneys and worst in randomly matched cadaver kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. As an example, a report from the same United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database evaluated more than 7600 HLA-matched (ie, no mismatches) and 81,000 HLA-mismatched cadaveric renal transplants performed between 1987 and 1999 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. HLA-matched transplants had longer allograft half-lives (12.5 versus 8.6 years) and increased 10-year survival (52 versus 37 percent). Similar findings have been reported in subsequent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The beneficial effect of HLA matching on long-term survival has come during the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> era, a period in which graft survivals and rejection rates have continued to improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The benefits of HLA matching have also continued with the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil and other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The improved long-term survival observed in well-matched HLA grafts may be less apparent in transplant recipients with a primary glomerular disease. In one report of 60 patients in whom an HLA-identical, living-related-donor transplant had been performed, allograft survival was correlated with the original renal disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among the 33 patients with an underlying glomerulonephritis, the 5-, 10-, and 20-year graft survival was 88, 70, and 63 percent, respectively; by comparison, no case of graft loss was observed among the remaining patients with nonglomerular renal disease. Recurrent disease appeared to be the principal cause of graft loss.</p><p>Despite the importance of HLA-DR matching, some seemingly well-matched kidneys are still rejected. These findings in part reflect the incomplete accuracy of routinely used tissue-typing methods.</p><p>A limitation of tissue typing is the difficulty in finding well-matched kidneys. The United States UNOS program mandates that six-antigen-matched grafts be given priority. Despite the large registered waiting list and relative ease of shipping kidneys around the country, only 13 percent of recipients of deceased-donor kidneys are well matched [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Priority shipping of organs is not limited to six-antigen-matched grafts, as zero mismatching is also given priority. This occurred following two amendments to the original ruling by UNOS; the first to allow donors and recipients that were both homozygous for one antigen to be considered phenotypically matched, and the second to allow for the shipment of zero-mismatch kidneys. With zero-mismatched kidneys, the donor does not express any antigen different from the recipient, although the recipient may have an antigen that is not expressed by the donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>From January 2009 until December 3, 2014, only patients with calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRAs) greater than 20 percent were allowed to be considered for the zero-antigen-mismatch program (UNOS). This policy was based upon the recognition that the expense of transportation and the negative effects of prolonged cold ischemia mitigated against improved short-term graft survival.</p><p>A new <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1200/optn_policies.pdf&amp;token=jgNBVRq5heGSKJUMvIxSckAi3J85133j51zxpREEp3KKILn8mtTakYhAmibr55MPryZsqMyHOv+Ly0bPcs0/kb+XfgKuJi9a6rqmoHllWDM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">kidney allocation scheme (KAS)</a> was implemented December 3, 2014 and is based on the kidney donor profile index (KDPI) and the estimated posttransplant survival (EPTS) of the patient in an effort to balance equity and utility. In accordance with the new policy, zero-antigen-matched kidneys can be given to patients with a low cPRA, but sensitized patients receive many more points under the new KAS than they used to receive under the old allocation policy.</p><p>Most of the worldwide data on deceased-donor transplantation have therefore been based upon random assignment of cases without regard to HLA incompatibility, and the importance of lesser degrees of matching has only been determined after transplantation. A strategy to increase the frequency of partially matched grafts and, therefore, of transplant survival is regional organ sharing, although the results are less dramatic compared with the six-antigen-matched cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with more than 36 hours of cold ischemia time may not benefit from HLA matching. In an analysis of the UNOS database, recipients of zero-HLA-mismatched kidneys with less than 36 hours of cold ischemia time had superior five-year graft survival than recipients with one or more mismatches (75 and 67 percent, respectively, p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, no survival advantage was observed if zero-mismatched kidneys were exposed to more than 36 hours of cold ischemia time.</p><p>Thus, if there were no cold ischemia time effects, a strategy of national allocation and shipping of all kidneys (not just zero-antigen mismatches) to minimize HLA mismatches would generate the largest graft survival improvement and cost savings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, there would be longer preservation times under a national allocation policy, and prolongation of cold ischemia time negatively affects outcome and costs. The early results of the newer KAS suggest that there is more shipping of organs, especially for highly sensitized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]<em>.</em></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conflicting evidence exists concerning the current importance of HLA matching and allograft survival:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, it was noted that the importance of HLA matching for allograft survival may have diminished over the last several years, with nonimmunologic factors assuming more relative significance. In this study, the factors underlying allograft survival over the period 1994 to 1998 were noted among over 30,000 transplant recipients of deceased-donor kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. With each successive year, ever increasing degrees of HLA mismatching were required to have a statistically significant adverse effect upon allograft failure. Thus, increased allograft failure was significantly associated with the following: three to six antigen mismatches in 1995, four to six antigen mismatches in 1996, five and six antigen mismatches in 1997, and six antigen mismatches in 1998. By comparison, peak PRA; donor age, sex, and cause of death; cold ischemia time; and donor and recipient body size retained their relative importance for allograft survival over this period. Although the reasons are unclear, the administration of increasingly better immunosuppressive regimens during this period may in part underlie these observations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study that compared the effect of HLA compatibility on allograft survival during the years 1985 to 1994, with survival between 2000 and 2004, found that HLA mismatches continued to significantly influence allograft outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Compared with three HLA mismatches, for example, the relative risk of allograft survival at five years with two HLA mismatches for the early versus the late period was 0.95 (0.92 to 0.99) and 0.93 (0.89 to 0.97), respectively. Similar findings for the two periods were noted for no to six mismatches.</p><p/><p>Despite these studies, the weight of overall evidence suggests that HLA matching still has a significant impact on allograft survival.

This was suggested by a multicenter study that compared survival of 1025 recipients of HLA-incompatible living-donor kidneys with matched, waitlisted controls who either never received a kidney or who eventually received an HLA-compatible deceased-donor kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. HLA-incompatible recipients were defined as those who underwent desensitization protocols for donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). For each recipient of a mismatched kidney, five matched, waitlisted controls who never received a transplant and five matched, waitlisted controls who eventually received a deceased-donor kidney were drawn from the SRTR waiting list. The desensitization protocol employed was defined by individual centers.</p><p>Compared with candidates on the waiting list who never received a kidney, survival was higher among recipients of HLA-mismatched kidneys at one year (89.6 versus 95 percent), three years (72.7 versus 91.7), five years (59.2 versus 86 percent), and eight years (43.9 versus 76.5 percent). Even compared with waitlisted candidates who eventually received a deceased-donor kidney, survival was higher among recipients of HLA-mismatched kidneys at one year (94 versus 95 percent), three years (83.6 versus 91.7 percent), five years, (74.4 versus 86 percent), and eight years (43.9 versus 76.5 percent).</p><p>Importantly, this survival benefit was observed at all levels of DSAs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At mild DSA levels (defined by a positive Luminex assay but negative flow cytometry crossmatch, n = 185), compared with waitlisted candidates who never received a kidney and compared with candidates who eventually received a deceased-donor kidney, survival was higher among HLA-incompatible recipients at one year (90.6 versus 94 versus 98.4 percent, respectively), three years (76.3 versus 85.2 versus 95.1 percent, respectively), five years (61.9 versus 74.6 versus 91.2 percent, respectively), and eight years (47.1 versus 65 versus 89.2 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At moderate DSA levels (defined by positive flow cytometry but negative cytotoxic crossmatch, n = 536), compared with waitlisted candidates who never received a kidney and candidates who eventually received a deceased-donor kidney, survival was higher among HLA-incompatible recipients at one year (89.7 versus 94.5 versus 96.1 percent, respectively), three years (72.1 versus 83.8 versus 93.3 percent, respectively), five years (58.4 versus 74.9 versus 87.1 percent, respectively), and eight years (43 versus 63.3 versus 76.3 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a positive cytotoxic crossmatch indicating a high DSA level (n = 304), survival at one year was similar among HLA-mismatched recipients (91.1 percent) compared with both control groups (93 and 88.9 percent).

In this study, the survival benefit persisted despite the presence of high DSA levels and independent of the desensitization protocol utilized. However, these findings came from highly effective transplant centers and may not be generalizable to all centers. Also, the comparator group was drawn from all patients on the waiting list rather than just active patients who would be considered suitable for transplantation. Drawing the matched controls from the entire waiting list may have overestimated the apparent benefit of transplantation of an HLA-incompatible kidney. Approximately one-third of patients on the waiting list are not active, and most are inactive because of health issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF DE-EMPHASIS OF HLA MATCHING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the de-emphasis of HLA matching in organ allocation may not affect short-term results, the above data show that it is likely to affect long-term results. In addition, an analysis of candidates listed in the United States from 1988 to 2007 from the Scientific Renal Transplant Registry (SRTR) database that were relisted after loss of a primary kidney transplant (n = 15,980) looked at the change in panel reactive antibody (PRA) from prior to the recipient's initial transplant to the subsequent listing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. There was no appreciable change in PRA for patients receiving a first zero HLA-A, -B, -DR, or 0 HLA-A, -B-mismatched kidney transplant. However, there was a significant increase in PRA by increasing HLA mismatch of the first transplant. Only 10 percent of patients became sensitized after a zero HLA-A, -B-mismatched transplant, whereas the proportion rose up to 37 percent with increasing HLA mismatches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HLA AND ORGAN ALLOCATION IN BLACKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the distribution of HLA antigens and frequency of deceased-donor donation differs among racial groups, thereby affecting organ allocation. Until the 2009 changes in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) organ allocation policy, 17 percent of all nonextended-criteria, deceased-donor kidneys were transplanted into zero-mismatched recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], of whom approximately 90 percent were white and only 9 percent black [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Between 1987 and 1995, black patients received only 6 percent of fully matched kidneys despite constituting approximately one-third of the national waiting list. Conversely, 30 percent of partially or fully mismatched kidneys go to black recipients, approximating the frequency with which blacks appear on the waiting list.</p><p>To address this relative inequity, the national allocation policy of the United States was changed to no longer give priority points for fewer HLA-B mismatches. This was derived in part from findings of a study that addressed the effect of eliminating HLA-B matching. Based upon a Cox model analysis in which HLA-DR but not HLA-B matching was utilized, the number of transplants was calculated to decrease by 4 percent among whites but increase by 6.3 percent in nonwhites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]; this change was determined to result only in a 2 percent increase in graft loss. By comparison, removal of both HLA-B and HLA-DR would result in an 8 percent increase in graft loss. A study modeling the impact of this policy demonstrated that it would result in a detrimental effect on Caucasian survival and overall increased costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

An alternative to allocation based upon HLA specificities is matching by HLA-A and B supertypes or cross-reactive groups (CREG) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>). However, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) no longer uses CREGs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGENS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">MICA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related chain A (MICA) is the product of an HLA-related, polymorphic gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. MICA is expressed on monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Although its exact function is unclear, MICA is recognized by a subpopulation of intestinal gamma delta T cells and may play a role in the activation of a subpopulation of natural killer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Antibodies directed against MICA may adversely affect allograft function and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>].

Compared with those without antibodies, the presence of MICA antibodies significantly lowered one-year allograft survival among all patients (88.3 versus 93 percent), recipients of first kidney transplants (87.8 versus 93.5 percent), and recipients who received well-matched kidneys (zero or one HLA-A plus HLA-B plus HLA-DR mismatch; 83.2 versus 95.1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As part of the 13<sup>th</sup> International Histocompatibility Workshop, 1329 patients with functioning transplants were prospectively tested for HLA antibodies in 2002 and followed for four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At four years, allograft survival was significantly higher among those with no identified antibodies (806 deceased-donor recipients) versus those with HLA (158 patients) or MICA antibodies (69 patients; 81 versus 58 and 72 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective trial of the 14<sup>th</sup> International Histocompatibility Workshop, one-year allograft survival of 1319 deceased-donor recipients and no HLA antibodies was 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This was significantly higher than that observed for the 344 patients with HLA antibodies (94 percent) and the 33 patients with MICA (83 percent). By comparison, 12 recipients with donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) tested by single-antigen beads had a one-year graft survival of 64 percent, and 27 patients with non-donor-specific &quot;strong&quot; antibodies had a 66 percent survival.</p><p/><p>These trials provide strong evidence that HLA and MICA antibodies are associated with graft failure after one and four years posttransplant.

We test for such antibodies in select patients with unexplained rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">H-Y antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to reactivity against Y chromosome H-Y encoded gene products, transplants from a male donor to a female recipient, particularly hematopoietic cell transplants, are reportedly associated with an increased risk of rejection. However, the role of such gene products in kidney transplantation is unclear. This was indirectly evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of nearly 200,000 recipients of deceased-donor kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Compared with all other gender combinations, an increased risk of allograft failure was noted in female recipients of male donor kidneys at one year (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.14) and between 2 and 10 years (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10). These findings suggest that there may be an association between adverse effects and H-Y encoded products. Further studies are required to better understand this possible association.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPOSURE TO NONINHERITED HLA ALLELES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In utero and while nursing, infants are exposed to maternal antigens that the child has not inherited. There is evidence that such exposure may result in some degree of tolerance. One study of 205 patients evaluated the long-term survival of kidney allografts transplanted from siblings with maternal or paternal HLA alleles not inherited by the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Compared with the kidneys donated from siblings with paternal alleles not inherited by the recipient, a higher incidence of survival was significantly observed among the allografts donated from siblings with noninherited maternal alleles at both 5 and 10 years (86 versus 67 percent and 77 versus 49 percent, respectively). Although many unrecognized factors may be confounding, these results suggest that exposure to donor antigens prior to transplantation may help induce some degree of tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16468305\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antigens of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system are a major barrier to long-term engraftment.
