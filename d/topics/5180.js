Data on the use of these therapies in children are limited as described below (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulant agents'</a> below).</p><p>Despite the lack of definitive data, LMWH is generally preferred over UFH in most circumstances, for the reasons summarized in the table detailed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114581 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2910797921\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of LMWH'</a> below). LMWH also is generally preferred over VKA because the response to VKAs in children tends to be unpredictable and requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. Nonetheless, VKA may be preferred by patients requiring long-term therapy because they are administered orally. Other anticoagulants (eg, factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors) are rarely used in children. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Other anticoagulants'</a> below.)</p><p>Thrombolytic agents (eg, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [tPA], urokinase) are used only in selected patients with major vessel occlusion causing compromise of organs or limbs. (See <a href=\"#H1766255707\" class=\"local\">'Major vessel occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p>The following suggestions are based on the available evidence, expert opinion, and clinical experience. The approach to treatment of VTE in children is largely extrapolated from adult guidelines.

Of these risk factors, the most common is an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Other risk factors include surgery, trauma, infection, immobilization, malignancy, use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), inflammatory conditions (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), structural venous abnormalities, and inherited thrombophilia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59759 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

LMWH is generally preferred for the reasons summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114581 \">table 1</a>). However, UFH may be preferred for initial therapy in some circumstances, such as in patients with renal failure or those with bleeding risks who require finely tuned titration and the ability to quickly turn on or off the infusion (eg, patients requiring multiple surgeries or other invasive procedures).</p><p>If VKA is used, the treatment should overlap with <span class=\"nowrap\">UFH/LMWH</span> until the international normalized ratio (INR) is in the therapeutic range (ie, 2.0 to 3.0) on two consecutive days. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin K antagonists'</a> below.)</p><p>Special considerations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> modifications of this regimen are warranted in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CVC-related VTE</strong> &ndash; In addition to standard anticoagulation therapy (as described above), the CVC should be removed after three to five days of treatment if clinically feasible. If the CVC is required and still functioning, prophylactic doses of LMWH should be given to prevent recurrent VTE following therapeutic anticoagulation until the CVC is removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In children with ongoing but potentially reversible risk factors (eg, nephrotic syndrome or Kawasaki disease), anticoagulant therapy is extended beyond three months until the risk factor has resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management of a blocked CVC without a definite thrombus typically involves instilling recombinant tPA into the lumen of the catheter as described below (see <a href=\"#H1930689380\" class=\"local\">'Blocked CVC'</a> below). Otherwise, thrombolytic therapy is generally not necessary in the management of CVC-related VTE; its use is limited to major vessel occlusion causing compromise of organs or limbs. (See <a href=\"#H1766255707\" class=\"local\">'Major vessel occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> &ndash; Management of thromboembolism in children with cancer requires special consideration because these patients typically have CVCs, are undergoing treatment with drugs that may affect anticoagulation decisions, and often need surgical procedures. The evaluation and management of these VTE in children with cancer is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thromboembolism in children with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients using estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)</strong> &ndash; Provoked VTE in young women using estrogen-containing OCPs is treated in a similar manner as VTE due to other causes (ie, three months of anticoagulation therapy). The additional consideration in this patient population is how to best manage ongoing OCP use during anticoagulation therapy. Though the optimal practice has not been established, we favor changing to a progesterone-only oral contraceptive or implant or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD), which is not associated with VTE and also reduces uterine bleeding. Others prefer to discontinue OCPs during antithrombotic therapy, to minimize the risk for recurrent VTE. However, this practice may also exacerbate heavy, prolonged, or irregular menstrual bleeding, which is common in women using anticoagulant medications. If OCPs are discontinued in patients who are sexually active, counselling should be provided on alternative methods of birth control, and those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a> should be advised of the risk of birth defects should pregnancy occur. The risks of continuing an estrogen-containing OCP during antithrombotic therapy are not established, but are probably low. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding#H3267368063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulant therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</strong> &ndash; Episodes of VTE in children with SLE are treated in similar manner as VTE due to other causes; however, some children may require prolonged or even life-long anticoagulant therapy. The duration of therapy depends upon the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and, to a lesser extent, the location of the thrombus. The most common approach in children with a first VTE is indefinite anticoagulant therapy as long as aPL are present. In children with recurrent VTE and aPL, life-long anticoagulant therapy is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis#H75095071\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Treatment, complications, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Hematologic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of lupus anticoagulants in plasma may interfere with the coagulation tests used to monitor heparin and VKA. If lupus anticoagulants interfere with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), either an insensitive aPTT reagent or a heparin assay should be used to monitor heparin therapy. If the lupus anticoagulants interfere with the prothrombin time, plasma concentration of prothrombin can be used to monitor VKA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4286747189\"><span class=\"h2\">Unprovoked VTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VTE is considered unprovoked if there is no identifiable disorder or risk factor (including CVC) that predisposes the patient to thrombosis. Unprovoked thrombosis in children is rare. Treatment of unprovoked VTE is similar to that of provoked VTE (see <a href=\"#H2531446029\" class=\"local\">'Provoked VTE'</a> above), except the duration of treatment is longer (6 to 12 months rather than 3 months). Children with recurrent unprovoked VTE are treated indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition, children with unprovoked VTE should be screened for inherited thrombophilias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91835 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88804 \">table 4</a>).

Some patients may require a longer or shorter duration of therapy. Some experts suggest that a low-dose infusion of recombinant tPA (0.01 to 0.06 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour for up to 96 hours) may have a decreased incidence of major bleeding and can be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3912639791\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of VTE in children depends on the type of the thrombosis (see <a href=\"#H1479721050\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most children with provoked VTE (ie, due to identifiable underlying conditions and risk factors), we suggest anticoagulation therapy for three months, rather than observation or shorter courses of treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For children with central venous catheter (CVC)-associated VTE, the CVC should be removed after three to five days of anticoagulation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2531446029\" class=\"local\">'Provoked VTE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with unprovoked VTE, we suggest anticoagulation therapy for 6 to 12 months rather than a shorter course of treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Children with recurrent unprovoked VTE are treated indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H4286747189\" class=\"local\">'Unprovoked VTE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When a CVC is blocked but no definite thrombus is identified, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alteplase</a>) may be used to lyse intraluminal thrombus and restore catheter patency; it is administered as a dwell into the catheter. Lower doses of the thrombolytic agent are used for this purpose as compared with systemic thrombolysis. (See <a href=\"#H1930689380\" class=\"local\">'Blocked CVC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with pulmonary embolism (PE), we suggest anticoagulation therapy for at least three months if the PE was provoked, or six months if unprovoked (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The decision to use thrombolytic agents (eg, tPA or urokinase) should be individualized and considered only in children with extensive and hemodynamically compromising PE. (See <a href=\"#H786234460\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary embolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with major vessel occlusion causing compromise of organs or limbs, systemic or catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy may be warranted. Data on the efficacy, dose, and safety of thrombolytic agents in pediatric patients are limited and indications for thrombolytic therapy are highly individualized. (See <a href=\"#H1766255707\" class=\"local\">'Major vessel occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with VTE, we suggest low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) for anticoagulant therapy in most circumstances (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is because LMWH has a more predictable anticoagulant response, requires less monitoring and dose adjustment, and can be administered subcutaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114581 \">table 1</a>). LMWH also is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a>) in most circumstances because the response to VKAs in children tends to be unpredictable and requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. Nonetheless, VKA may be preferred by patients requiring long-term therapy because they are administered orally. (See <a href=\"#H3912639791\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2910797921\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of LMWH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LMWH dosing is based on age and body weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64075 \">table 5</a>), and the dose is titrated to achieve anti-factor Xa activity levels between 0.5 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H22597475\" class=\"local\">'Low molecular weight heparin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for VTE prophylaxis in children without a prior episode of VTE are not well-established. Important considerations include the number and nature of risk factors for VTE and whether the risk factors are transient or chronic. For hospitalized patients who are acutely ill or recovering from surgery, the use of mechanical methods for VTE risk reduction (eg, compression stockings intermittent pneumatic compression devices) is encouraged if there are risk factors for VTE (eg, immobility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> critical illness). Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy with LMWH is limited to children who have <strong>multiple</strong> risk factors for VTE. Chronic prophylactic antithrombotic therapy (typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a>) may be warranted for patients who have considerable long-lasting risk of VTE. (See <a href=\"#H1979955909\" class=\"local\">'Primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term complications of VTE in children include recurrent VTE and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). PTS is characterized by chronic venous insufficiency, with symptoms varying from mild edema to chronic pain and ulceration of the affected limb. The risk of mortality as a direct result of thrombotic complications is approximately 2 to 4 percent. The majority of VTE-related deaths are due to PE.
