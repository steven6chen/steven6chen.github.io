This is usually due to the presence of multiple pathogenic factors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>). The hyperkalemia is usually related at least in part to the presence of diabetic nephropathy. When it occurs at a level of renal function at which hyperkalemia is otherwise uncommon (ie, a serum creatinine level of 1.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or with concurrent hyperglycemia, additional explanations must be considered.</p><p>The frequent occurrence of hyperkalemia in diabetes can lead to complacency in its evaluation and management. Every episode should be addressed, with the attention given to hyperkalemia in other settings because of the risks of cardiac conduction and rhythm disturbances and death.</p><p>Commonly, the patient has hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, an entity that occurs most often in patients over the age of 50 years who have diabetic nephropathy, chronic interstitial nephritis, or occasionally another renal disorder with mild to moderate renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-15-a-74-year-old-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-and-recurrent-hyperkalemia-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While the plasma renin activity is usually low, this is not always the case, possibly due to an adrenocortical defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-15-a-74-year-old-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-and-recurrent-hyperkalemia-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The serum aldosterone concentration is inappropriately low. As in other circumstances where hypoaldosteronism is present, Addison's disease should be considered before an isolated deficiency of aldosterone is diagnosed.</p><p>Addison's disease must always be considered in a patient with hyperkalemia. Sometimes this can be excluded on clinical grounds (eg, when the patient is hypertensive and especially when the patient is hypertensive on antihypertensive medications). Other factors that make Addison's disease unlikely are the absence of anorexia and a normal serum sodium level. In the present patient, who had the characteristic profile of a patient with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and no other findings suggestive of Addison's disease, testing was not necessary. When in doubt, a cosyntropin stimulation test should be performed.</p><p>The diagnosis of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism may be established by obtaining simultaneous measurements of plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone after administration of a loop diuretic or three hours in the upright position. This is sometimes difficult in diabetic patients. Often, it is difficult or impossible for the patient to remain upright for three hours. The blood sample for plasma renin activity must be collected in a special tube and kept on ice. The plasma renin activity is not always low in diabetics with this condition. In practice, in a diabetic patient with renal insufficiency in whom other causes of hyperkalemia have been excluded by the history, the diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds and confirmed by a trial of therapy.</p><p>Unfortunately, hyperkalemia can be precipitated or exacerbated by many medications that are often indicated in diabetes for cardiovascular, renal, or other reasons. The most common agents that are implicated are those that further impair the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>). Additional causes include other potassium-sparing diuretics (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a>), digitalis and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperglycemia-induced hyperkalemia is a common and underappreciated problem in diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-15-a-74-year-old-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-and-recurrent-hyperkalemia-comment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This is related to the hyperosmolar effect of hyperglycemia and to insulin deficiency. It often occurs in patients who are otherwise predisposed to hyperkalemia because of renal insufficiency, hypoaldosteronism, medications, volume depletion, or other causes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>). It is rapidly responsive to the administration of insulin.</p><p>The pathogenesis of this disorder is as follows. Hyperosmolality causes translocation of potassium from the intracellular fluid to the extracellular fluid, raising the circulating potassium level. In diabetic patients with nephropathy, insulin and aldosterone are often both deficient. Insulin promotes entry of potassium into cells in the liver and other organs. It is part of the body's hormonal defenses against hyperkalemia, along with aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-15-a-74-year-old-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-and-recurrent-hyperkalemia-comment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When insulin and aldosterone are both deficient, the patient is unable to defend against the hyperkalemia induced by hyperglycemia and its attendant hyperosmolality.</p><p>The patient described in this case was predisposed to hyperkalemia because of renal insufficiency. She experienced an episode of hyperglycemia-induced hyperkalemia that responded well to insulin. She then had an episode of hyperkalemia due to the combined use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker that responded to cessation of these agents, otherwise indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria. Later, she developed hyperkalemia without these precipitants. The diagnosis of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (type 4 renal tubular acidosis [RTA]) was made on a clinical basis in a patient with long-standing diabetes and renal insufficiency who therefore had the common profile of patients with this condition. She responded well to mineralocorticoid replacement therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>. Unexpectedly, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine improved on this treatment, indicating that the patient had been volume depleted due to aldosterone deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Why was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> not started earlier in this patient? The patient's initial episodes of hyperkalemia responded well to correction of hyperglycemia, to removal of offending medications, and to a low potassium diet. While hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism may have been present at those times, it may also have developed or progressed subsequently. Fludrocortisone is not without its risks, including hypokalemia, fluid retention, and congestive heart failure. The dose should not exceed 0.2 mg a day; usually doses of 0.05 or 0.1 mg a day are sufficient.</p><p>One cannot overstate the importance of a low potassium diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53492 \">table 1</a>). It is important to review all potential food sources of potassium and to provide alternative dietary suggestions that are low in potassium. The elimination of orange juice, bananas, and dried fruits may not be sufficient.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-15-a-74-year-old-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-and-recurrent-hyperkalemia-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">DeFronzo RA.
