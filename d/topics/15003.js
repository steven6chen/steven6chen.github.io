However, individual older patients who have significant comorbidities may not live long enough to realize the benefits of transplantation, which are not observed until a number of months to years after transplantation. It is important to carefully evaluate older patients who are being considered for renal transplantation in order to avoid subjecting the patient to an invasive procedure from which he or she will not benefit and to avoid wasting a kidney that could provide years of benefit to another recipient.</p><p>This topic reviews issues surrounding renal transplantation among older adults.</p><p>The evaluation of potential kidney transplant donors and recipients, the kidney transplant waiting list, and the allocation of deceased-donor kidneys are discussed elsewhere.

Sixty percent of patients who enter end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are &ge;60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The percentage of candidates &gt;50 years on the transplant waiting list increased from 53 to 64 percent between 2003 and 2013, with a corresponding decrease in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive evaluation of the prospective older transplant recipient includes the identification of significant comorbid disease that may preclude transplantation.

While cognitive impairment does not necessarily preclude transplantation, significant deficits increase the risk of poor outcomes and also require the provision of strong social support both before and after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A screening tool may help identify suitable candidates for transplantation, although these are not widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In general, the specific agents are the same as for younger recipients.</p><p>We start with the same induction and maintenance immunosuppression regimen for older recipients as for younger recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As for all recipients, we modify the regimen in individual recipients based upon their response to therapy, including the development of adverse side effects, such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, infection, or malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. We find that such modifications are far more common among older recipients compared with younger individuals; in our center, 60 percent of recipients older than 60 years end up being treated after induction with a calcineurin inhibitor and low-dose glucocorticoids (thus without an antimetabolite such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>).</p><p>Some centers modify the regimen from the outset to decrease net immunosuppression. The rationale for this includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively decreased immunocompetence in older adults provides a rationale both for and against altering the immunosuppressive regimen. Decreased immunocompetence may decrease the risk of acute rejection, as is suggested by some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the differential rates of acute rejection in older versus younger patients has been attenuated in more recent years due to an overall decline in the risk of rejection with improved immunosuppression. An additional consideration is that preventing acute rejection is critically important in older recipients because it may have a greater impact on long-term graft survival in older as compared with younger recipients. Similarly, on the one hand, decreased immunocompetence may increase the risk of infection, the most common cause of death, and, thus, graft loss among older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor kidneys that are transplanted into older adults tend to be from older donors and thus may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of immunosuppressive medications, such as calcineurin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H179865586\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacokinetics of drugs, particularly calcineurin inhibitors, may also be altered in older adults. Initial calcineurin inhibitor doses that are similar to those recommended for younger patients may result in higher blood concentrations among older recipients because of a decline in cytochrome P450 activity.</p><p/><p>Our induction and maintenance regimens are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H179865586\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer induction therapy to most older recipients. However, in some centers, induction therapy with antibodies is not administered to older individuals, given the theoretically lower risk of acute rejection. One reason that we use induction therapy is to allow modification of maintenance therapy, if necessary, including reduction in the target <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> trough concentration and discontinuation of the antimetabolite.</p><p>The optimal induction regimen for older patients is not known. Approaches are center specific and based upon expert opinion rather than published data. Our approach to older patients is the same as for younger patients. As for younger recipients, we do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG) to Caucasian recipients of two-haplotype-identical, living, related kidneys, because such patients are very low risk for acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In some centers, such patients are treated with an anti-interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antibody, however. Similarly, we do not give rATG to patients who are unable to tolerate rATG (such as those presenting for transplant with hypotension, leucopenia, or thrombocytopenia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While our choice of agent is largely based upon studies in younger individuals, retrospective analyses of data from older individuals have also suggested better outcomes among those who received rATG rather than anti-IL-2 receptor antibody or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data from 2003 to 2008, among high-risk older (&gt;60 years) recipients who received high-risk kidneys, those who received rATG had the lowest cumulative rate of acute rejection within the first year after transplantation compared with those who received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Compared with rATG, the adjusted odds of acute rejection at one year for anti-IL-2 receptor antibody was 1.65 (95% CI 1.45-1.89) and for alemtuzumab was 1.35 (95% CI 1.08-1.69).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There was no difference between groups in death-censored graft survival, but, compared with rATG, there was an increased risk of death among recipients of anti-IL-2 receptor antibody (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). Compared with rATG, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> was associated with an increased risk of death-censored graft loss (adjusted HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.34-1.92) and death (adjusted HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.53).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A high-risk recipient was defined as one having a peak panel reactive antibody &gt;20 percent or a prior kidney transplantation or of black race. High-risk donor kidneys included expanded-criteria-donor kidneys, kidneys following cardiac death, or kidneys having a cold ischemia time &gt;24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation#H26252320\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;, section on 'Kidney donor profile index (KDPI)'</a>.)<br/><br/>There did not appear to be any difference in outcomes by treatment among low-risk older patients who received low-risk kidneys, although there was a higher risk of rejection if either the recipient or donor was high risk. (See <a href=\"#H210252233\" class=\"local\">'Source of donor kidney'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another registry study that did not distinguish risk of rejection by recipient or donor included 14,907 patients aged &ge;65 years who were transplanted from January 2000 to July 2009 and followed through 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Acute rejection rates were lowest with rATG (5 percent) compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> (7 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> (7 percent).

However, such regimens, as well as those associated with the withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors, have been associated with an increased incidence of acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

The specific agents are the same as for younger recipients, although the regimen is commonly modified in older recipients because of decreased immunocompetency or increased side effects. (See <a href=\"#H210251620\" class=\"local\">'Considerations in older adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For induction, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG), rather than an interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, to most older patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Exceptions include those who cannot tolerate rATG and Caucasian recipients of two-haplotype-identical, living, related kidneys because such patients are very low risk for acute rejection. In some centers, such patients are treated with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody; however, in other centers, induction therapy with antibodies is not administered, given the decreased risk of acute rejection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> above.)<br/><br/>For recipients who have another functioning solid organ transplant and are already on immunosuppressive agents, some clinicians give anti-IL-2 receptor antibody, whereas others give rATG. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy for older adult recipients consists of triple immunosuppression therapy, similar to the approach for younger patients. This includes an antimetabolite (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>), a calcineurin inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.
