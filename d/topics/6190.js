The term &quot;miliary&quot; was coined in 1700 by John Jacobus Manget, who likened the appearance of the involved lung with its surface covered with firm small white nodules to numerous millet seeds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76174 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Miliary TB can arise as a result of progressive primary infection or via reactivation of a latent focus with subsequent spread. The term miliary TB was originally a pathologic and then a radiographic description; it is now used more broadly (and incorrectly) by some to denote all forms of progressive, widely disseminated TB, whether or not disease presents with the classic radiographic or pathologic nodular appearance characteristic of hematogenous spread.</p><p>Tuberculosis may be classified according to site of disease as pulmonary or extrapulmonary; miliary disease has been classified as both an extrapulmonary and a pulmonary form of TB.</p><p>The epidemiology and pathology of miliary TB will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of miliary TB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of miliary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7622732\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of miliary tuberculosis (TB) has been altered by use of chemotherapy for treatment of malignancy, use of biologic agents, the HIV epidemic, and immigration patterns. For reporting purposes, cases with both pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease are classified as pulmonary TB by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Of 9272 TB cases reported in the United States in 2016, extrapulmonary TB (with no demonstrated pulmonary involvement) accounted for approximately 20 percent of cases.

By the 1970s, with the availability of antituberculous therapy, the incidence had fallen to 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the CDC in the early 1980s (after the availability of antituberculous therapy but prior to the HIV epidemic) reported 1.3 percent of TB cases had evidence of miliary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the midst of the HIV epidemic during the mid-1980s, the percentage of miliary TB was higher among HIV-infected patients than HIV-uninfected patients (38 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Risk for developing miliary TB appeared to be highest among patients with the lowest CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a public health clinic in Ireland in the 1990s, miliary disease accounted for 4 percent of TB cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Use of biologic agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors has been associated with a disproportionate increase in cases of extrapulmonary and miliary tuberculosis among individuals treated with these agents. In one study including 70 patients who developed tuberculosis in association with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> therapy, extrapulmonary disease was observed in 57 percent of cases, and &quot;disseminated&quot; disease was observed in 24 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another study including 40 patients who developed TB in association with anti-TNF-alpha agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, infliximab, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>), extrapulmonary TB (including miliary TB) was observed in 62 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The HIV epidemic has played a significant role in increasing the prevalence of miliary TB. Between 1999 and 2006 in England and Wales, an almost fivefold increase in the number of miliary cases was observed (38 to 180 cases); HIV coinfection was most strongly associated with miliary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other factors, such as the emergence of drug-resistant or multidrug-resistant strains, have also contributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7622739\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of miliary TB include age and underlying medical conditions, especially HIV infection and other immunosuppression.

In another series from South Africa, miliary TB accounted for more hospital admissions among children than adults (8 versus 1 percent); 52 percent of cases occurred in children &lt;1 year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Miliary TB has been described more frequently among older adults in the post-antibiotic era than the pre-antibiotic era; this group is likely at increased risk due to relative waning of cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

There is a predilection for spread to the most vascular organs, such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain. These distant foci usually heal by granulomatous containment over weeks to months; individual lesions harbor viable organisms. Failure of these foci to heal early following primary infection leads to progressive primary disease at these sites.

These terms can be confusing because there is considerable overlap among the categories and the terminology is no longer frequently used. Acute miliary TB is primarily a clinical term; this entity can be seen in the immediate post-primary period or in immunocompromised children or adults. It is usually observed within the first two to six months following exposure, although progression may be more rapid in neonates and children under the age of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. During one TB outbreak in an HIV housing facility in San Francisco, 11 of 30 HIV-infected residents (37 percent) who were exposed to an infectious pulmonary case of TB developed TB disease within 106 days; in one HIV-infected contact, TB was diagnosed within four weeks of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7623214\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute miliary tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute (generalized) miliary TB has a relatively rapid clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/4,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,37</a>]. Prior to the availability of effective chemotherapy for TB, most cases of acute miliary TB resulted from progressive primary disease. The pathologic hallmark of acute miliary TB is a caseating granulomatous reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93762\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93762 \">picture 2</a>), with a smaller number of organisms than other forms of miliary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/4,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7623221\"><span class=\"h3\">Late generalized tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late generalized TB refers to hematogenous spread that occurs after the primary or post-primary period. In one autopsy series of 100 patients with late generalized TB from 1937 to 1959, patients had relatively chronic, clinically nonspecific presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this study, late generalized TB was frequently associated with chronic pulmonary TB. Since the availability of chemotherapy for TB, however, foci responsible for hematogenous spread are extrapulmonary in some cases and are thus more difficult to detect.</p><p>A subset of late generalized TB is labeled cryptic miliary TB. This term refers to patients in whom the illness is even more indolent and who may demonstrate an attenuated histologic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7623228\"><span class=\"h3\">Anergic tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anergic TB is defined histologically by the absence of granulomata. In some cases, microabscesses containing large numbers of bacilli with a predominantly neutrophilic response are observed, although, in general, anergic TB is relatively difficult to establish based on histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Tissue stains and cultures are generally used for diagnosis.</p><p>Anergic (nonreactive) TB is a relatively uncommon form of miliary disease. The clinical spectrum ranges from overwhelming sepsis to nonspecific or typhoidal presentations. Most of the described cases are older patients with presumed reactivation TB. Granulomas in immunocompromised patients with TB may share similar characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Host and pathogen factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major determinants of TB dissemination include mycobacterial virulence factors and host immune defenses; these are not well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The high susceptibility of infants to miliary TB has led some investigators to speculate that the developing immune system may lack critical elements for initiating protective cellular immune responses to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. After initial infection, the development of specific cell-mediated (Type IV) immunity appears to be critical in limiting disseminated disease. Cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 12 and interferon-gamma, are essential for granuloma development and protective immunity to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].
