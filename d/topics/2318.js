Initial pharmacologic therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmia prevention has been tried in the Brugada syndrome with relatively little success, so ICD implantation should be the first line therapy for nearly all patients. However, patients with the Brugada syndrome who experience recurrent ventricular arrhythmias resulting in ICD shocks may require therapy with an antiarrhythmic drug in an effort to reduce the frequency of ICD shocks. </p><p>We approach treatment of patients with the sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS, also called sudden unexpected death syndrome or SUDS) in an identical fashion as patients with Brugada syndrome.

One exception to this is patients with a strong family history of sudden cardiac arrest; such patients who undergo risk stratification with an invasive electrophysiology study and are deemed to be at high risk of SCD may be candidates for an ICD, as discussed in a 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">HRS/EHRA/APHRS</span> expert consensus statement, though this approach remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3133740862\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H388075635\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with the Brugada syndrome who have survived sudden cardiac arrest or those with a history of syncope that is felt to be due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, we recommend implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) rather than antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

Two small series of patients with Brugada syndrome (9 and 14 patients, respectively) who underwent radiofrequency ablation reported the normalization of the Brugada ECG pattern and no further ventricular arrhythmias over a relatively short period of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Prior to expanding the role of catheter ablation in patients with Brugada syndrome, additional larger studies with longer follow-up are required. However, radiofrequency ablation may be an option for patients with a significant arrhythmic burden in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have failed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3115236241\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because patients with the Brugada syndrome who require ICD therapy are frequently relatively young, there are concerns regarding the long-term risk of ICD-related complications in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>]. Among a cohort of 378 patients with the Brugada syndrome (mean age 46 years, 82 percent male) who received an ICD and were followed for an average of 77 months, 37 percent experienced an inappropriate shock and 29 percent had a lead complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This highlights the importance of risk-benefit analysis and informed discussion with the patient prior to ICD placement, particularly for patients felt to be a low risk or for those who remain asymptomatic. In these patients, therapy with a subcutaneous ICD system may reduce the risk of lead complications, though this has not been studied in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616340609\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients with the Brugada ECG pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with the Brugada ECG pattern who are otherwise asymptomatic and have none of the criteria which would suggest Brugada syndrome (ie, no personal history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias or syncope suspected to be arrhythmic in origin, and no family history of sudden cardiac death or type 1 Brugada ECG pattern), we recommend no treatment. This recommendation, which is consistent with the 2017 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC/HRS</span> guidelines, is based on the relatively low incidence of sudden cardiac death or ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with only a Brugada pattern ECG, as well as the relatively high morbidity associated with ICD implantation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Additionally, there are no randomized trials comparing ICDs with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (or no drug therapy) in asymptomatic patients with Brugada pattern ECGs.</p><p>While there are no randomized trials of therapies in asymptomatic patients with Brugada pattern ECGs, there are some data evaluating the use of an ICD or antiarrhythmic drugs in asymptomatic patients with a Brugada pattern ECG. In one series of 378 patients with type 1 Brugada ECG findings (spontaneous in 60 percent, inducible in 40 percent), which included 166 asymptomatic patients who received an ICD on the basis of an abnormal invasive electrophysiology study (139 patients) or a family history of SCD or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (24 patients), appropriate device therapy at 10 years occurred in 12 percent of asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The clinical history should carefully screen for any prior episodes of syncope, and the 12-lead ECG should be carefully scrutinized for findings characteristic of the Brugada ECG pattern. While provocative pharmacologic testing and genetic testing are available, we do not proceed with these tests as part of the screening process for the majority of patients. Because of relatively limited data regarding the best approach to screening in such patients, recommendations for screening in this setting are primarily based on expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/12,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29</a>].

Additionally, the clinical relevance of screening asymptomatic family members without known arrhythmias was called into question by a study of 2022 patients who underwent DNA sequencing including SCN5A and KCNH2 genes, among whom 63 persons were felt to have a potentially pathogenic mutation; there was no significant difference between patients with and without potentially pathogenic mutations in the frequency of arrhythmia diagnosis (17 versus 13 percent) or in the corrected QT interval (median 429 versus 439 milliseconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, there are situations in which genetic testing of the proband patient may allow for more efficient screening of family members (eg, large numbers of first-degree relatives), in which case we consider proceeding with the genetic testing as an adjunct to the clinical and serial ECG screening. This strategy would involve testing the proband, then performing targeted genetic testing of family members only if testing of the proband is positive for a known associated mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3377105777\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive screening results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening may identify patients with both symptomatic Brugada syndrome as well as asymptomatic Brugada pattern ECGs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree relatives with a history of syncope of suspected arrhythmic origin and a Brugada type I ECG meet the criteria for the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome and should be managed accordingly.

First-degree relatives with indeterminate screening should also be considered for provocative testing with a pharmacologic challenge. A negative drug challenge has a specificity of 94 percent and negative predictive value of 83 percent in a similar population, and therefore a negative test makes Brugada syndrome unlikely, and ongoing screening is not mandatory in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brugada-syndrome-prognosis-management-and-approach-to-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
