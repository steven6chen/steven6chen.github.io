The negative impact of GMH-IVH on neurodevelopmental outcome is due not only to the direct consequences of GMH-IVH, but also to associated lesions including posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) and white matter injury (WMI).</p><p>The prevention, management, complications, and outcome of GMH-IVH in the preterm infant are discussed in this topic review.
