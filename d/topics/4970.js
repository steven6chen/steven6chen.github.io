Affected patients typically develop intensely pruritic inflammatory papules and vesicles on the forearms, knees, scalp, or buttocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86749%7EDERM%2F86750%7EDERM%2F86751%7EDERM%2F86752%7EDERM%2F86768%7EDERM%2F78315%7EDERM%2F86769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86749 graphicRef86750 graphicRef86751 graphicRef86752 graphicRef86768 graphicRef78315 graphicRef86769 \">picture 1A-G</a>). The vast majority of patients with DH also have an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease). In most of these patients, the enteropathy is asymptomatic.</p><p>DH usually responds well to treatment. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a> and a gluten-free diet are the primary interventions for the management of this disease.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of DH will be discussed here. Celiac disease is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23341172\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DH is an uncommon disorder that most frequently occurs in individuals of northern European heritage. Epidemiologic studies from northern Europe have found incidence rates between 0.4 and 3.5 per 100,000 people per year and prevalence rates between 1.2 and 75.3 per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. A population-based study in Utah, a location with a relatively high proportion of individuals with northern European ancestry, found incidence and prevalence rates similar to those reported in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Between 1978 and 1987, the incidence of DH was 0.98 per 100,000 people per year, and the prevalence of DH in 1987 was 11.2 per 100,000 people.</p><p>The incidence of DH may be decreasing. An analysis of patient data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the United Kingdom found a decline in incidence from 1.82 per 100,000 person-years in 1990 to 0.8 per 100,000 person-years in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A Finnish study that compared the incidence of DH diagnosed within a university hospital district in three successive decades, beginning in 1970, also found decreasing rates of DH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The estimated annual incidence for each decade was 5.2, 2.9, and 2.7 per 100,000 people, respectively. The reason for the observed decline in DH incidence has not been confirmed. Increased detection and treatment of mild celiac disease is a potential contributor. (See <a href=\"#H23341179\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have found that males are more likely to develop DH than females; reported male to female ratios have ranged from 1.1:1 to 1.9:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reason for a male predominance in DH is unknown.</p><p>Although the mean age of disease onset is often reported to be in the fourth or fifth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], individuals of all ages may be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. DH is uncommon in children. In the Finnish study mentioned above, only 18 of 477 patients with DH were children (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23341179\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of DH appears to be complex, involving both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Like celiac disease, DH is considered a manifestation of gluten-sensitivity that is most likely to occur in genetically susceptible individuals. The importance of gluten in the pathogenesis of these disorders is supported by the observation that the elimination of dietary gluten results in the remission of both diseases. (See <a href=\"#H2261977249\" class=\"local\">'Gluten-free diet'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Histologic examination of skin biopsy specimens supports an important role for the immune system in DH. Subepidermal deposition of IgA and neutrophilic dermal infiltrates in the superficial dermis are characteristic findings of this disease. (See <a href=\"#H23341348\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016766306\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes predispose to the development of DH. Virtually all patients with DH carry the HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8 haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This concept was evident in a comparative study of 50 subjects with DH and 290 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The study found that genes encoding HLA DQ2 were carried by 86 percent of the patients with DH, compared with only 25 percent of the healthy controls. In addition, six of the seven patients with DH who were negative for HLA DQ2 were positive for HLA DQ8. The importance of HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 is likely related to their role in the promotion of an immune response against gliadin peptides (see <a href=\"#H2016766164\" class=\"local\">'Gluten sensitivity'</a> below). Non-HLA genetic factors may also influence the risk of developing DH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>A genetic contribution to DH is supported further by familial studies that demonstrate that first-degree relatives of patients with DH have an increased risk for both DH and celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In a Finnish cohort of over 1000 patients with DH, 4 percent reported that they had a first-degree relative with DH, and 6 percent reported that they had a first-degree relative with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016766164\"><span class=\"h2\">Gluten sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strong epidemiologic link between DH and celiac disease strongly supports a shared pathogenesis involving gluten-sensitivity. More than 90 percent of patients with DH exhibit small bowel biopsy findings consistent with some degree of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both the adaptive and innate immune systems may contribute to the development of the clinical manifestations of gluten-sensitivity. Gliadin peptides (peptides derived from the digestion of gluten) and tissue transglutaminase (a calcium-dependent enzyme that catalyzes crosslinks between glutamine and lysine protein residues and forms covalent bonds with gliadin) are key antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Antibodies against tissue transglutaminase are present in serum from affected patients and are used to support the diagnosis of DH and celiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H23341214\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> below.)</p><p>A potential pathway through which exposure to dietary gluten could lead to DH is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the ingestion and digestion of gluten-containing food, gliadin is absorbed into the intestinal mucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gliadin is deaminated by tissue transglutaminase in the intestinal mucosa and covalent crosslinks are formed between gliadin and tissue transglutaminase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deaminated gliadin peptides bind to HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8 molecules on antigen presenting cells, where they are recognized by helper T cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The activated T cells then produce proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases that stimulate damage to the gut mucosa and the production of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase by B cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, epitope spreading (the development of an immune response against an endogenous antigen or multiple endogenous antigens due to exposure of an endogenous antigen during tissue damage) may occur and contribute to the production of antibodies that are capable of binding to epidermal transglutaminase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase antibodies travel through the bloodstream, and upon reaching the skin, complex with epidermal transglutaminase in the dermis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The deposition of immune complexes in the dermis stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis and proteolytic cleavage within the lamina lucida, leading to blistering.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261977824\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to genetic predisposition and dietary gluten exposure, other environmental factors may play a role in the development of DH. This concept is supported by a study that identified six patients with DH who had a monozygotic twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although the presence of a manifestation of gluten sensitivity (celiac disease, DH, or both disorders) was concordant in five of six twin sets, DH was present in both twins in only three twin sets. Additional study is necessary to confirm the pathogenic mechanisms of DH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643384077\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DH may experience cutaneous, oral, and gastrointestinal manifestations related to gluten-sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643388780\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic clinical finding in DH is the development of multiple intensely pruritic papules and vesicles that occur in grouped (&quot;herpetiform&quot;) arrangements. The elbows, dorsal forearms, knees, scalp, back, and buttocks are among the most common sites for lesion development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86749%7EDERM%2F86750%7EDERM%2F86751%7EDERM%2F86752%7EDERM%2F86768%7EDERM%2F78315\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86749 graphicRef86750 graphicRef86751 graphicRef86752 graphicRef86768 graphicRef78315 \">picture 1A-F</a>). The face and groin are less frequent sites of involvement. </p><p>Due to the associated pruritus, very few intact papules or vesicles are usually seen on clinical examination. Erosions and excoriations tend to be the most abundant clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86769 \">picture 1G</a>). </p><p>The extent of cutaneous involvement varies widely. Patients with mild disease present with involvement limited to a few localized areas, such as the knees or dorsal forearms, while patients with severe disease present with widely distributed lesions on the trunk and extremities. The skin lesions usually heal without scarring. However, postinflammatory pigmentary changes may develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Petechiae or purpuric macules on the fingers or palms are uncommon clinical features of DH. These lesions are more likely to occur in children, but may also appear in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Occasionally, acral petechiae or purpura are the primary cutaneous manifestations of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643388809\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of the oral mucosa is rare. Since most reports that document oral involvement in DH have not confirmed the diagnosis through direct immunofluorescence microscopy, there is some uncertainty regarding whether some cases have actually represented aphthous stomatitis or other disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Oral mucosal involvement may manifest as vesicles, erosions, or erythematous macules on the oral mucosa or tongue. Discomfort may or may not be present.</p><p>As with celiac disease, tooth enamel defects may occur in patients with DH. Patients may present with horizontal grooves, pits, or discoloration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a series of 30 adults with DH, 53 percent had enamel defects compared with only 2 percent of 66 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A series of 10 children with DH and no clinical symptoms of celiac disease also found an elevated rate of tooth abnormalities among patients with DH; 80 percent had bilateral enamel defects, whereas similar defects were seen in only 13 percent of healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643388787\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with DH (75 to 90 percent) have associated subclinical or clinical small bowel disease related to gluten-sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/11,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31</a>]. Findings on small bowel biopsy may demonstrate the villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia classically associated with celiac disease; other cases may demonstrate only mild findings such as increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes in intestinal microvilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Small bowel biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the common presence of histologic abnormalities in the gut, only a minority of DH patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptomatic patients may present with abdominal bloating, cramping, pain, diarrhea, or constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21110852\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DH is usually a life-long condition. However, the clinical course of skin disease is variable. While some patients experience intermittent eruptions that last only a few days and are separated by long asymptomatic periods, others develop continuous symptoms that wax and wane in severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Occasionally, spontaneous remissions occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2261977532\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23341200\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to celiac disease, other diseases may occur at increased frequencies in patients with DH. The most common associated condition is autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of 264 adults with DH, thyroid disease was documented in 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Hypothyroidism is more likely to occur than hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/32,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35,36</a>].</p><p>Type I diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia also may be more likely to develop in patients with DH. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in patients with DH is estimated to be between 2 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Between 1 and 3 percent of patients with DH may have pernicious anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other diseases that may occur with increased frequency in patients with DH include vitiligo, Addison's disease, alopecia areata, and several other autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>].</p><p>Celiac disease has been associated with an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk of malignancy and mortality'</a>). An increased risk for lymphoma may also occur in association with DH, though estimates of this risk have varied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/38-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-44</a>]. As an example, a Swedish population-based study that included 1354 patients with DH found a slightly increased overall risk for cancer (standard incidence ratio [SIR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4), which primarily appeared due to an increase in lymphoma and leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, a cohort study in the United Kingdom that included 84 patients with DH who were followed for a mean of 22 years found that the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma was increased in comparison to the general population (SIR 5.14, 95% CI 1.05-15.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In this study, the overall risk for malignancy was not increased (SIR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65-1.44). </p><p>The impact of a gluten-free diet on the risk for malignancy in patients with DH is uncertain. One retrospective study suggested a reduced risk for lymphoma among patients with a history of long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, additional studies are necessary to explore the impact of a gluten-free diet on the risk for malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643388880\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the recognition of consistent clinical findings, obtaining laboratory studies, including tissue pathology, direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIF), and serology can aid in the diagnosis of DH. DIF is considered the gold standard test for diagnosis.</p><p>Our initial approach to the diagnosis of DH in patients who present with suggestive clinical findings involves obtaining a lesional skin biopsy for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and a perilesional skin biopsy for DIF. We use serologic studies as adjunctive tests to support the diagnosis. Serology can also be useful for assessing adherence to dietary therapy. (See <a href=\"#H23341214\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23341348\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 4 mm punch biopsy is usually sufficient for obtaining a tissue specimen for routine histologic examination. The biopsy specimen ideally should be taken from the site of a small, intact vesicle. If no intact vesicles are present, the biopsy should be taken from an area of intact, inflamed skin. Biopsies of excoriated lesions may yield nonspecific findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>The histologic findings vary based upon the age of the lesion. The earliest lesions may demonstrate only collections of neutrophils (with or without eosinophils) and fibrin at the tips of the dermal papillae (papillary microabscesses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Lesions older than 48 hours begin to demonstrate subepidermal vesiculation at the papillary tips, which eventually connect to form larger subepidermal blisters that contain neutrophils, eosinophils, and fibrin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86748\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86748 \">picture 2</a>). A perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with varying numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils is usually found in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>The histologic findings in DH may resemble other subepithelial blistering disorders. In particular, DH can be difficult to distinguish from linear IgA bullous dermatosis and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. Bullous pemphigoid may also resemble DH histologically, but typically is characterized by a greater abundance of eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643388910\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct immunofluorescence microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DIF is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of DH. A 4 mm punch biopsy is typically utilized to obtain the tissue specimen. The biopsy should be taken from perilesional skin (normal-appearing skin adjacent to a lesion) because biopsies taken from lesional skin are more likely to yield falsely negative findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Michel's medium may be used to transport the specimen. Tissue for DIF should not be placed in formalin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-cutaneous-blisters#H4714358\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters&quot;, section on 'Direct immunofluorescence'</a>.)</p><p>The characteristic finding on DIF is the presence of granular deposits of IgA within the dermal papillae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86538 \">picture 3</a>). Deposits of IgM and C3 may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Infrequently, a fibrillar, rather than granular, pattern of IgA deposition is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. </p><p>Granular deposits of IgA along the basement membrane may also be seen in DH, and may lead to the misdiagnosis of DH as linear IgA bullous dermatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86539 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

Intensely pruritic conditions that present with excoriations and inflammatory papules, such as atopic dermatitis, scabies, and arthropod bites should be considered. Other subepidermal blistering diseases such as bullous pemphigoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72866\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72866 \">picture 5</a>), linear IgA bullous dermatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F51248%7EDERM%2F56434\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51248 graphicRef56434 \">picture 6A-B</a>), and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus are also included in the differential diagnosis. Blistering tends to be more prominent in these conditions than in DH. However, in the prodromal phase of bullous pemphigoid, blistering may be minimal or absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80385 \">picture 7</a>). The careful assessment of the patient history as well as the clinical, histopathologic, immunopathologic, and serologic findings usually successfully distinguishes DH from other disorders.

A gluten-free diet is effective for both DH and the often associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

Disadvantages of dapsone therapy include the potential for drug-related adverse events and its lack of effect on the gastrointestinal manifestations of gluten-sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

At the start of treatment, we prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> to induce rapid clearance of symptoms and simultaneously strongly encourage patients to eliminate gluten in their diets. We then slowly taper dapsone as tolerated, with a goal of eventually maintaining clinical improvement only on dietary therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21111917\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are usually managed by a dermatologist (for the management of DH) and a nutritionist (for dietary counseling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Pruritus usually improves within 72 hours, and the skin manifestations typically resolve within days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. No randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of dapsone in DH.</p><p>In adults with DH, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> is typically begun at 25 to 50 mg per day. The dose is slowly titrated upward (eg, a 25 mg increase in the daily dose each week up to a dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) based upon patient tolerance and the response to therapy. Our experience suggests that most adult patients on unrestricted diets respond fully to doses between 50 and 150 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Mild eruptions (eg, one to two new lesions per week) are expected at optimum dosing and are not an indication for increasing the dose of dapsone. Symptoms from these mild outbreaks can be treated with application of a potent topical corticosteroid. (See <a href=\"#H2261977229\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a> therapy is associated with a variety of potential adverse effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86540 \">table 1</a>). Some degree of hemolysis occurs in essentially all patients. Although this is tolerated by most patients, individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are at increased risk for severe hemolytic anemia. Examples of additional side effects include methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis, and a dapsone hypersensitivity reaction. When it occurs, agranulocytosis usually appears 2 to 12 weeks after the initiation of dapsone therapy. Dapsone-associated hypersensitivity syndrome classically presents with flu-like symptoms, a morbilliform cutaneous eruption, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic anemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Careful laboratory monitoring is necessary during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> therapy. We typically obtain a complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, and renal function tests prior to the start of therapy. A G6PD screen is also recommended since dapsone therapy is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. We repeat a CBC every one to two weeks for one month, and every one to three months during the first six months of therapy. Subsequently, we obtain a CBC every three to six months provided the dose of dapsone is not increased. Liver and renal function tests are performed every three to four months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Slow, progressive tapering of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> can be attempted after the patient has been on a gluten-free diet for two to three months (see <a href=\"#H2261977249\" class=\"local\">'Gluten-free diet'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Tapering too rapidly can result in disease flares. The best regimen for reducing the dose of dapsone has not been determined. We usually attempt to taper the drug by 12.5 mg every two to four weeks. In one study, tapering of dapsone to treatment cessation required an average of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261977249\"><span class=\"h3\">Gluten-free diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The designation of a gluten-free diet as a first-line treatment for DH is based upon uncontrolled studies and extensive clinical experience that support its benefit in DH and the dual efficacy of the diet for the cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations of gluten-sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/52,61,67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,61,67-70</a>]. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> is highly effective for inducing clinical remissions of DH, a gluten-free diet is our preferred option for long-term therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who adhere to a gluten-free diet are usually able to reduce the requirement for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> and eventually may be able to discontinue dapsone therapy. As an example, in a 36-month study of 81 patients with DH who were on a gluten-free diet for 6 to 36 months and 49 patients with DH who maintained a normal diet, reductions in the dose of dapsone were achieved in 93 versus 16 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. After one year, the average reduction in the dose of dapsone in patients on a gluten-free diet was 60 percent; the percentage reduction increased to 80 percent after three years. During the study period, 28 percent of patients on the gluten-free diet were able to discontinue dapsone completely. Among these patients, the mean amount of time required to discontinue dapsone was two years.</p><p>Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is challenging. Counseling with a dietician is recommended to help patients to identify and eliminate both obvious and hidden sources of dietary gluten and to assist patients with finding alternatives to gluten-containing foods. Multiple resources that provide information on gluten-free diets are available. Examples include the Celiac Disease Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.celiac.org/&amp;token=nEewIP08Ktv0DdrkttzjcJJiBdkd4HzrpDc8nfUl0Zw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15307\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.celiac.org</a>) and the Gluten Intolerance Group (<a href=\"http://www.gluten.net/&amp;token=sQsY3q/eCjaueI9YhGWWW1WLCP+9caelKjtomT90pTI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15307\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.gluten.net</a>). Whether a gluten-free diet reduces the risk for autoimmune diseases and malignancy in patients with DH is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Is strict gluten avoidance necessary?'</a>.)</p><p>If a relapse of DH occurs in a patient on a strict gluten-free diet, the possibility of exposure to hidden sources of gluten should be considered. Close review of the diet with a dietician may identify unintentional sources of gluten intake. For severe recurrences, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> can be reinstituted with the same regimen used for initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1643384272\" class=\"local\">'Dapsone'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261977207\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87246548\"><span class=\"h3\">Other sulfa-based drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who cannot tolerate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, other sulfonamide drugs are options for pharmacotherapy. However, there is much less experience with the use of these therapies. </p><p>Case reports document successful treatment of DH with sulfapyridine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>]. Although sulfasalazine is metabolized to sulfapyridine in the intestine, the absorption of sulfapyridine (the active drug) is more predictable when sulfapyridine is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/73,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,76</a>]. Thus, our preference is to use sulfapyridine. Sulfapyridine may be given to adults at a starting dose of 0.5 g three times per day, which may be increased to up to 6 g per day if necessary to control patient symptoms. Sulfasalazine has been reported to be effective in doses between 1 and 2 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>Of these two agents, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> is commercially available in the United States. Sulfapyridine may be obtained through compounding pharmacies. </p><p>Although sulfapyridine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> do not cause the hemolysis seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> therapy, agranulocytosis and hypersensitivity reactions are potential adverse effects. In addition, adequate fluid intake is recommended during treatment with these drugs to reduce the risk for drug-induced nephrolithiasis. As with dapsone, laboratory monitoring should be performed periodically. We typically follow a CBC, liver function panel, and urinalysis.</p><p>Sulfamethoxypyridazine has also been reported to be effective for DH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].

Due to the pruritus, excoriations and erosions are often the most prominent clinical manifestations. The elbows, forearms, knees, buttocks, back, and scalp are common sites for lesion development. (See <a href=\"#H1643384077\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with DH may have an increased risk for the development of other autoimmune diseases. Thyroid disease is the most common autoimmune disorder associated with DH. Patients with DH may also have an increased risk for lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H23341200\" class=\"local\">'Associated diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of DH is made based on both the clinical findings and laboratory studies. The gold standard test for diagnosis is direct immunofluorescence (DIF). DIF classically demonstrates granular deposits of IgA within the papillary dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86538 \">picture 3</a>). Serologic studies that identify circulating IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, epidermal transglutaminase, and endomysium are useful for confirming the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1643388880\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our preferred approach to the treatment of DH consists of both pharmacotherapy and dietary therapy. For children and adults with DH, we suggest treatment with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> and a gluten-free diet as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Subsequently, dapsone may be slowly tapered with the goal of sustaining remission with dietary therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1643384165\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DH is usually a life-long condition that requires continued treatment. Spontaneous remission may occur in a minority of patients.
