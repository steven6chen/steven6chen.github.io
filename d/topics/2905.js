They are designed to speed recovery from acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, myocardial revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure and to improve quality of life. In addition, patients with stable coronary heart disease derive benefits.

The goals of these sessions are to develop and teach an individualized exercise prescription that is both safe and effective, to initiate interventions aimed at reducing coronary risk factors, and to identify and manage the psychosocial problems that commonly affect the cardiac patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Testing procedures to assess exercise capacity are discussed separately.

With the shortening of hospital stays, the goal of caregivers during the hospital stay is to promote early ambulation, to introduce patients to the goals of cardiac rehabilitation, <strong>and</strong> to enroll individuals in upcoming outpatient programs. </p><p>The first visit at an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program can be as early as the first week after hospitalization for an uncomplicated myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with complicated hospital courses or who received coronary artery bypass grafting may have to wait longer before starting. For patients who had had percutaneous coronary intervention either by radial or femoral approach, cardiac rehabilitation should be delayed until discomfort and hematoma are resolved. Cardiac rehabilitation is typically ordered by cardiology health professionals who can be contacted and make recommendations if patients have untoward responses to exercise.&nbsp;However, some primary care providers are comfortable prescribing cardiac rehabilitation services and monitoring a patient&rsquo;s progress.</p><p>There is evidence that early enrollment improves subsequent attendance and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. In an observational study of 1241 patients hospitalized for a cardiac event or cardiac surgery, a delay in beginning cardiac rehabilitation by more than 30 days was an independent predictor of a decreased improvement in exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Although patients of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to participate in and complete rehabilitation, one study indicated that financial incentives may be an efficacious strategy for increasing cardiac rehabilitation participation and adherence among Medicaid (United States) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Further, there is now an institutional incentive for enrollment of previously hospitalized patients in cardiac rehabilitation, published by the (United States) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It includes in the bundle services payment post-hospitalization, an incentive payment to the institution for the enrollment and attendance of patients in cardiac rehabilitation (GMS-5519-F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise goals of a cardiac rehabilitation program are to assess the patient&rsquo;s baseline ability and limitations, to develop an exercise prescription, to observe that patient&rsquo;s response to that prescription, and to encourage long-term participation in regular unsupervised exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The components of an exercise prescription include the mode, frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75107 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60257%7ECARD%2F73513\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60257 graphicRef73513 \">table 1A-B</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273709775\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification for exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of cardiovascular complications from exercise training should be evaluated before starting an exercise program. The risk stratification guidelines published by the American Heart Association use four categories of risk according to clinical characteristics and include contraindications for exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50753%7ECARD%2F60012%7ECARD%2F72809%7ECARD%2F52847%7ECARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50753 graphicRef60012 graphicRef72809 graphicRef52847 graphicRef80110 \">table 3A-E</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class A individuals are apparently healthy and have no clinical evidence of increased cardiovascular risk of exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class B individuals have clinically stable coronary heart disease. These individuals are at low risk of cardiovascular complications of vigorous exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class C individuals are at moderate or high risk of cardiac complications during exercise by virtue of a history of multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs) or cardiac arrest, New York Heart Association class III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 4</a>), exercise capacity of less than six metabolic equivalents (METs), and significant ischemia on the exercise test. One MET is defined as 3.5 mL O<sub>2</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">uptake/kg</span> per min, which is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise assessment and measurement of exercise capacity in patients with coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class D patients are those with unstable disease who require restriction of activity and for whom exercise is contraindicated.</p><p/><p>Patients referred for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation typically belong to class B or C. They require different degrees of monitoring or supervision during exercise. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Supervision'</a> below.)</p><p>Although generally beneficial in class B and C patients, supervised exercise rehabilitation is associated with a small risk of adverse events. The 2007 American Heart Association scientific statement on exercise and acute cardiovascular events estimated that the risk of any major cardiovascular complication (cardiac arrest, death, or MI) is one event in 60,000 to 80,000 hours of supervised exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation: Indications, efficacy, and safety in patients with coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p>Although there are no contraindications to comprehensive secondary prevention programs, contraindications to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation generally focus on the unstable Class D patient for whom exercise training is not recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108259 \">table 5</a>). The American College of Sports Medicine lists specific contraindications to cardiac rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of exercise should be one that requires the use of large muscle groups and aerobic exercise such as walking, jogging, cycling, rowing, machine stair climbing, and other endurance activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/7,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20,21</a>]. Low impact activities are recommended because of a lesser risk of physical injury. The mode or modes of exercise chosen should be enjoyable for the individual and simple to carry out to maximize compliance. Selected exercise modalities must take into account physical limitations and musculoskeletal issues of the participants.&nbsp;For example, rowing has both aerobic and resistive exercise components. It requires good technique and can result in overuse or back injuries for individuals with pre-existing problems. Among post-CABG patients, upper body strengthening and weight lifting should be assessed individually based on the patients' chest wall symptoms after sternotomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended frequency of exercise is at least three times a week but preferably on most days of the week, which is necessary to achieve a significant improvement in functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21</a>]. Programs vary in their duration but 12 weeks is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each exercise session includes three phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up for 5 to 10 minutes. Warm-up exercises consist of stretching, flexibility movements, and aerobic activity that gradually increases the heart rate into the target range. This gradual increment in oxygen demand minimizes the risk of exercise-related cardiovascular complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditioning or training phase, which consists of at least 20 minutes and preferably 30 to 45 minutes of continuous or discontinuous aerobic activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool down for 5 to 10 minutes. The cool-down period involves low-intensity exercise and permits a gradual recovery from the conditioning phase. Omission of cool-down can result in a transient decrease in venous return, reducing coronary blood flow when heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption remain high. Adverse consequences can include hypotension, angina, ischemic ST-T changes, and ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intensity of exercise may range from 40 to 85 percent of functional capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max), which corresponds to 55 to 90 percent of maximal heart rate (estimated as 220 minus the age in years, or more accurately measured at the highest exercise intensity on the maximal exercise test). Estimated heart rate is inappropriate for patients using heart rate-limiting cardiac drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The target heart rate range may be determined by several methods. Selection of a fixed percentage of maximal heart rate is the method most commonly used to guide exercise intensity. A percentage range is calculated from the maximal heart rate (percent HRmax) reached at peak exercise during a symptom-limited exercise tolerance test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Exercise intensity has been categorized using the percent HRmax as light (&lt;60 percent), moderate (60 to 79 percent), and heavy (80 percent).</p><p>Energy expenditure is related to both intensity and duration. In general, lower intensity exercise should be performed for a longer duration. Symptom-limited patients may begin with discontinuous exercise and progress to 20 to 30 minutes of continuous exercise. The duration is increased before increasing the intensity. It is common for cardiac rehabilitation patients to rotate among a variety of dynamic exercise modalities: treadmill, bicycle, Schwinn Aerodyne, arm ergometer, rowing machine, etc. Energy expenditure and heart rate response are related to the intensity of the activity and the amount of muscle mass used to perform the activity.</p><p>Beta blockers, which are administered to most patients after MI, reduce the cardiac output response to exercise predominantly by limiting heart rate. Although resting heart rate, submaximal, and maximal exercise heart rates are reduced by beta blockers, traditional heart rate methods may be used to prescribe exercise intensity based on the patient's maximal heart rate measured during an exercise test performed on medication.</p><p>Symptom-limited exercise test refers to a submaximal testing modality often conducted before initiating a cardiac rehabilitation program to establish a baseline fitness level, determine maximal heart rate, and assess the safety of exercise by observing symptoms and electrocardiographic indications of ischemia or cardiac arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A symptom-limited exercise test is terminated at the onset of symptoms related to coronary heart disease, usually chest pain or shortness of breath (or leg fatigue if it is severe and occurs before the patient reaches age-predicted functional capacity). This heart rate level becomes the maximal heart rate, and the exercise training heart rate is a given.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of the heart rate maximum reserve (a percent of the difference between the maximal and resting heart rates). A table shows an example of an exercise prescription using the HRmax reserve method in a 40-year-old individual (HRmax of 180), with a resting heart rate of 60 and a desired exercise intensity of 60 to 80 percent capacity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50179 \">table 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation of the relationship between exercise heart rate and VO<sub>2</sub> or METs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63482\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63482 \">figure 1</a>). One MET is defined as 3.5 mL O<sub>2</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">uptake/kg</span> per min, which is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position. These methods require the monitoring of heart rate or pulse-taking.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Rating of perceived exertion (Borg scale)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise intensity can also be prescribed using the rating of perceived exertion (RPE or Borg scale) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 7</a>). This is a validated method that most patients can learn and apply easily and is valuable with unsupervised exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. On the category scale (6 to 20), an RPE of 12 to 13 (somewhat hard) corresponds to 60 percent VO<sub>2</sub>max and an RPE of 16 (hard to very hard) corresponds to 85 percent VO<sub>2</sub>max. An individual's subjective response during graded exercise testing is employed in specifying the RPE level for exercise training. The rating or perceived exertion appeared equally effective in guiding exercise intensity of patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation whether in a supervised center-based setting or a self-care, home-based setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The exercise intensity for healthy adults is usually 60 to 70 percent of functional capacity (using VO<sub>2</sub>max, maximal METs, or heart rate maximum reserve) or a 12 to 13 level of the RPE scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 7</a>). The incremental benefit of very high intensity exercise (&gt;90 percent of HRmax) is small and is not recommended because it leads to lactate accumulation and fatigue, and increases the risk of physical injury and cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>].</p><p>Individuals with a low-baseline fitness level, which is often the case with cardiac patients, should begin at a lower percentage of capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients with stable angina may have an exercise prescription based upon 60 to 70 percent of the heart rate at which ischemic ST segment changes or anginal symptoms appear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another important element of the exercise prescription is the progression of exercise. Although there is no standard format for exercise progression, progression should be individualized according to patient tolerance, motivation and goals, symptoms, baseline fitness level, and musculoskeletal limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients exercising below 3.5 METs on exit from cardiac rehabilitation represent a high-risk group with one- and three-year event rates &ge;7 and &ge;18 percent, respectively. Thus, the MET level cane be used to identify patients at increased risk for an event who may benefit from closer follow-up, extension of length of cardiac rehabilitation, etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Supervision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The last important consideration when prescribing an exercise regimen in a cardiac rehabilitation program is the level of supervision required:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at moderate or high risk of cardiac complications from exercise (Class C) should participate in a medically supervised program with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and personnel and equipment suitable for advanced cardiac life support. This level of medical supervision should be continued for 8 to 12 weeks until the safety of the prescribed exercise regimen has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-risk patients (class B) may initially benefit from medically supervised ECG-monitored exercise (6 to 12 sessions), which helps to reassure the patient about the safety of the program. Self-monitored, home-based exercise programs also have been shown to be effective and safe in these patients, and result in better rates of adherence when compared to group-based programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Patients may exercise without supervision when they understand how to monitor activity levels. They are taught to guide exercise intensity by heart rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RPE. Low-level isometric (resistance) activities may be prescribed for low-risk patients to increase muscular strength.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many cardiac rehabilitation programs incorporate resistance training along with aerobic exercise training once the aerobic exercise targets have been attained. The primary goals are to increase muscle strength, endurance, and mass, thereby enhancing a patient's ability to perform household and vocational tasks.</p><p>Resistance exercises are referenced to the individual's measured or estimated maximal strength or the &quot;one-repetition maximum,&quot; the maximal weight a patient can lift once. A general recommendation for resistance training in cardiac patients includes 30 to 40 percent of the one-repetition maximum for upper body exercises and 40 to 50 percent of the one-repetition maximum for lower body exercises; there are 12 to 15 repetitions per set, performed two to three times weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With regard to exercise training within the context of a cardiac rehabilitation program, the goal is to get patients to participate in regular physical activity long term.

As an example, compliance with exercise, diet, and smoking cessation should be assessed regularly by the rehabilitation nurses and physical therapists.

Depression is associated with lower exercise capacity, less energy, more fatigue, and a reduced quality of life and sense of well-being.

Individual or group psychotherapy and sometimes pharmacotherapy can be beneficial.

There was no evidence of a difference in mortality, reinfarction, revascularization, cardiac-associated hospitalization, or exercise capacity between the two modes of intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A 2015 meta-analysis, which included five additional trials with 345 heart failure patients, found that the two modes were similar in the benefits provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. An updated Cochrane Review compared the effects of home-based versus supervises center-based cardiac rehabilitation, with data available through October 2014. It included patients with myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, or who had undergone coronary revascularization. The conclusion was that home- and center-based cardiac rehabilitation provided similar benefits in clinical and health-related quality-of-life outcomes at equivalent cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Other alternatives include community-based group programs with guidance by nurses or other nonphysician healthcare providers, and electronic media programs for home-based comprehensive risk modification, education, and instruction, as well as for guidance of a structured exercise regimen. Use of mobile health technologies may further expand cardiac rehabilitation availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Telehealth exercise cardiac rehabilitation appears to be at least as effective as center-based cardiac rehabilitation in improving modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and functional capacity. It identifies the option of telehealth and the technologic advances to provide more comprehensive, responsive, and interactive interventions for individuals for whom center-based rehabilitation is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The long-term assessment of the effectiveness of these approaches and the optimal mode of their delivery remain unknown. The attractiveness of these models is the potential to provide cardiac rehabilitation to low- and moderate-risk coronary patients who comprise the majority of contemporary postinfarction patients, most of whom do not participate in structured, supervised cardiac rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1490132174\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPLEMENTAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cardiac rehabilitation programs have a fixed duration and as such the benefit might decline with time. It is possible that additional referral to other community-based lifestyle intervention programs that provide assistance with lifestyle modification may improve long-term outcomes. This approach was evaluated in a study of 824 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery revascularization procedure who had one or more of the following lifestyle risk factors (LRF): body mass index &gt;27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> self-reported physical inactivity, or smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-programs/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
