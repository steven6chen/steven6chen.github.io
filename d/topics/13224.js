In the past, it was common for emergency medical service (EMS) agencies to employ the &ldquo;load and go&rdquo; philosophy when providing prehospital care to an ill or injured child without strong emphasis on the provision of pediatric-specific stabilization. More recently, many agencies have improved the level of prehospital pediatric care and invested in training and equipment for their prehospital providers (eg, emergency medical technicians, paramedics). </p><p>In the United States, the federally supported Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) program has been a major factor in promoting more intensive prehospital care within existing EMS systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The EMSC program has supported prehospital pediatric research, developed educational tools for prehospital providers, and assessed the availability of equipment, online medical direction, and offline protocols for pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, pediatric focused offline protocols where providers can reference assessment tools, management pathways, or pediatric medication dosing or equipment types and sizing are more widely available. In addition, online medical direction by pediatric emergency medicine specialists with expertise in prehospital care is occurring in select EMS agencies throughout the United States. The EMS for Children program is integrating quality improvement methodology into its work through the EMS for Children Innovation and Improvement Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7779219\"><span class=\"h1\">ONLINE MEDICAL CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Online medical control consists of physician direction, supervision, and authorization of prehospital treatment by phone, radio, or at the scene in real time. The physician is often located at a base station that often is not located at the facility that will eventually receive the patient. In some settings, online medical control implies 24-hour availability of physicians to provide prehospital medical direction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H365267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Base station personnel'</a>.) </p><p>Physicians who will provide online medical control should have pediatric emergency medicine knowledge and skills, specific training, a good understanding of the general approach to direction of prehospital treatment, and detailed knowledge of the pediatric protocols in use in their region. Medical control physicians should also have a clear understanding of the abilities of the prehospital providers, their limitations, and overall system constraints. </p><p>While online medical control does permit customized prehospital medical care, it may delay transport to definitive care and is labor-intensive. In many systems, much of prehospital care is provided through standard protocols. (See <a href=\"#H7779305\" class=\"local\">'Offline medical control'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1564299\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical direction training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be most effective, physicians who provide online pediatric medical control should have a proper understanding of how to fulfill that role as well as specific knowledge of their local and regional emergency medical services (EMS). Key actions to optimize their online medical direction include (see <a href=\"#H1564051\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain pediatric emergency medicine knowledge and skills with emphasis on the specific types of critical illness and injury that commonly require prehospital intervention (eg, respiratory diseases, seizures, trauma, poisoning).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'The EMS system'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H365214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Dispatch personnel'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Scope of practice'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain specific education on how to provide online medical direction. Many emergency physicians receive specific training in online medical direction during their emergency medicine residency or fellowship in pediatric emergency medicine or emergency medical services. Others may take online medical direction courses provided by various organizations (eg, the National Association of EMS Physicians). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understand the local system or systems in which they practice including the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type of system (eg, public, private or volunteer systems) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Types of EMS systems'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Organization of the dispatch system and prehospital response to an emergency call (eg, tiered versus non-tiered). In the context of EMS, tiered response refers to level of provider training and timing to dispatch of providers to a scene. For example, tiered systems may be single-tiered (advanced life support response [ALS] or basic life support [BLS] response only), two-tiered (basic life support [BLS] and ALS), or three-tiered (physician). Except for multiple casualty incidents, it remains rare for medical directors in North America to be included in the dispatch protocol. This is in contrast to some countries in Europe where physicians may be dispatched directly to the scene to provide care for the critically ill or injured patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Level of preparedness for pediatric encounters based upon initial and ongoing prehospital provider education, training, and experience</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The policies, capabilities and capacity of the region&rsquo;s EMS agencies and hospitals. For example, some hospitals may be more capable than others to stabilize the acutely ill or injured child. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The regional laws governing EMS and emergency department (ED) operations. For example, consent and do-not-resuscitate laws are not consistent across jurisdictions and ignorance of the law does not protect the clinician from prosecution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Communication channels and equipment used to connect providers on scene with medical directors and hospitals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Policy and procedures for hospital patient delivery and hand-offs (eg, SBAR &ndash; Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1564306\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to every prehospital notification of transport should be organized and consistent. The medical control physician should always be cordial during prehospital communications and available for updates during prehospital transport. Medical control physicians should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identify</strong> <strong>themselves to the caller as a medical control physician</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identify the callers and clarify their capabilities (ie, scope of practice)</strong> &ndash; The medical control physicians may be contacted by different prehospital personnel including: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dispatcher, base station, EMS medical director, or provider on scene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H365214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Dispatch personnel'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Basic life support (BLS) personnel (eg, emergency medical responder [EMR], first responder [FR], emergency medical technician [EMT]), advanced life support (ALS) providers (advanced EMT, paramedic, supervisor, nurse or physician) &ndash; If not already established, the medical control physician needs to assess the prehospital provider&rsquo;s ability to respond to medical direction for patient management and social, legal, or administrative issues during the transport. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Scope of practice'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Request patient information</strong> &ndash; Key information includes age, brief history, physical assessment, treatment provided, and response to interventions. Prehospital providers often use physical assessment tools and scores such as the pediatric assessment triangle, the pediatric Glasgow coma scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 1</a>), or trauma triage scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52562 \">table 2</a>) to rapidly communicate the severity of illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-stabilization-of-children-with-respiratory-or-circulatory-compromise#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise&quot;, section on 'Pediatric assessment triangle'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of trauma in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The length of this exchange will depend upon many variables including the safety of the scene, the provider&rsquo;s level of training, and the condition of the patient. It may be necessary to interrupt the prehospital provider during the communication to reorient the priorities to stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. For example, a field report that the child is intubated does not insure that the endotracheal tube (ETT) is properly placed. The clinician may need to stop and ask the provider what confirmatory measures have occurred to prove that the ETT is in the trachea, such as qualitative end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement or auscultation, before proceeding with the rest of the exchange.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When time permits, it is often necessary to remind the prehospital provider to involve the caregiver in the patient&rsquo;s assessment, especially when the patient is a child with special health care needs. Often the caregiver&rsquo;s assessment of mental status, respiratory effort, or color relative to the child&rsquo;s normal baseline is essential to determine proper prehospital interventions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ensure provider safety</strong> &ndash; The environment in which emergency medical services (EMS) providers practice is rarely as safe and controlled as that of the medical control physician. The providers will typically ensure that their surroundings are safe from physical harm before proceeding with patient assessment and management. However, occasionally the medical control physician may recognize risk that was not noted by the provider (eg, exposure to transmittable infection diseases or toxins) and can remind the provider to don appropriate personal protective equipment. When a serious infectious disease exposure has occurred, the EMS agency&rsquo;s infection control officer should also be contacted once patient transport has been completed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provide patient care recommendations</strong> &ndash; When making patient care recommendations, the clinician must understand the capabilities and constraints of the prehospital provider and the medications and equipment available to them. For example, it is <strong>not</strong> appropriate to order a basic life support provider to perform endotracheal intubation because they are not licensed or trained to do this procedure. Prehospital providers also typically operate under protocols that have been approved by their offline medical director. Depending upon the jurisdiction, they may or may not be able to perform actions that are not part of their protocol unless their medical director gives online approval. (See <a href=\"#H7779305\" class=\"local\">'Offline medical control'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the medical control physician is unsure about the prehospital provider&rsquo;s capabilities, medications, or supplies, the best course of action is to directly ask the provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional considerations when making prehospital care recommendations include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Request length-based weight estimates when the actual weight is not known to provide appropriate pediatric drug dosing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-stabilization-of-children-with-respiratory-or-circulatory-compromise#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise&quot;, section on 'Estimation of weight'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ask for the concentration of the medication to be delivered and order the recommended dose by weight (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> and volume (eg, mL). The prehospital provider should repeat the drug and dose back to the medical control physician to ensure the order has been received and properly understood. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recognize that the availability of equipment that is specific to children is often limited in the prehospital environment. In the United States, a recommended list of pediatric-sized equipment for ambulances has been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82004 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59854 \">table 4</a>). Unfortunately, not all United States EMS agencies comply with those recommendations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Balance the delay in transport with the benefits of performing a recommendation. (See <a href=\"#H7779321\" class=\"local\">'Timing of prehospital interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allow time for the recommendation to be carried out before requesting a status update. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remind the provider to reassess the child for changes in condition throughout transport.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Determine the receiving hospital and estimated time of arrival (ETA)</strong> &ndash; In some circumstances (eg, level 1 trauma patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81002\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81002 \">algorithm 1</a>)), the receiving hospital is predetermined by local or regional jurisdictions. In many systems, the prehospital providers have a good understanding of the facilities with the best pediatric resources. Otherwise, the medical control physician should select the receiving hospital that will provide the best care for the pediatric patient&rsquo;s condition while also limiting ambulance transport time. (See <a href=\"#H7779729\" class=\"local\">'Hospital destination'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perform administrative duties </strong>&ndash; The medical control physician should ensure documentation of communication with the prehospital provider including the correct transcription of any medication orders or recommended interventions. Keep in mind that systems may vary on the requirements for documenting the input of internal and physician direction and medical management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, the physician may bill for online advanced life support (ALS) medical direction. The physician must be located in a hospital emergency department or critical care unit but neither a face-to-face service nor documentation of the service is required although documentation to support the billing is prudent. Billing cannot occur for off-line medical control. The physician can send a bill independently from any other ED evaluation and management services (eg, EMS ALS on-line direction is done at a site other than the receiving hospital) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ensure compliance with legal requirements </strong>&ndash; The medical control physician should provide the prehospital provider with recommendations that are in accordance with prevailing laws in each jurisdiction regarding (see <a href=\"#H2111697\" class=\"local\">'Difficult situations'</a> below): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reporting of child abuse, </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Honoring of &ldquo;do not resuscitate&rdquo; orders, </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ability of a patient to refuse treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Actions to take if a legal guardian refuses medical transport. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7779305\"><span class=\"h1\">OFFLINE MEDICAL CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Offline medical control refers, in part, to the administration of emergency medical services (EMS) by an emergency medical services physician director using standardized prehospital care protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These protocols are in place to direct prehospital care and authorize specific medical treatments within a field provider&rsquo;s scope of practice without the need for real time communication. The prehospital provider often also has the ability to directly contact a medical control physician during prehospital treatment for the provision of care outside of standard protocol, if questions arise, or if a protocol does not specifically apply to the patient&rsquo;s condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H365267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'Base station personnel'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems#H365281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital pediatrics and emergency medical services (EMS)&quot;, section on 'EMS direction'</a>.) </p><p>Offline prehospital protocols facilitate rapid and effective treatment, standardize management actions for prehospital providers and provide a reference for EMS practice standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The use of patient care protocols has also been shown to be effective in monitoring processes in medical care and providing a mechanism to provide feedback to emergency medical services personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Many pediatric prehospital protocols exist but may vary from region to region. In the United States, national model pediatric prehospital protocols have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) has created a set of Model Clinical EMS Guidelines intended for use for all ages, and each guideline has been reviewed to include pediatric considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, adoption of these guidelines is voluntary and has not occurred in many jurisdictions. </p><p>Most protocols that EMS systems use are formulated based upon expert opinion or consensus. The lack of high quality evidence from randomized trials in the prehospital setting reflects a limited number of prehospital researchers and the challenges associated with obtaining consent in the prehospital setting; this is especially true in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7779321\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF PREHOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On scene recommendations should include those treatments that are time - sensitive, have clear benefit, are generally easy and fast to perform, and could be life-saving. It is essential for a prehospital provider to respond to life-threatening conditions (eg, apnea, hypoxemia, hypoglycemia, or external hemorrhage). It is not appropriate for the clinician to delay the transport of a stable patient so that elective procedures (eg, intravenous access) can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Examples of appropriate on scene prehospital interventions are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83778\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83778 \">table 5</a>). </p><p>En route recommendations should include the initiation or continuation of those treatments indicated for on scene delivery and those that may add additional benefit without delaying transport time or further injury to child.

Children with potential or suspected cervical spine injury by history, physical exam, or mechanism of injury should undergo immobilization in a cervical collar. The prehospital provider must ensure the use of appropriately sized pediatric equipment to avoid excess motion of the cervical spine and potential airway compromise from inadequate padding under the shoulders or improperly sized cervical spine collars. Young athletes wearing helmets and shoulder pads (eg, American football players) should have the helmet left on with the face mask removed during cervical spine immobilization. Children wearing helmets without shoulder pads (eg, dirt bike riders, cyclists) should have the helmet removed prior to cervical spine immobilization.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon one randomized trial and one large registry study, children with cardiac arrest who receive prehospital bag-mask ventilation versus artificial airway placement have equivalent or better neurologically intact survival than those who undergo prehospital endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] or placement of a supraglottic airway (eg, laryngeal mask airway) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced airway management </strong>&ndash; The role of prehospital endotracheal intubation in the pediatric patient is unclear. Further study of prehospital use of artificial airways during pediatric prehospital care is needed to determine whether they provide any additional benefit over bag-mask ventilation. As noted above, bag-mask ventilation appears to have similar or better outcomes with fewer serious adverse events than endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway placement in children with cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Nevertheless, in systems where transport times are long and when rigorous training and maintenance of advanced airway skills by paramedics can be assured, placement of an artificial airway may be beneficial in selected patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular access &ndash;</strong> Prehospital vascular access permits administration of medications that may improve the patient&rsquo;s condition prior to arrival at the receiving hospital (eg, patients with seizures, anaphylaxis, or hypoglycemia). However, establishing peripheral intravenous (IV) access can be difficult in the prehospital setting, especially in younger, less cooperative children. At the scene, two patient care providers are available, one to perform vascular access and the other to assist with holding and securing the intravenous line. When en route, typically only one provider is available to perform and secure vascular access. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, intraosseous cannulation permits more rapid prehospital vascular access with similar rates of success. In situations where immediate vascular access is necessary to address life-threatening illness, intraosseous cannulation should be advised for prehospital providers who have the appropriate training and scope of practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraosseous-infusion#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraosseous infusion&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2111697\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult situations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565393\"><span class=\"h3\">Disagreement with prehospital provider</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the prehospital provider disagrees or refuses to comply with the medical control physician&rsquo;s recommendation, the physician should attempt to further understand the situation and, if needed, request immediate communication with the emergency medical services agency&rsquo;s medical director. The medical control physician must understand that typically the prehospital provider is licensed to practice solely under the medical license of their acting medical director and can refuse direction by other physicians that fall outside of standard protocols unless the medical director is contacted and directs them to comply. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565362\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient refuses treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An unemancipated or immature minor cannot refuse emergency medical treatment and the best approach when a legal guardian cannot be identified is to provide prehospital treatment and transportation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Furthermore, some governmental statutes recognize a mature minor exception that allows minors over a certain age, usually 14 years, to make medical decisions. However, the specific aspects of these exceptions vary according to region.

For time-sensitive conditions, such as trauma, expediting transport may need to take priority over having a higher level of provider for the transport. As a general rule, ground transport is more readily available if an emergency facility is within 20 to 30 minutes of the scene, and air transport is better if there is rough terrain or a long distance between the scene and the emergency facility.

In contrast, limited observational evidence in children suggests that paramedics with the support of online medical control can safely identify pediatric patients who do not require ambulance transportation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/38,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44</a>].</p><p>In EMS systems that allow prehospital providers to refuse transportation of children on the basis of a non-urgent complaint, the following key components are essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate training of prehospital personnel with an emphasis on accurate pediatric assessment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear policies and procedures to guide prehospital triage decisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Required on-line medical oversight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capacity in the local primary care network to provide early follow-up for children who are not transported</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing quality improvement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1564051\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following resources are available to augment online and offline prehospital pediatric care:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency Medical Service for Children (EMSC) &ndash; <a href=\"http://emscimprovement.center/&amp;token=Y3VMJz9W7d1D/Nycy8hhAG99RnfDB8OefuxUGCZ/Qu+T79zTwP5A45G2iMzU6Lf0&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://emscimprovement.center/</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physician prehospital pediatrics course &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.moodlemedce.com/pem-education/login/index.php&amp;token=bCgkIGD8dvYUmgYVqQIAAeFRRsuU0XKgxWbWXo6oJ0sZIQpYvw2tvUwwhVks/waTE1eRST/OUciGXW7s6uDW3Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.moodlemedce.com/pem-education/login/index.php</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>National Association of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Physicians model pediatric protocols &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.kdheks.gov/cphp/download/cacs_template/ModelPediatricProtocols.pdf&amp;token=YlNxwqRKeCxvnS50h3lnmyGxxAexNp/wz32C03Zj6RoabBhwuU7NhVmKxi99lDrZuhMNpzw6dlyPrXziCr9r516AKnz4dbCc1d+TyzDBSo0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.kdheks.gov/cphp/download/cacs_template/ModelPediatricProtocols.pdf</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>National Association of EMS Physicians base station course &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.naemsp.org/Pages/Products.aspx&amp;token=W+V6hvKS0rORATNdvWG3U/KGao3uZ4U7PWckc0g5/254bWZCEQzBjYL1fbaDzjl7+0XKSYqX1no5PoMvgmT0fw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.naemsp.org/Pages/Products.aspx</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7779797\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Online medical control consists of physician direction, supervision, and authorization of prehospital treatment by phone, radio, or at the scene in real time. The physician is located at a base station that often is <strong>not</strong> located at the facility that will eventually receive the patient. (See <a href=\"#H7779219\" class=\"local\">'Online medical control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physicians who will provide online medical control should have pediatric emergency medicine knowledge and skills, specific training, a good understanding of the general approach to direction of prehospital treatment, and detailed knowledge of the regulations and pediatric protocols in use in their region. Medical control physicians should also have a clear understanding of the abilities of the prehospital providers, their limitations, and overall system constraints. (See <a href=\"#H1564299\" class=\"local\">'Medical direction training'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general approach to communication of a prehospital provider with a medical director is discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H1564306\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offline medical control refers, in part, to the administration of emergency medical services (EMS) by an EMS physician director through the use of standardized prehospital care protocols. These protocols are in place to direct prehospital care and authorize specific medical treatments within a field provider&rsquo;s scope of practice without the need for real time communication. (See <a href=\"#H7779305\" class=\"local\">'Offline medical control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7779611\" class=\"local\">'Medical and surgical emergencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On scene recommendations should include those treatments that are time sensitive, have clear benefit, are generally easy and fast to perform and could be life-saving (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83778\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83778 \">table 5</a>). Common prehospital pediatric procedures include cervical spine immobilization, basic and advanced airway management, and vascular access. Difficult prehospital situations that frequently warrant online medical control or communication with the EMS agency&rsquo;s medical director include disagreement with a prehospital provider, treatment refusal, advanced directives, and suspected child abuse. (See <a href=\"#H7779321\" class=\"local\">'Timing of prehospital interventions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2113991\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric procedures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2111697\" class=\"local\">'Difficult situations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When deciding the mode of transport and destination hospital, key factors include the child&rsquo;s condition, the type and location of the best emergency facility for providing definite pediatric care, safety, and weather conditions. In general, the optimal receiving facility for a critically ill or injured child should have large pediatric volume and availability of expertise in the intensive care of children as well as physicians trained in pediatric subspecialties, such as pediatric emergency medicine, pediatric critical care medicine, and pediatric surgery. General emergency departments are typically capable of managing acute airway emergencies and stabilization of other critical pediatric conditions prior to transfer for definitive care. (See <a href=\"#H7779713\" class=\"local\">'Ground versus air transport'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7779729\" class=\"local\">'Hospital destination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During ambulance transport, the use of lights and sirens should be reserved for the most critically ill patients who remain unstable despite prehospital treatment as a means of reducing the risk of traffic collisions and to advise other drivers that an emergent situation exists while remaining within traffic rules. (See <a href=\"#H7779779\" class=\"local\">'Lights and sirens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children should be restrained during ambulance transport as determined by their medical condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83777\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83777 \">table 9</a>).
