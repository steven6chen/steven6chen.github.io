Breastfeeding for all infants is strongly supported by both governmental and medical professional organizations because of its acknowledged benefits with respect to nutrition, gastrointestinal function, host defense, and psychological well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>]. In addition to these direct short-term benefits, breastfeeding is associated with long-term benefits to the infant and mother. Systematic reviews of the literature have demonstrated multiple benefits of breastfeeding for both the infant and mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The benefits of breastfeeding for the infant will be reviewed here.

Premature infants who receive human milk have a lower incidence of NEC compared with those receiving formula. This lower incidence is observed even if mother's milk is supplemented with formula. The mechanism for the protection from NEC is unclear. However, human milk contains several previously mentioned components that may have protective effects (ie, immunoglobulins A and G, platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase, polyunsaturated fatty acids, EGF, interleukin-10, and intestinal colonization with the favorable microbes of the Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli species).

Maternal plasma cells produce sIgA antibody when the mother is exposed to foreign antigens via her respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. In the mammary gland, sIgA is synthesized by plasma cells in the interstitial spaces of the mammary gland and secreted into milk.

There were no differences between the groups in the likelihood of having &ge;3 episodes of <span class=\"nowrap\">cold/influenza,</span> developing wheezing, or having a first episode of otitis media before one year of age.

These data include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data from the national Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS) and reported that prolonged breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk of overweight among non-Hispanic white children for cumulative breastfeeding for 6 to 12 weeks versus never breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.99), and for breastfeeding for &gt;12 months versus never breastfeeding (adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which cited three systematic reviews and meta-analyses of good to moderate methodological quality, reported an association of breastfeeding with a reduction in the risk of obesity. In this analysis that accounted for confounding factors, the pooled adjusted OR of overweight comparing ever breastfed with never breastfed was 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86), and for obesity, was 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The AHRQ report also referred to an earlier WHO meta-analysis that found increasing duration of breastfeeding was associated with a 4 percent decrease in the risk of overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent Japanese study that used data analyses of a nationwide longitudinal survey from 2001 to 2009 showed that exclusive breastfeeding when compared with formula feeding was associated with a decreased risk of overweight (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.05) and obesity (adjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

This was illustrated by data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of birth hospitals from Belarus of 13,880 subjects, infants delivered at birth hospitals that were randomly selected to provide an educational program promoting exclusive breastfeeding had a higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding at three months of age and of any breastfeeding through one year of age compared with those born at control hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In subsequent publications the (previously randomized) intervention promoting breastfeeding did not prevent overweight or obesity at 11.5 or 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/86,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,88</a>]. However, this study was limited by several factors: 1) it was powered for evaluation of continuation of breastfeeding at three and six months of age, but not for childhood outcomes such as obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>], 2) exclusively formula-fed infants had been excluded from the study, and 3) the study was conducted in an area with a low 5 percent prevalence of obesity (compared with the 17 percent rate in the United States).</p><p>Based on available literature, there appears to be an association between breastfeeding and obesity later in life. The etiology of such a relationship is unclear and the effect may be significant, but small. Nevertheless, even a small magnitude of effect should not be dismissed. Exposure to antibiotics early in life may attenuate the protective effect of breastfeeding, raising the possibility that the effect is mediated by changes in the intestinal microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding has been associated with a reduction in the overall risk of childhood cancer as well as lymphoma and leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/72-74,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74,91</a>]. In a British population based case-control study, breastfeeding was associated with small reduction in the risk of leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, nonhematologic cancers, and all childhood cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A meta-analysis that included 18 case-control studies reported that breastfeeding for six months or more reduces the risk of childhood leukemia by 20 percent (odds ratio [OR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>].

In addition, a follow-up report from the cluster-randomized trial of birth hospitals from Belarus did not demonstrate any difference in cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure; fasting levels of insulin, adiponectin, glucose, and apolipoprotein A1; and risk of metabolic syndrome) at 11.5 years of age between children born at the interventional and control birth centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

With adjustment for potential confounding factors, the mean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Intelligence quotients (IQ) according to duration of breastfeeding were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfed &le;1 month: 99.4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfed &ge;1 to 3 months: 101.7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfed 4 to 6 months: 102.3</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfed 7 to 9 months: 106.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfed &gt;9 months: 104</p><p/><p>In another report based upon the previously mentioned clinical trial from Belarus, cognitive function evaluated by Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence measured at 6.5 years of age was better in the group of children who had a higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding at three months of age and of any breastfeeding through one year of age compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. The average increases in test scores were 7.5 for verbal IQ and 2.9 for performance IQ.</p><p>Similar results were reported from the United Kingdom population-based Millennium Cohort study that reported modest benefits with average increases in the scores in the British Ability Scales tests between two and six points when performed at five years of age for children who were breastfed compared with those who were never breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. In addition, a French study from the ongoing EDEN Mother-Child Cohort Study reported modest gains in language ability and motor function at two to three years of age with longer duration of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>However, it has been challenging to determine whether or not breastfeeding has a positive effect on cognition because of confounding variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. A study that analyzed data from the 1979 United States national longitudinal survey of youth reported that breastfeeding had little or no independent effect on the cognitive ability of offspring when maternal intelligence was controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. However, a subsequent prospective cohort study that adjusted for socioeconomic factors, maternal intelligence, and home environment cognitive stimulation and emotional support, demonstrated that longer breastfeeding duration was associated with higher scores on cognitive testing at three and seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Improved long-term cognitive development in premature infants also has been reported with the receipt of human milk during hospitalization, including in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/112-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-115</a>].</p><p>Improved cognitive function associated with breastfeeding may be due in part to gene-environment interaction. This was illustrated by one study that evaluated IQ and analyzed genetic samples from 3269 participants of two birth cohorts in Great Britain and New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Breastfeeding was associated with a five to six point increase in IQ scores. A polymorphic variant of the FADS2 gene, which is involved with the genetic control of fatty acid pathways, accounted for all the advantages in cognitive function associated with human milk after controlling for confounding variables (eg, intrauterine growth, social class, and maternal cognitive ability). These results suggest that the benefit of breastfeeding upon cognitive function is modulated by variations of a gene involved in the control of fatty acid metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have indicated that human milk-fed term and premature infants have improved visual function compared with formula-fed infants. This benefit has been attributed to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is a component of phospholipids found in brain, retina, and red cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>]. DHA is present in human milk but not in bovine milk. The severity and incidence of retinopathy of prematurity are decreased among breastfed compared with formula-fed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/119-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">119-121</a>]. This association may relate to the substantial antioxidant capacity of human milk compared with formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p>In a study of 109 Inuit full term infants, more optimal visual, cognitive, and motor development was associated with higher cord blood levels of DHA and not with DHA levels in human milk at 11 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. These results support the theory that DHA plays an important role in synaptogenesis of the brain and photoreceptor during the third trimester, and maternal levels of DHA affect the visual function and neurodevelopment of their offspring. In preterm infants without the maternal source of DHA, these findings also support the use of human milk that contains DHA or supplementation of DHA in infants who are formula-fed.
