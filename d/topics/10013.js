Efforts have been made to increase the number of available grafts retrieved by expanding the donor criteria. Such efforts include using donors at the extremes of age, double kidney transplants from marginal donors, extended-criteria donors, and the use of living kidney donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Living kidney donation rates continue to fall, a trend that began in 2003 with a subsequent 15 percent decline to date. While the number of transplants as a result of kidney paired donation (KPD) networks has steadily increased from 19 in 2003 to 228 in 2008 to 525 in 2012, this has not kept pace with the overall decline in living kidney donation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F103311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103311 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This trend is in the presence of a rapidly growing waiting list, longer times to transplant, and very modest increases in deceased donation rates over the past 10 years. Reasons for the decline in living donation (primarily driven by decreases in living related donation) may be due to a number of factors that include an aging transplant candidate population and concurrent medical unsuitability of prospective donors as well as financial disincentives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Kidney donation by biologically unrelated persons has been attempted in different areas of the world, including the Middle and Far East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. These donations have received adverse publicity because of a combination of factors, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unresolved ethical issues including donor payment and possible coercion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unacceptably high donor and recipient morbidity and mortality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor allograft survival rates</p><p/><p>However, such concerns have not materialized in patients accepting kidneys from unrelated donors in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. In addition, donor payment is a federal offense (National Organ Transplant Act, 1984). Living unrelated donors comprise more than 30 percent of all living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>Issues pertaining to living unrelated kidney donation, including donor evaluation and outcome, are reviewed here. A review of general issues pertaining to the kidney donor, whether related or unrelated to the recipient, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ethical considerations surrounding living unrelated organ donation in the United States are somewhat similar to those involved in living related organ donation. Thus far, living unrelated kidney donation has been based upon altruistic ideals and has not been driven by economic incentives; however, some clinicians argue that the debate concerning the sale of kidneys should be reopened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Within the United States, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has regulated the participation of an &quot;independent living donor advocate&quot; (ILDA) into the evaluation of all living donors, whether related, unrelated, or altruistic. One of the primary roles of the ILDA is to ensure that the potential donor is free of coercion from the potential recipient or other involved individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The basic medical evaluation is the same as that for living related donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection of the renal allograft&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The purpose of the evaluation is not to find the &quot;perfect&quot; donor, but to ensure that a potential donor is not jeopardized to an extent beyond the operative risk and does not pose a risk of transmissible infection to the recipient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF DONOR NEPHRECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major concern about living donors is the long-term impact of having a solitary kidney with risk of developing hypertension, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease. Studies suggested that the risk of such complications appears to be quite small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. To better understand these risks, there continue to be calls for the establishment of long-term living-donor registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOGRAFT OUTCOME AFTER KIDNEY DONATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcomes from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched pairing are similar to those of haploidentical relatives. The one-year values are comparable with graft survival rates for recipients of living-related-donor kidneys and better than that with deceased-donor kidneys (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>). This survival benefit with living-unrelated-donor kidneys occurs despite a greater degree of HLA mismatching and an increased rate of acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Long-term graft survival of living-unrelated-donor kidneys is also encouraging. In the 2008 annual report of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, for example, the unadjusted five-year survival of living-unrelated-donor kidneys was the same as that of living-related-donor kidneys (approximately 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since the number of HLA mismatches is similar for spousal donors and the three-to-four HLA-mismatched cadaveric donors, the better results with living donors are best explained by less ischemic injury and the transplantation of &quot;healthier&quot; grafts. Other mechanisms that have been thought to contribute include improved patient compliance with immunosuppressive medications, less susceptibility to underlying kidney disorders (particularly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and diabetes mellitus), and possible tolerance to spousal antigens by sexual contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the last hypothesis seems unlikely since recipients of living-unrelated-donor kidneys experience a similar number of acute rejection episodes and require as much immunosuppressive therapy as recipients of living related grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPANSION OF LIVING UNRELATED DONOR POOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been multiple efforts to expand the number of living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. One method is the establishment of kidney paired donation (KPD) programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In this system, living donors who are incompatible with their intended recipients either because of ABO incompatibility or because of sensitization (leading to a positive crossmatch) participate in a &quot;donor pool,&quot; resulting in an expanded availability of organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The development of a national paired kidney exchange pilot program is underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), operated under federal contract by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), is coordinating the project, although limited numbers of transplants have resulted thus far.</p><p>Another strategy is to consider a nondirected live kidney donor (sometimes referred to as altruistic donors). These individuals offer to donate a kidney, but do not identify the specific recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. A 2002 United States national conference report was published outlining some ethical and practical guidelines for centers considering the use of kidneys from a nondirected live kidney donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In the 2005 Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients Report, there were 88 nondirected donations (among a total of 2343 living unrelated donors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Perhaps the most exciting development is the realization that an altruistic donor can trigger an open-ended chain of transplants.</p><p>Some regions of the UNOS region have also instituted a system where a person waiting for a deceased-donor kidney is given a higher priority if a living relative donates a kidney to another recipient, resulting in the patient coming off the waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. This practice, however, may harm standard blood type O waiting-list candidates if ABO-incompatible donor-recipient pairs are allowed to participate.</p><p>An increase in living donation rates, whether living related or unrelated, may also occur if patient education is improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one study, 122 patients were randomly assigned to clinic-based education alone or clinic-based plus home-based education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The combined program resulted in significantly more living kidney donor transplantations (52 versus 30 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537059496\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY PAIRED DONATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 percent of live donors are incompatible with their intended recipients either because of ABO differences or the presence of preformed donor reactive antibody. Kidney paired donation (KPD) offers the best option for many such individuals and has grown to account for over 7 percent of live-donor transplants within the United States. KPD is currently administered through a variety of local, regional, and national initiatives. Some local KPD programs have been remarkably successful. For example, one study reported 134 KPD transplants performed over a three-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Of the sensitized recipients transplanted by paired donation, 44 percent had calculated panel reactive antibody levels greater than 80 percent.</p><p>The National Kidney Registry is a nonprofit organization charged with increasing the quality, speed, and number of living-donor transplants in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The National Kidney Registry has facilitated more than 600 transplants since 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One study of the National Kidney Registry data reported the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forty-four incompatible <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> pairs were entered into KPD that enabled 50 transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 80 percent of candidates were transplanted after 157 days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourteen candidates on the deceased-donor waiting list also received transplants.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than half of the kidneys were received from other transplant centers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed graft function<em> </em>occurred in 6 percent; the one-year rejection rate was 9.1 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-year patient and graft survivals were 98.0 and 94.8 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p>Another study reported on the first 54 chains that facilitated 272 kidney transplants, all via the National Kidney Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Seven chains ended because potential donors became unavailable to donate after their recipient received a kidney; however, every recipient whose intended donor donated was transplanted. The remaining 47 chains were eventually closed by having the last donor donate to the waiting list. Of the 272 chain recipients, 46 percent were ethnic minorities and 63 percent of grafts were shipped from other centers. The number of blood type O patients receiving a transplant was greater than the number of blood type O nondirected donors initiating chains. The mean one-year creatinine of the first 100 transplants from this series was 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Such results are most reassuring.</p><p>A single, national KPD system has been proposed that adheres to a set of clinical and ethical standards determined by a consensus of stakeholders including recipients, donors, providers, payers, and the United States federal government [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Proposed key features include the need for uniform tissue-typing algorithms, computerized matching programs, development of a single administrative structure, and a standardized organ acquisition charges. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) continues to develop its national KPD pilot program, although its success has been dwarfed by competing initiatives.</p><p>One of the barriers impeding widespread implementation of KPD is financial. Analogous to the recovery of deceased-donor kidneys, KPD requires the evaluation of living donors before identifying their recipient. Tissue typing, crossmatching, administrative, and transportation charges represent additional financial challenges. A Medicare Demonstration Project has been proposed to develop a standard acquisition charge for KPD analogous to the proven strategy used for over 30 years to pay for deceased-donor solid organ transplantation in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A new payment strategy is required because Medicare and commercial insurance companies may not directly pay living-donor costs intended to lead to transplantation of a beneficiary of a different insurance provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
