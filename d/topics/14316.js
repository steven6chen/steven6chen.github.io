Affected patients are more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections but have a normal resistance to viral infections. Most are diagnosed in infancy due to the severity of the infection or the unusual presentation of the organism, but some escape diagnosis until adulthood.</p><p>This topic review provides a brief overview of the types of defects and typical presentation of primary phagocytic disorders. The major disorders resulting from defects of phagocytic function are also briefly discussed. (Detailed discussions of these disorders are presented separately. See links in respective sections below.)</p><p>A detailed discussion of methods used in the evaluation of immune system function is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF DEFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phagocytic disorders may be divided into extrinsic and intrinsic defects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrinsic defects include opsonic abnormalities secondary to deficiencies of antibody and complement factors. Extrinsic factors may lead to neutropenia by suppression of granulocyte production or cause a decrease in the number of circulating neutrophils via leukocyte autoantibodies or isoantibodies directed against neutrophil antigens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic disorders of granulocytes may be divided into those that result from defects in granulocyte development or exit into the circulation (primary neutropenias), granulocyte killing ability, or chemotaxis (cell movement). Intrinsic disorders of phagocytic killing ability include chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), glycogen storage disease type Ib, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), and specific granule deficiency (SGD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Intrinsic disorders of chemotaxis include hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) due to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<em>STAT3</em>) mutations, leukocyte adhesion defects, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), and syndromes with periodontitis. Defects of phagocytic movement may also occur secondary to diabetes mellitus, metabolic storage disease, malnutrition, immaturity, and burns.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18781392\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary phagocytic deficiencies characteristically lead to recurrent and severe fungal (eg, <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em>) and bacterial (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, <em>Salmonella typhi</em>) infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Response to nontuberculous mycobacteria may also be abnormal, particularly in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). The most common sites of infection are the respiratory tract and skin. Tissue and organ abscesses also occur. Other frequent manifestations include abnormal wound healing, <span class=\"nowrap\">dermatitis/eczema,</span> and stomatitis. Many patients have growth failure. Other findings are unique to each disorder, including granuloma formation with CGD, heart defects and neurologic deficits with certain mutations causing severe congenital neutropenia, and oculocutaneous albinism with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUTROPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutropenia (eg, circulating neutrophils &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm)</span> is associated with a number of primary disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These include infantile agranulocytosis (Kostmann syndrome and various other forms of severe chronic neutropenia), cyclic neutropenia, glycogen storage disease type Ib, and myelokathexis or failure of release of neutrophils from the marrow. Neutropenia is also common in several primary immunodeficiencies that also affect lymphoid cells, including X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, and reticular dysgenesis. Acquired autoimmune and isoimmune neutropenias result from antibodies directed against neutrophils. Alloimmune or isoimmune neutropenia in infants is caused by transplacental passage of maternal antineutrophil antibodies. Increased neutrophil destruction is also common in chronic splenomegaly from any cause and certain autoimmune diseases (eg, Felty's syndrome, lupus erythematosus).</p><p>Further discussion of neutropenia appears separately.

It is characterized by recurrent, life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and granulomata formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CGD is caused by defects in phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (phox). These genetic defects result in the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) to destroy microbial organisms once phagocytosed. The diagnosis is made by neutrophil function testing and mutation analysis. The cornerstones of CGD management are early diagnosis of infections, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory prophylaxis, and aggressive management of infectious complications. Survival of patients with CGD has dramatically improved, with many now living well into middle age.</p><p>CGD is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) type I results from an inability of neutrophils to leave the circulation in response to infection due to mutation of the leukocyte integrin beta2 (CD18). Patients may present with delayed separation of the umbilical cord, recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary and skin infections, and poor wound healing. Circulating neutrophils may reach levels as high as <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> during infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>LAD type II results from an inability to appropriately glycosylate the leukocyte adhesion molecule sialyl-Lewis-X (sLeX or CD15s) due to a defect in a fucose transferase enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, the disorder is also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation 2c. Patients with LAD type II have small stature, abnormal facies, and severe cognitive impairment. Recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary and skin infections are characteristic, although less severe than that observed with type 1 disease. Some patients may respond to treatment with high-dose fucose supplementation.</p><p>LAD type III is characterized by severe infections and a thromboasthenia-like bleeding disorder. It is caused by mutations of the fermitin family (drosophila) homolog 3 (<em>FERMT3</em>) gene, leading to impaired activation of beta-integrins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These disorders are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

HIES type 1 is caused by dominant-negative mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<em>STAT3</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

It catalyzes the production of microbicidal hypohalous acid in the presence of halide ions and hydrogen peroxide. The overwhelming majority of patients with MPO deficiency are clinically normal, even though this enzyme drives an important cytotoxic system capable of killing bacteria, fungi, parasites, and tumor cells.

At least one defective gene has been identified, the CCAAT <span class=\"nowrap\">(cytosine-cytosine-adenine-adenine-thymine)/enhancer-binding</span> protein epsilon <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/EBP-epsilon)</span> gene. The diagnosis is made by examining neutrophils in a peripheral blood smear for the pathognomonic laboratory findings of paucity or absence of specific granules and predominantly bilobed nuclei (pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly).

Manifestations include meningoencephalitis and invasive brain infections due to <em>Candida</em> species, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, disseminated infections with <em>Exophiala</em> and <em>Phialophora</em> species, superficial (cutaneous) dermatophytosis, and deep dermatophytosis with involvement of the skin, scalp, nails, lymph nodes, and brain. Multifocal-to-coalescing granulomatous dermatitis is seen on skin biopsy in patients with deep dermatophytosis. CARD9 levels (measured by flow cytometry) in monocyte-derived dendritic cells are low to absent, depending upon the specific mutation.
