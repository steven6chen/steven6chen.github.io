A frequent clinical question is whether these patients can safely receive the structurally related cephalosporins or carbapenems (monobactams [ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>] are not cross-reactive with penicillins and can be safely given to penicillin-allergic patients). This topic will present an approach to determining whether a patient with reported penicillin allergy can be treated with penicillins or related beta-lactam antibiotics, with or without access to allergy consultation. It is focused on the hospitalized patient but applies to ambulatory patients as well. The detailed allergy evaluation of a patient with past penicillin reaction based upon penicillin skin testing and studies of cross-reactivity among beta-lactam antibiotics are reviewed elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-evaluation-for-immediate-penicillin-allergy-skin-test-based-diagnostic-strategies-and-cross-reactivity-with-other-beta-lactam-antibiotics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy evaluation for immediate penicillin allergy: Skin test-based diagnostic strategies and cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Penicillin allergy (immediate and delayed), penicillin skin testing techniques, and rapid drug desensitization are reviewed in more detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Delayed hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H889002390\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY ON CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is morbidity, mortality, and economic cost associated with the unnecessary withholding of penicillins in patients who are labeled as allergic on the basis of history alone. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy are more likely to be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as quinolones or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. There are distinct disadvantages to broad-spectrum agents, which are often more expensive, associated with more side effects (such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection), and less effective for some infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/6,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-13</a>].

However, access to an allergy and immunology consult service is often lacking. This topic presents an evidence-based, pragmatic approach, which permits a large majority of patients labeled as penicillin-allergic to receive related beta-lactam antibiotics with minimal risk of acute allergic reactions, without the necessity of allergy consultations. The approach is based on categorization of the past reaction and for those patients with possible immediate (eg, immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated) allergy, an assessment of the risk of a recurrent immediate reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112936\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112936 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, if an allergy specialist is available, consultation is strongly encouraged, especially when the algorithm suggests penicillin skin testing.

It is useful to name the various commonly used penicillins (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, specific brand names), as patients may recognize a common brand name but not realize it is a penicillin. It is also worthwhile to ask if the patient has avoided penicillins since the reaction, because in some cases, patients had been given a penicillin again despite a reported allergy, and if it was tolerated, then the patient is not allergic to penicillins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1095441473\"><span class=\"h3\">Important questions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important questions in a drug allergy history include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112936\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112936 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p>1. What exactly were the symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raised, red, itchy spots with each lesion lasting less than 24 hours <span class=\"nowrap\">(hives/urticaria)?</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the mouth, eyes, lips, or tongue (angioedema)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blisters or ulcers involving the lips, mouth, eyes, urethra, vagina, or peeling skin (seen in Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS], toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN], other severe type IV reactions)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory or hemodynamic changes (anaphylaxis)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pains (seen in serum sickness)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the reaction involve organs like the kidneys, lungs, or liver (seen in drug rash eosinophilia systemic symptoms [DRESS, also known as, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [DiHS]), other severe type IV reactions)?</p><p/><p>2. What was the timing of the reaction after taking penicillin: Minutes, hours, or days later? Did it begin after the first dose or after multiple doses? The rapid onset of symptoms (ie, within minutes to hours) after the first dose distinguishes immediate from delayed reactions.</p><p>3. How long ago did the reaction happen? This question is most important for immediate reactions, because patients may lose the sensitivity with time if they have no further penicillin exposures. Specifically, studies have shown that if patients with immediate penicillin allergy that was confirmed by skin testing are retested after 10 years of penicillin avoidance, only approximately 20 percent will still have positive skin tests, while the allergy will have resolved in 80 percent. The relevant studies demonstrating loss of immediate allergy are reviewed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions#H1968145\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;, section on 'Time elapsed since the reaction'</a>). In contrast, the natural history of serious delayed reactions is not as well-studied.</p><p>4. How was the reaction treated? Was epinephrine (adrenaline) administered to suggest anaphylaxis? Was there a need for urgent care or hospitalization?</p><p>5. Has the patient tolerated similar medications, such as a cephalosporin <strong>since</strong> the initial penicillin reaction? This information can be very helpful. The information that can be deduced from various answers is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions#H1124530506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;, section on 'Exposure to related medications since the initial reaction'</a>.)</p><p>A more detailed discussion of taking a drug allergy history is found separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2389288903\" class=\"local\">'Management of reactions WITH features of immediate allergy (some risk)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Immediate reactions typically involve some combination of pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension, although an array of other symptoms may occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>). These reactions usually occur within minutes to one hour or two of initial administration, beginning somewhat later for oral compared with intravenous medications. The most severe form of an immediate reaction is anaphylaxis. Patients with past anaphylaxis may report that they &quot;could not breathe,&quot; &quot;swelled up,&quot; or &quot;almost died,&quot; and most patients would have required acute medical care. For the beta-lactam drugs, most immediate reactions are IgE-mediated, and the terms &quot;IgE-mediated&quot; and &quot;immediate&quot; are used interchangeably throughout this topic review. The clinical manifestations of immediate reactions to penicillins are reviewed in greater detail separately.

It should be explained to the patient that this is not an allergy, and penicillin allergy should be removed from the medical record or clarified to indicate that there was a side effect or intolerance. Patients with nonallergic reactions to penicillin can receive penicillins and related medications normally, although steps should be taken to avoid the specific agent that caused the previous adverse effect or to mitigate that adverse effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2576390306\"><span class=\"h4\">Family history of penicillin allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other patients may never have actually taken penicillins, but are avoiding them because one or more family members has penicillin allergy. However, penicillin allergy is not a heritable trait, and family history is not a reason to avoid penicillin.

Patients reporting these symptoms are at some risk for future immediate allergic reactions.

However, if this is not possible, clinicians must attempt to identify those patients whose history suggests a past immediate reaction that was serious. The best designed cross-reactivity studies suggest that, among patients with skin test-confirmed penicillin allergy, 97 to 98 percent of patients tolerate a cephalosporin. However, an important limitation of these studies, which are nearly all retrospective, is the selection bias arising from the probable exclusion of patients with the most serious past reactions by the clinicians treating them at the time.</p><p>Options for treating such patients include the following (if appropriate for the infection in question):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin or carbapenems <strong>using a test dose procedure</strong>.

(See <a href=\"#H3959809196\" class=\"local\">'Role of the allergy specialist'</a> below.)</p><p>An allergy evaluation should be pursed if a penicillin or a first- or second-generation cephalosporin is indicated or superior to other antibiotics. Either penicillin skin testing can be performed or the patient could be assumed to be allergic and receive a penicillin through an empiric (because the patient's allergy status is unknown) desensitization protocol or receive a first-generation cephalosporin via graded challenge or empiric desensitization. An infectious diseases consult may also be helpful to explore efficacy of different antibiotic options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2250300885\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of patients with vague histories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with past drug eruptions often cannot recall enough detail for the interviewer to make a judgment about the nature of the skin lesions (hives versus other). It is important to ascertain that the skin eruption did not blister or peel or involve mucosal surfaces, and these are characteristics that patients generally remember. We consider reactions that are too vague to characterize as carrying some risk of a future immediate reaction. This risk is lower if the past reaction was (possible) isolated hives without other symptoms and occurred &gt;10 years ago. Some experts would consider such a patient to be at minimal risk and manage them accordingly, but this requires clinical judgement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2132435027\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety and impact of proposed approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A guideline nearly identical to the approach advocated in this topic was implemented at one author's (KB) practice site (an academic tertiary care referral center) for hospitalized adults reporting a penicillin allergy who would benefit from treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Test doses, when indicated, were administered by the medical team, whereas prior to implementation of the guideline, all challenges had required allergy consultation. Allergy consultation was obtained if a penicillin or first- or second-generation cephalosporin was desired in a patient with possible immediate allergy, and the patient was skin tested to penicillin (with results guiding therapy).</p><p>The incidence of adverse drug reactions did not increase significantly after implementation, compared with the pre-guideline period, suggesting that test dosing can be safely performed by the general medical staff with proper guidance. After implementation, there were statistically significant reductions in the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. When replicated at another institution on internal medicine inpatients, the guideline resulted in an almost twofold increase in use of favorable (ie, not antibiotic stewardship-restricted) penicillins and cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Based upon this initial success, the guideline was applied across a larger health care system, comprised of two academic tertiary care referral centers and three community teaching hospitals. Sites without access to <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> and penicillin skin testing either used empiric desensitization (ie, empiric because the patient's current sensitization status was not known) or an alternative antibiotic for inpatients with outpatient <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> follow-up for skin testing. Test dosing was performed similarly at all sites by nonallergist providers. Since guideline implementation, over 1000 test doses have been performed without any identified safety risks. Data collection on specific outcomes of this approach is in progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959809196\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE ALLERGY SPECIALIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an allergy specialist is available, consultation is strongly encouraged for suspected immediate allergy, with the urgency depending upon the clinical scenario. Allergists (or other specifically trained clinicians) can perform penicillin skin testing to determine with certainty if the patient has an immediate penicillin allergy, which simplifies future management and may further reduce the use of broader-spectrum agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4201028194\"><span class=\"h2\">Penicillin skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin skin testing reagents are commercially available in many countries. The performance of skin testing is encouraged because it greatly simplifies future antibiotic choices for that patient and can reduce the use of broader-spectrum agents. The reason for this is that the vast majority of patients turn out to be penicillin skin test-negative, and by virtue of ruling out penicillin allergy, they are able to receive any and all beta-lactams antibiotics safely, provided they have not also reacted to cephalosporins. Penicillin skin testing is only validated in patients with past immediate reactions to a penicillin and should not be used to screen patients who have never reacted to a penicillin.</p><p>Skin testing takes about one hour to perform, and the results are immediately available. It can be safely performed in pregnant women and critically-ill patients when necessary. Skin testing is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3050330039\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of proactive allergy evaluation in advance of acute need</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several groups have evaluated the impact of allergy evaluation with penicillin skin testing or <span class=\"nowrap\">guidelines/algorithms</span> to address the use of related antibiotics in patients reporting penicillin allergy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F111029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111029 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/31,35-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35-56</a>]. Studies performed testing in the hospital either when the need for penicillin arose or when less appropriate antibiotics were being used. None of these studies are randomized, many are subject to selection bias, and few have a control group or control for baseline patient differences between groups. Longer-term cost savings are more difficult to assess, as complications, suboptimal care, and antibiotic resistance would need to be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2210135731\"><span class=\"h1\">TEST DOSE PROCEDURE (GRADED CHALLENGE)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362639655\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Test doses (also called graded challenges) are indicated to exclude immediate allergic reactions. Test dosing is appropriate <strong>only when immediate allergy to the tested antibiotic is judged to be unlikely after careful consideration of the details of the history</strong>. Test doses may be administered by an allergy specialist (preferable) or a member of the general medical team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The purpose of a test dose is to expose the patient to a small amount of drug, followed by a period of close observation, in case there is a reaction.</p><p>Because graded challenges <strong>will not prevent</strong> <strong>or circumvent an immediate allergic reaction</strong>, the clinician must be prepared to recognize and treat such a reaction if one occurs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diphenhydramine</a> (oral and intravenous) and epinephrine (intramuscular) should be at the bedside. If a fixed dose epinephrine autoinjector is not being used, the appropriate concentration and dose of intramuscular epinephrine for that patient should be calculated in advance so that there are no delays or dosing errors if epinephrine is needed. Proper dosing of epinephrine in anaphylaxis is described in the tables for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 3</a>) and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>When test doses are given, patients are usually <strong>not</strong> pretreated with antihistamines or glucocorticoids, because antihistamines may mask early signs of an allergic reaction. However, if a patient is already receiving a daily antihistamine for allergic rhinitis or another disorder, it is not necessary to withhold it. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking medications should be withheld for 24 hours before the first dose, if feasible, as these medications can interfere with treatment of anaphylaxis, should a reaction occur. Patients with asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or other chronic pulmonary diseases should be optimally controlled prior to undergoing challenge.</p><p>At one author's (KB) institution, test doses of beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitalized patients are ordered by any clinical provider using a protocol and administered by a nurse with a one-to-one nursing assignment for the challenge duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The patient is assessed for symptoms, and vital signs are recorded every 30 minutes. More information about graded challenges, including interpretation of subjective symptoms, is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions#H347080377\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;, section on 'Graded challenge (test dosing)'</a>.)</p><p>The starting dose is usually <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10<sup>th</sup></span> of the full dose, but could be higher or lower, depending on the route of administration, clinical stability of the patient, and level of certainty that the patient is not allergic to the drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1335796405\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, an intravenous test dose can be <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10<sup>th</sup></span> (10 percent) of the final dose.

(See <a href=\"#H889002390\" class=\"local\">'Impact of penicillin allergy on care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a patient with a reported penicillin allergy begins with a detailed history of the past reaction and a review of any relevant medical records. The intent of these steps is categorization of the patient's past penicillin reaction and identification of serious past reactions, particularly immediate, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions and serious forms of non-immediate (delayed) reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or drug-induced organ damage or cytopenias. (See <a href=\"#H4057945975\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for each group of patients are shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112936\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112936 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some patients, the past adverse reaction to a penicillin was clearly not allergic in nature, and beta-lactam antibiotics can be given normally. However, the adverse reaction may recur if the identical agent is used, so clinicians should be mindful of this. (See <a href=\"#H225954583\" class=\"local\">'Reactions that are not allergic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In other patients, there is a convincing history of a serious type of delayed reaction, and these individuals should continue to avoid all beta-lactam antibiotics unless the details of the case are evaluated by an allergist or other clinician with expertise in the suspected type of reaction and it is deemed safe to use a related antibiotic. (See <a href=\"#H2019656230\" class=\"local\">'Possible serious delayed reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Many patients will report mild past reactions that lacked clear features of IgE-mediated reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>). These individuals can be considered at minimal risk for future serious immediate reactions to beta-lactams and can receive third- or higher-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a> normally (without prior penicillin skin testing). However, because the clinical history can be unreliable, some caution with penicillins and first- and second-generation cephalosporins is still warranted, and these should be given using a test dose procedure. Another approach is to refer such patients to an allergist for penicillin skin testing, which will conclusively determine if the patient has an immediate penicillin allergy and simplify future management. (See <a href=\"#H4106353025\" class=\"local\">'Management of mild reactions WITHOUT history of features of immediate allergy (minimal risk of immediate allergy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who describe past reactions with features of IgE-mediated allergy are at some risk for similar reactions in the future, and the risk is greatest in patients with severe and recent reactions. We also consider patients to be at risk if the history is too vague to categorize (eg, the clinician cannot tell if skin lesions were hives or something else). A more cautious approach is warranted for this group of patients: Third- and higher-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems can be given using a test dose procedure. If a penicillin or a first- or second-generation cephalosporin is strongly indicated, infectious diseases and allergy specialists should be consulted to confirm the need for these antibiotics and safe administration, respectively. Penicillin skin testing can be performed to clarify the patient's status or the patient can be assumed to be allergic and receive a penicillin or early-generation cephalosporin using a rapid &quot;desensitization&quot; protocol.

Skin testing takes one to three hours to perform and should be done by specifically trained personnel.
