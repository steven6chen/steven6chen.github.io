This means they are thinner and more fragile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53181 \">figure 1</a>). Over time, this can lead to a disorder called osteoporosis, which makes bones weak. People who have osteoporosis have bones that can break too easily. For example, people with osteoporosis sometimes break a bone just from falling down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832146\"><span class=\"h1\">What is bone density testing used for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do bone density testing for 2 reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To see if a person has osteoporosis or is at risk for it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To see if treatments for osteoporosis are working </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832153\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should get bone density testing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women age 65 and older should have bone density testing at least once. Bone density testing might also be appropriate for some men who are older than 70. Doctors sometimes check bone density in men and women who are younger than this if they are at high risk for breaking a bone. Things that increase your risk of breaking a bone include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having already broken a bone as an adult</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines called steroids for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weighing less than 127 pounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having rheumatoid arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a parent who broke a hip after a minor injury</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832160\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of bone density tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The different types of bone density tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)</strong> &ndash; This is the most useful and reliable bone density test. It is a special kind of X-ray that gives off very little radiation. DXA gives reliable measures of bone density in different parts of the body, such as the spine, hip, and wrist. DXA is the best test to diagnose osteoporosis, predict the chances that you will break a bone, and check how well treatment is working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quantitative computerized tomography (CT)</strong> &ndash; This is another special kind of X-ray. It gives reliable measurements of bone density in the spine. It gives off more radiation than DXA. Doctors don't use this test to diagnose osteoporosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound testing</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound can be used to measure the bone density of the heel. This test can help find out a person's risk of breaking a bone. But doctors don't use this test to diagnose osteoporosis or to follow changes in bone density over time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832167\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a DXA test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During DXA, you lie on a table. Then an X-ray machine scans one of your bones. The test doesn't hurt or make you uncomfortable. You don't need to take any pills or get any shots. The whole thing takes 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p>Even though DXA is a type of X-ray, it gives off very little radiation. During a DXA you get about the same amount of radiation that an average person gets from the environment in one day. After the test, your bones get a &quot;score.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832174\"><span class=\"h1\">What do the results mean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of a bone density test are called &quot;T&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; scores. For men age 50 and older and for women who have gone through menopause (meaning they no longer have monthly periods), the T-score is more important.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal bone density</strong> &ndash; People with normal bone density have a T-score between +1 and -1. People who have a score in this range do not usually need treatment. Still, it makes sense for them do things to prevent bone loss. For instance, they should eat foods rich in calcium and vitamin D, and do exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteopenia</strong> (also known as low bone mass) &ndash; Osteopenia is the medical term for bone density that is lower than normal but not as low as it gets with osteoporosis. A person with osteopenia does not yet have osteoporosis but is at risk of developing it. People with osteopenia have a T-score between -1.1 and -2.4. They usually need to do things to prevent bone loss. Sometimes that means taking medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteoporosis</strong> &ndash; People with osteoporosis have a T-score of -2.5 or less. If you discover that you have osteoporosis, there are lots of things you can do to lower the chances that you will break a bone. For instance, you can take osteoporosis medicines and calcium and vitamin D supplements. You can also exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832181\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to have bone density testing again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your test shows that you do not have osteoporosis today, you might need to have the test again later. Ask your doctor or nurse if and when you should be tested again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27832203\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-bone-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Paget disease of bone (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
