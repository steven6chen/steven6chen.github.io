Gastrointestinal manifestations are relatively rare in the setting of reactivation of chronic <em>T. cruzi</em> infection among organ transplant recipients or in patients with HIV infection, although there are reports of parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, intestine, stomach, esophagus, or larynx. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-in-the-immunosuppressed-host\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease in the immunosuppressed host&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The likelihood of digestive involvement may vary by region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The digestive form is observed more frequently in the countries of the Southern Cone of South America and is rare in northern South America, Central America, and Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A high prevalence has been observed in the central region of Brazil. This geographic pattern is thought to be due to distribution of different <em>T. cruzi</em> genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The mortality associated with Chagas gastrointestinal disease is low, but symptoms can have a considerable impact on quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86302856\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both parasite and host factors are thought to influence the development of gastrointestinal manifestations and the severity of disease. Molecular techniques have demonstrated the presence of parasite DNA in digestive tissues, which correlates with inflammatory infiltrate and degree of denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The parasite burden likely influences the degree of inflammation and progression of disease. In addition to parasite-dependent inflammation, there is an immune-mediated tissue injury resulting from cross-reactivity between parasite antigens and enteric neuron surface proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Moreover, the occurrence of the gastrointestinal manifestations in certain geographical areas has been attributed to variations in parasite strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of disease consists of destruction of the neurons of the enteric nervous system. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are involved, and denervation occurs in both the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexuses. A significant reduction in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal has been demonstrated; these cells play an important role in the modulation of digestive tube motility.</p><p>Histologically, neuronal reduction and focal areas of fibrosis in the smooth muscle and myenteric plexuses have been described, along with lymphocytic infiltrates at the submucosal, myenteric plexus, and smooth muscle levels. In addition, the muscularis mucosa can become hypertrophic, likely a compensatory mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Denervation occurs to variable degrees; it is irregular and noncontinuous. The esophagus and the distal colon are the most frequently involved segments.</p><p>The digestive form of Chagas disease is characterized by alterations in the motor, secretory, and absorptive functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Uncoordinated motor activity of the sphincters occurs as a result of denervation. In the esophagus, there is hypercontractility and increased muscular tone, and often there is failure of sphincter relaxation with swallowing. In the large intestine, there is abnormal basal colonic motility and impaired relaxation of the anal sphincter. Progressive dilation of the esophagus and colon occurs, with reduction of contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86302863\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, dysphagia and retrosternal pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea) can occur during the acute phase of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, significant gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease are mainly associated with the chronic phase of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-chronic-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1338571713\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease onset and progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms is most common between the ages of 20 and 40 years but can occur earlier. Any part of the digestive system may be affected; the esophagus and colon (particularly the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon) are the most frequently involved sites. Esophageal involvement is more common than colonic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. Disease progression is usually slow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86302870\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal manifestations of Chagas disease are similar to patients with idiopathic achalasia. Patients with minor motility abnormalities may be asymptomatic but develop progressive dysphagia and regurgitation due to neuronal loss. Dysphagia occurs initially with solids but eventually also develops with liquids. Affected patients eat more slowly and often adopt specific maneuvers such as lifting the neck or throwing the shoulders back in order to enhance esophageal emptying. Regurgitation of bland undigested food or saliva is common and, in severe cases, may result in aspiration. As the disease progresses, food may become lodged in the esophagus and cause retrosternal pain due to local irritation, ulceration, bleeding, perforation, and fistulas. In end-stage disease, malnutrition can develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with megaesophagus also have an increased risk of esophageal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H198500171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86302877\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonic involvement of Chagas disease results in progressive dilation. The sigmoid colon is dilated and elongated in nearly all cases of megacolon; the rectum is involved in 80 percent of cases. Dilation of more proximal colonic segments is rare. Patients usually present with slowly progressive constipation. As the disease progresses, patients may report several weeks between bowel movements. This may be accompanied by bloating and, less often, colicky abdominal pain. In a minority of patients, prolonged stool retention can lead to fecalith formation. Patients usually have mild abdominal discomfort or rectal fullness and can be diagnosed by abdominal palpation and rectal examination. Fecaloma-associated stercoral ulceration can occur, and overflow diarrhea can result from fecal retention. In rare cases, pseudo-obstruction results and volvulus can lead to secondary bowel ischemia. Anorexia and malnutrition can also develop.</p><p>The prevalence of megacolon is not known because of diagnostic difficulties in remote areas. Symptoms may be absent in 25 to 30 percent of individuals with radiographic evidence of colonic dilatation. Most cases of megacolon are associated with megaesophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An increased frequency of colorectal cancer has not been reported in patients with megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86302884\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other parts of the digestive tract can be involved, including the stomach, small bowel, biliary tree, and salivary glands. However, symptoms secondary to involvement of these organs is rare.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stomach</strong> &ndash; Approximately 20 percent of patients with megaesophagus have gastric involvement. Gastric manifestations may include altered myoelectrical activity (gastric dysrhythmias), alterations in gastric emptying, distension, hypoperistalsis, hypochlorhydria, and eventually pyloric hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small intestine</strong> &ndash; Involvement of the small bowel (Chagas enteropathy) has also been reported, with or without dilatation. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal Chagas disease include dysphagia, odynophagia, regurgitation, progressive constipation, or its complications (eg, sigmoid volvulus and bowel ischemia). There is no diagnostic test to establish gastrointestinal involvement of Chagas disease. A presumptive diagnosis of Chagas disease can be made in patients with motor abnormalities that are consistent with Chagas disease and positive laboratory diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease. Issues related to laboratory diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is discussed in detail separately.

Asymptomatic patients with no gastrointestinal tract symptoms do not require further gastrointestinal evaluation; they should be reassessed for the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms annually. Each year, approximately 2 percent of patients develop clinical manifestations of the disease; there are no known markers of disease progression. Symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal Chagas disease include dysphagia, odynophagia, regurgitation, progressive constipation, or its complications (eg, sigmoid volvulus and bowel ischemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, dysphagia, odynophagia, regurgitation), we perform esophageal manometry and a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagram.

Transient gastrointestinal symptoms can occur during the acute phase of infection. However, significant gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease are mainly associated with the chronic phase of infection. The likelihood of digestive involvement may vary by geographic region. (See <a href=\"#H86302849\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3660898\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of disease consists of destruction of the neurons of the enteric nervous system. Uncoordinated motor activity of the sphincters occurs as a result of denervation. In the esophagus, there is hypercontractility and increased muscular tone, and often there is failure of sphincter relaxation with swallowing. In the large intestine, there is abnormal basal colonic motility and impaired relaxation of the anal sphincter. (See <a href=\"#H86302856\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of symptoms is most common between the ages of 20 and 40 years but can occur earlier. Any part of the digestive system may be affected; the esophagus and colon (particularly the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon) are the most frequently involved sites. Clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal Chagas disease include dysphagia, odynophagia, regurgitation, progressive constipation, and its complications (eg, sigmoid volvulus and bowel ischemia). (See <a href=\"#H86302863\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a diagnosis of chronic <em>T. cruzi</em> infection by serologic testing should be assessed for the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Evaluation for gastrointestinal involvement should be limited to patients with symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal Chagas disease. There is no diagnostic test to establish gastrointestinal involvement of Chagas disease. The tests performed for evaluation of gastrointestinal involvement of Chagas disease can diagnose motor abnormalities that are consistent but not specific to Chagas disease. (See <a href=\"#H2484257630\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for gastrointestinal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with symptoms suggestive of upper gastrointestinal Chagas (eg, dysphagia, odynophagia, regurgitation), we perform esophageal manometry and a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagram. In addition, we perform an upper endoscopy to exclude a malignancy at the esophagogastric junction that can mimic Chagas disease. In patients with lower gastrointestinal symptoms, evaluation for colonic involvement due to Chagas disease consists of contrast-enhanced imaging (eg, computed tomography scan or barium enema) and anorectal manometry. In addition, we perform a colonoscopy to exclude a mechanical obstruction and complications associated with megacolon. (See <a href=\"#H4144827959\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-chronic-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection#H1462222214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no data to support that treatment with antitrypanosomal drugs affects progression of digestive Chagas disease. We suggest NOT administering antitrypanosomal therapy for patients with Chagas gastrointestinal disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); management focuses on symptom amelioration.
