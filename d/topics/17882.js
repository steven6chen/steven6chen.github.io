The main clinical manifestations of Paget disease are pain and deformities in affected areas and a heightened risk of fracture. Osteoarthritis in proximal joints and neurologic disease are also common complications; high-output heart failure and abnormalities in calcium and phosphate balance are unusual, and osteosarcomas arising in pagetic bone are rare. Because of the vascularity of pagetic bone, excessive bleeding may occur during orthopaedic surgery on pagetic bone.</p><p>Many patients with Paget disease of bone are asymptomatic. The diagnosis in such patients is usually made incidentally following a routine chemistry screen showing an elevated serum concentration of alkaline phosphatase of bone origin, or by an imaging study obtained for some other reason that shows pagetic changes in bone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with Paget disease, the newer generations of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can ease pain, slow bone turnover, and promote deposition of normal lamellar bone, which in turn results over time in the normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase and other markers of bone turnover (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Use of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates'</a> below). Effective therapy may also lead to radiographic healing of lytic lesions and a lessening of increased isotope uptake on bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Analgesic, rehabilitative, surgical, and other measures may also be of benefit.</p><p>The treatment of Paget disease of bone will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS AND INDICATIONS FOR THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment are to ease pain and to reduce the rate of bone remodeling toward normal, which will enhance the deposition of normal lamellar bone, decrease the vascularity of bone, and slow disease progression. Treatment is indicated in patients with symptomatic Paget disease and in selected asymptomatic patients with significant biochemical abnormalities or imaging changes indicating risk of complications from untreated disease.

(See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Retreatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Life expectancy, which may be difficult to predict, should only be a limited consideration in decisions to treat. Age alone is generally not a factor, as the newer bisphosphonates are usually well-tolerated. Further, in our view, when one weighs the consequence of this disease to an aging skeleton, and the increasing life expectancy of the population, treatment is still indicated in the younger population in hopes of preventing progression to deformity, easing pain, and restoring bone remodeling to more normal levels.</p><p>The questions of which patients to treat and how intensive the regimen should be were examined in the multicenter Paget&rsquo;s disease: randomized trial of intensive versus symptomatic management (PRISM) in the United Kingdom, involving 1324 patients with known Paget disease (approximately equal numbers of men and women, mean age of 74, and enrollment regardless of treatment history or alkaline phosphatase level) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The findings suggested that outcomes in the intensive treatment arm to achieve and maintain a normal serum alkaline phosphatase were largely comparable to outcomes in the symptom-based treatment arm. Intensive treatment involved the use of bisphosphonates, preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a>, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. Symptomatic treatment involved the use of antiresorptive therapy (preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etidronate</a>, tiludronate, or subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>) only if pagetic bone pain did not resolve with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or analgesics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or opioids). Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were used if the first-choice antiresorptives were inadequate for pain relief. The results of the study showed alkaline phosphatase levels were lower in the group managed intensively, but there were no significant differences in other major outcomes, including fracture, need for orthopaedic surgery, quality of life, hearing, or bone pain.</p><p>Limitations in applying the findings of the PRISM trial include its design prior to the availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (zoledronate), resulting in the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> as first drug of choice, and the use in the symptomatic arm of less potent agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etidronate</a>, tiludronate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>. Additional concerns regarding reliance upon symptoms as the indication for treatment include the mechanical impairment of pagetic bone in this age group due to impaired bone architecture. Although treatment may normalize the rate of bone remodeling, it has not been found to eradicate the radiologic presence of pagetic bone, nor to improve deformity. These factors all predispose to fracture of pagetic bone with aging and to further deformity.</p><p>The problem with deciding which patient merits treatment is also complicated by the changing phenotype of Paget disease of bone. In a study of a well-defined population cohort from the Netherlands, Paget disease was substantially more common in patients with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level (relative risk [RR] 10.9, 95% CI 4.8-24.9), but the majority (about 86 percent) of patients with evidence of the disease had normal serum alkaline phosphatase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most countries are reporting a decline in prevalence and severity of Paget disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consensus treatment guidelines of the Endocrine Society clinical practice group, published in 2014, supported the use of bisphosphonate treatment as effective for preventing or slowing the progress of hearing loss and of osteoarthritis in joints adjacent to pagetic bone and noted that such therapy may reverse paraplegia associated with spinal Paget disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They also suggested treatment with a bisphosphonate before surgery on pagetic bone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic Paget disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose symptoms are caused by metabolically active Paget disease (usually associated with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of bone origin) should be treated. The most common symptom is bone pain at a pagetic site (eg, headache, limb, joint, or back pain, or radicular pain or neural impingement by pagetic bone). Symptoms and findings that may respond to pharmacologic treatment in patients with active disease include bone pain, symptoms of nerve compression, and radiographic findings of osteolytic bone lesions.</p><p>Patients with back or joint pain often have coexistent neuromuscular or joint disease, such as osteoarthritis, associated with nearby pagetic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The precise cause of pain in these patients may be difficult to determine, and a trial of bisphosphonate therapy is generally indicated, even if the serum alkaline phosphatase is normal.</p><p>When a bisphosphonate is prescribed for a patient with Paget disease of bone, treatment with this medication alone may prove insufficient to improve their functional status and relieve all pain. Bracing, canes, physical therapy, or medications for regional arthritis pain may still be required. (See <a href=\"#H172823156\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic Paget disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic Paget disease is detected on imaging studies performed for some other reason (eg, suspected kidney stones) or by the finding of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of bone origin, which is associated with metabolically active disease. Decisions regarding therapy in asymptomatic patients should take into account the location of the disease and the presence of comorbidities. Our approach to asymptomatic disease is consistent with the 2014 Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The main indication for treatment of asymptomatic Paget disease is biochemically active disease at sites where complications could occur (eg, skull, spine, weightbearing bones, and pagetic bone abutting a joint), as described in the preceding section on symptomatic disease. In asymptomatic patients with pagetic changes at other sites, it is reasonable to initiate therapy if the serum alkaline phosphatase is more than two to four times the upper limit of normal.</p><p>In patients with a normal serum alkaline phosphatase in whom a pagetic lesion has been detected incidentally, we suggest performance of bone scintigraphy. The bone scan can detect active disease and determine its extent. Antipagetic therapy should be initiated if involvement is at a site where complications could occur. If not, the patient should be monitored yearly for signs of progressive disease or functional impairment.</p><p>Other indications for treatment of patients with asymptomatic active Paget disease include planned surgery at an active pagetic site and the rare development of hypercalcemia in association with immobilization in patients with polyostotic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Hypercalcemia in an ambulatory patient suggests the presence of a second disorder such as primary hyperparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H172820504\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative antipagetic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For planned surgery at an active pagetic site, preoperative medical treatment to reduce abnormal bone turnover may be beneficial by reducing hypervascularity and possibly perioperative blood loss. In patients presenting with fracture through pagetic bone, formal recommendations to guide therapy are lacking. Treatment may be initiated once the patient is stable. (See <a href=\"#H172820504\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative antipagetic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172822526\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172820235\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of antipagetic medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drug selected for a given patient will be influenced by several factors, including the properties of the given drug, the burden of pagetic bone in the skeleton, and the particular circumstances of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. The newer nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> [zoledronate], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a>, and neridronate) are the primary agents used for the initial treatment of Paget disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. Simple bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> are used less frequently.</p><p>We take the following approach in patients in whom treatment is indicated (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals and indications for therapy'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older patients or in those with more extensive disease, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> rather than an oral bisphosphonate. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Zoledronic acid (zoledronate)'</a> below.)<br/><br/>Zoledronic acid is highly potent, has the advantage of being infused over 15 to 20 minutes, and produces the most sustained response among the available bisphosphonates. Biochemical remissions lasting up to one to two years are achieved in most patients after a single dose. In addition, zoledronic acid is effective in patients previously treated with other bisphosphonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Zoledronic acid (zoledronate)'</a> below.)<br/><br/>Zoledronic acid is generally preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> and oral agents because of its greater efficacy and ease of administration, especially in patients with more extensive disease and in those who are already on complex medication regimens for other conditions. The choice of zoledronic acid as the initial agent for most patients with active Paget disease is consistent with the clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In younger patients or in those with less extensive disease, the choice of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate can be based upon patient preference for intravenous or oral therapy, availability, and cost:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> may be preferred in younger patients with more limited disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Risedronate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Alendronate'</a> below.)<br/><br/>Overtreatment with oral medications should be avoided. In a managed care plan claims-based observational study of 433 patients with Paget disease, over 40 percent of those treated with an oral bisphosphonate received prescriptions for a duration beyond the recommended treatment regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients in whom intravenous therapy is preferred we generally use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Zoledronic acid (zoledronate)'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pamidronate</a> is an alternative intravenous agent, but it is less potent than zoledronic acid and takes longer to infuse. Also, some patients develop drug resistance. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pamidronate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Retreatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the rare patient intolerant of both parenteral and oral bisphosphonates, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Calcitonin'</a> below). Other alternatives include a simple bisphosphonate, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etidronate</a> or tiludronate, which may be tolerated in patients who are unable to tolerate nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Etidronate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Tiludronate'</a> below). Calcitonin is preferred in patients who are unable to take bisphosphonates; older patients with a guarded long-term prognosis due to comorbidities; patients with marginal renal function; and those in whom rapid easing of pain and disease activity, rather than achieving disease remission, is the goal of therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In previously treated patients with evidence of increased or recurrent abnormal bone turnover as determined by periodic serial measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, radiographic progression of disease, or recurrent pain, retreatment with bisphosphonates may be indicated. However, new symptoms that may respond to retreatment if due to Paget disease should be distinguished from secondary or unrelated changes that are not caused by current disease activity. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Retreatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesic, rehabilitative, surgical, and other measures may also be of benefit. (See <a href=\"#H172822682\" class=\"local\">'Secondary consequences of Paget disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Role of surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic kidney disease and an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates at the usual doses and administration times are contraindicated. In patients in whom a bisphosphonate is warranted clinically, it would require lower doses and longer infusion times to achieve a defined therapeutic target (eg, easing of pain) and monitoring carefully for the development of hypocalcemia and other adverse effects. This cautious approach, although imperfect, is necessary because these patients already have complicated metabolic bone disease and are vulnerable to antiresorptive therapy of any kind.</p><p/><p>The drugs used for the treatment of Paget disease are antiresorptive agents that target the osteoclast, which is considered the primary cell that mediates the high bone turnover that is characteristic of Paget disease. These drugs suppress bone resorption within days to weeks, as shown by decreased urine n-telopeptides or serum C-telopeptide (beta-CTX), followed by suppression of bone formation in weeks to months, with a reduction in the serum fraction of alkaline phosphatase that comes from bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A measurement of the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) level can help discriminate between liver and bone as the source of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase; it is usually unnecessary to order more expensive bone markers to determine this, as the GGT is elevated in liver disease but is not in disorders of bone. For a patient with both Paget disease and liver disease, measurement of the serum PINP level (procollagen type 1 propeptide) is recommended as a marker of a high bone formation rate.</p><p>The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are effective, are relatively safe, and have advantages compared with the simple bisphosphonates or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>, which is used infrequently. These medications have different mechanisms of action than the simple bisphosphonates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etidronate</a>, tiludronate), resulting in sustained suppression of bone turnover at doses that do not impair mineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

An observational study from Australia primarily using a postal survey of Australian Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons identified 158 patients with bisphosphonate-associated ONJ, eight of whom had Paget disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The usual initial dose is 50 to 100 units daily, as tolerated; the usual maintenance regimen is 50 units daily or 50 to 100 units every one to three days. Therapy is often continued indefinitely, since cessation typically results in recurrent disease activity.</p><p>The efficacy of parenteral salmon <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> was evaluated in a report of 85 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Markers of bone turnover, such as serum alkaline phosphatase or urine hydroxyproline excretions, were initially reduced by about 50 percent.

We do not routinely measure other markers of bone turnover, such as urinary pyridinium crosslink excretion, since there is no evidence that they are better measures of clinical response than serum alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with a sustained period of biochemical remission and histologic evidence of normal bone turnover; on the other hand, increases in serum alkaline phosphatase are consistent with increases in disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1,2,16,28,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16,28,58-60</a>]. Thus, as a marker of bone turnover, serum alkaline phosphatase can be used as an appropriate outcome measure when monitoring the biochemical response to bisphosphonate therapy. However, the serum alkaline phosphatase may not be useful as a marker of bone turnover in patients with limited disease or with normal serum alkaline phosphatase levels despite active disease evident by bone scintigraphy.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used to further characterize bone lesions if bone pain is refractory to medical therapy. Serial imaging studies, including bone scintigraphy, are not generally useful for routine monitoring of the response to treatment. However, bone scintigraphy may be helpful in monitoring the response to therapy after 6 to 12 months of treatment in the subset of patients with monostotic disease and normal bone turnover markers at baseline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">RETREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for retreatment with bisphosphonates generally depend upon evidence of increased or recurrent abnormal bone turnover, as determined by periodic serial measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, radiographic progression of disease, or recurrent pain. New symptoms, which may respond to retreatment if due to Paget disease, should be distinguished from secondary or unrelated changes that are not caused by current disease activity.</p><p>Some clinicians retreat patients only for symptoms related to Paget disease, while others retreat whenever the serum alkaline phosphatase becomes elevated above normal or rises to a significant degree above the previous nadir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. We take the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In middle-aged persons with active Paget disease by biochemical markers or active lesions on bone scan, periodic retreatment is indicated in hopes of preventing progression of deformity of bone with aging.

However, an infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> may prove more efficacious in this setting and is preferred in patients who require retreatment. Pamidronate resistance has been reported in patients previously treated with pamidronate, but the mechanism is unclear.

Factors that may pose additional challenges for the surgeon include the abnormal quality and hypervascularity of bone, bowing deformity of the limbs, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distortion of the acetabulum. Patients with Paget disease are also at increased risk for postoperative heterotopic bone formation following joint replacement surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with active disease in operative sites are at increased risk for blood loss, which may be decreased by preoperative antiresorptive treatment. We suggest that treatment with bisphosphonates be initiated three months prior to elective surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172823156\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (zoledronate), antipagetic interventions will usually be brief, be well-tolerated, and offer pain relief and sustained clinical remission. By contrast, progression of disease can occur in untreated patients, with extension of osteolytic lesions and progressive bony deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>In randomized clinical trials of the bisphosphonates in patients with Paget disease, outcome measures have included reduction in pain, reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, normalization of other bone turnover markers, the replacement of abnormal bone with normal lamellar bone, radiographic healing, and some improvement in measures of quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/1,2,5,12,16,17,27-29,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,12,16,17,27-29,58-60</a>] (see <a href=\"#H172821182\" class=\"local\">'Major comparative trials of nitrogen-containing bisposphonates'</a> above). Pain arising from pagetic bone usually responds rapidly to therapy, followed in weeks to months by gradual normalization of the serum alkaline phosphatase. Most studies have not been performed to confirm the expectation that bisphosphonate therapy will prevent long-term complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>].</p><p>The effects of bisphosphonate treatment on long-term complications were examined in a randomized, unblinded study, the PRISM study, involving 1324 patients followed for three years that found no evidence of reduction in the combined total of pagetic and nonpagetic fractures in patients treated based upon laboratory findings compared with those treated only for symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, there were a number of significant limitations to this trial that limit the conclusions that may be drawn from it, particularly for patients receiving initial therapy with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/6,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,63</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals and indications for therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, the structural integrity of pagetic bone is abnormal, and restoration of normal bone or disappearance of pagetic bone from radiographs following treatment with bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> has not been reported. This has implications for treatment outcomes, in that risk of fracture or arthritis is unlikely to be mitigated in all patients once deformation or incongruity of bone is present. Thus, in patients with established disease, aggressive treatment aimed at normalization of the serum alkaline phosphatase, rather than treatment for symptoms only, would not be expected to result in substantial differences in fracture rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Early treatment of Paget disease may have different implications in terms of prevention of complications, but further study is needed to determine whether this will be the case.</p><p>Some manifestations of Paget disease may also not be reversible. As examples, antipagetic therapy will rarely restore hearing, although it may stabilize hearing loss; it will not reverse deformity of bone or, as noted, all radiographic evidence of Paget disease on plain radiography; and it will not diminish the pain and dysfunction caused by secondary osteoarthritic changes. There are case reports of improvement in paraparesis or symptoms of spinal stenosis with bisphosphonate therapy, but there have been no comparative trials with other treatment modalities, such as surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paget-disease-of-bone/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].
