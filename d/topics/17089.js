The illness is less commonly diagnosed in the United States than in the developing world because of improvements in hygiene and rat control efforts. The actual incidence of murine typhus is difficult to establish since infection can be mild and self-limited, and clinically similar to other causes of rash and fever.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology and clinical manifestation of murine typhus. A discussion on diagnosis and treatment is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of murine typhus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Rickettsia typhi</em> is a member of the typhus group of rickettsiae that also includes the agent of epidemic typhus, <em>R. prowazekii</em>. These organisms are obligate intracellular, gram-negative bacteria that can only be grown in tissue culture, the cells of experimental animals, or chick embryos. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Murine typhus is primarily transmitted by the rat flea, <em>Xenopsylla cheopis</em>. Additional vectors include the cat flea, <em>Ctenocephalides felis</em>, and the mouse flea, <em>Leptopsyllia segnis</em>. Fleas remain permanently infected with <em>Rickettsia typhi</em>, and their lifespan is not shortened by the presence of rickettsiae. Humans are infected by inoculation of infective flea feces in bite wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The majority of cases of murine typhus are associated with sites in which rats accumulate in large numbers. However, in suburban locations in the United States, domestic cats, cat fleas, and opossums may maintain a cycle of both <em>R. typhi</em> and <em>Rickettsia felis</em> (a spotted fever group rickettsia that is flea-borne and produces an illness that is clinically indistinguishable from murine typhus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. House mice, cats, and shrews occasionally serve as hosts to infected fleas. In addition, domestic cats may have serologic evidence of infection with <em>R. typhi</em> in both endemic and nonendemic regions. In one study, cats were also shown to have detectable <em>R. typhi</em> DNA in their blood using molecular methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Other spotted fever group rickettsial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to serving as hosts for infected fleas, rats may become rickettsemic after contact with an infected flea and thereby transmit the organism to numerous simultaneously feeding fleas. The resultant amplification of rickettsiae may lead to rapid spread of infection to other rats.</p><p>Murine typhus is not reported in surveillance data collected by most state health departments. In the United States, most cases of murine typhus have been recognized and reported in Texas, California, and Hawaii, although it is likely that the disease exists in a much wider geographic area. Murine typhus is underdiagnosed because it is easily mistaken for a viral illness, because patients are rarely aware of having had flea bites, and because many cases resolve spontaneously. A serologic study of 513 children from south Texas found that approximately 13 percent of children ages 1 to 17 had IgG antibodies reactive to <em>R. typhi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Murine typhus sporadically occurs on all the inhabited continents, in environments ranging from hot to cold and from humid to semi-arid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is no seasonal variation in murine typhus in tropical areas, but in temperate regions the disease is most common in hot, dry periods, such as the late summer and early fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Outbreaks of murine typhus are uncommon. A report of a cluster of 53 cases of murine typhus in Austin, Texas suggested that a high density of infection in domestic animals or opossums may have been responsible for the hyperendemic foci of infection secondarily involving humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Murine typhus is occasionally contracted by travelers who then return to the United States with clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A limited number of autopsy studies of murine typhus cases have been performed due to the low case fatality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The primary pathological lesion of <em>R. typhi</em> infection is an inflammatory vasculitis characterized by perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma, and mast cells. In rare cases, vasculitis may be accompanied by mural or intimal thrombi in small vessels of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Murine typhus is typically a mild illness with an incubation period from 8 to 16 days. The onset of illness is usually relatively abrupt, with nonspecific symptoms followed by fever and a rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever, headache, chills, and myalgias are usually prominent early in the illness. Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea may also occur at this time. </p><p>Children with murine typhus also have headaches and myalgias, but are more likely to have abdominal pain and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one series, GI symptoms occurred in 77 percent of 97 infected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rash occurs in some patients near the end of the first week of illness. The frequency has ranged from 20 percent in a report from Thailand to 54 percent in a series from Texas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>]. The clinical triad of fever, headache, and rash was noted in 49 percent of patients in the pediatric series cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and only 35 percent (184 of 525 patients) in a systematic review of the clinical features of murine typhus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The rash of murine typhus typically begins as a maculopapular eruption on the trunk and spreads peripherally, sparing the palms and soles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67425 \">picture 1</a>). However, the pattern of evolution and distribution is sufficiently variable to preclude their use in differential diagnosis. The rash may be faint and difficult to see, particularly in dark-skinned individuals. In one study of 180 patients, for example, rash was observed in only 20 percent of black patients compared to 81 percent of white patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The rash has a petechial component in less than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the majority of patients experience mild illness, mental confusion and focal neurologic symptoms can rarely lead to diagnostic confusion. For example, one case report described a patient with murine typhus who developed facial paralysis and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hepatic, cardiac, renal, and pulmonary dysfunction can occur in severe cases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal dysfunction, which was present in one-fourth of cases in one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], can result from several mechanisms, including decreased renal perfusion (prerenal) and acute interstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Microscopic hematuria and proteinuria may occur in up to one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with more severe illness may develop cough and dyspnea. Chest radiographs in such patients may show interstitial infiltrates or changes suggestive of pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rarely, pleural effusions and even respiratory failure have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in other rickettsial diseases, ocular exam may show a variety of abnormalities ranging from exudates to hemorrhages to optic disk or vitreal inflammation. These changes are secondary to the widespread vasculitis that is the hallmark of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative bradycardia has been observed in hospitalized patients with murine typhus, but the overall frequency of this finding is unknown as most studies do not mention whether this finding was specifically or critically examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenomegaly has been detected in 15 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other rare complications include septic shock with multiorgan failure and hemophagocytic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>As in other rickettsial diseases, the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) and advanced age appear to be host factors associated with severe or fatal disease. The association with G6PD was first described in a black American soldier who developed acute renal failure and severe hemolysis after contracting murine typhus in Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Several subsequent studies showed an association between G6PD deficiency and severe or fulminant Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and severe infection with the agent of boutonneuse fever (<em>Rickettsia conorii</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The mechanism of this association between severe rickettsial diseases and the presence of G6PD has not been conclusively established, but it has been proposed that G6PD-associated hemolysis may somehow aggravate or potentiate rickettsia-induced vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine laboratory findings in murine typhus are nonspecific.

The white blood cell count is usually normal but mild leukocytosis or leukopenia may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hyponatremia, hypoalbuminuria, elevated creatine kinase levels, and abnormal liver function tests are frequently present, although these abnormalities are usually mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].
