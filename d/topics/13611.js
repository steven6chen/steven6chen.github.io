The changes of photodamage are superimposed on the changes caused by chronologic aging (the so-called intrinsic or programmed aging) and are responsible for most of the age-associated features of skin appearance. Salient clinical features of photoaging include fine and coarse wrinkles, dyspigmentation, and loss of elasticity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging#H23810980\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p>Photodamage can be partially prevented and reversed with proper sun protection and various prescription medications. However, concerns about photoaging are primarily cosmetic and are influenced by geographical differences, culture, and personal values. </p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and medical treatment of photoaging will be discussed here. Procedural techniques for the treatment of photoaging, including laser therapy, injection of soft tissue fillers, and botulinum toxin, are discussed separately.

In European and North American adult populations with skin phototypes I, II, and III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), the prevalence of clinically detectable photoaging may be as high as 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Risk factors for photoaging include older age, male sex, skin phototypes I to III, high occupational or recreational sun exposure, and living in geographic locations with high sun irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Individuals with fair and less pigmented skin are at increased risk for photodamage and sun-induced skin cancer. The amount of time spent in the sunlight over a lifetime is a key risk factor for photoaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of basal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Geographic and ethnic variation'</a>.)</p><p>In an Australian study, skin texture changes of moderate to severe photoaging were observed in 72 percent of men and 47 percent of women under the age of 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The severity of photoaging increases rapidly after the age of 30 and is associated with medium or light skin color, burning and never tanning after exposure to strong sunlight, and prolonged occupational or recreational sun exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In populations with darker skin, wrinkling is not readily apparent until the age of approximately 50 years, and the severity is not as marked as in light-skinned populations of similar age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One study found that the onset of wrinkles in Chinese women occurred on average 10 years later than in French women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in Chinese women, the appearance of hyperpigmented spots was an earlier and more prominent sign of photoaging than in French women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16665018\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of the structural integrity of the dermal extracellular matrix caused by chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure is believed to be primarily responsible for the wrinkled appearance of photodamaged skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The dermal extracellular matrix is a complex meshwork of several macromolecules, including collagen and elastic fibers, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans, which provide strength and resilience to the skin. Type I and III collagens are the most abundant proteins in the dermis and the main target of sun-induced damage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3041232109\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultraviolet radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) appear to be implicated in the photoaging process, although UVA is emerging as the major contributor to photodamage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. UVA (320 to 400 nm) is thought to have a larger role than UVB in photoaging because it is able to penetrate into the dermis deeper than UVB and is at least 10-fold more abundant than UVB in the terrestrial sunlight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Short wave UVB (290 to 320 nm) are mainly absorbed in the epidermis by cellular DNA. They induce direct DNA damage with formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts and are responsible for sunburn, inflammation, photocarcinogenesis, and immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. UV radiation also indirectly damages DNA. The absorption of UVA photons transfers electrons and energy from cellular chromophores, such as porphyrins, bilirubin, melanin, and pterins, to oxygen molecules, resulting in the formation of singlet oxygen. Long wavelength radiations in the infrared (IR) range, which represent 50 percent of the total solar energy, may also contribute to photoaging of human skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the UV-mediated damage to the skin connective tissue involve the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell surface receptor-initiated signaling, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. ROS, including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, activate cell surface receptors for cytokines and growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin (IL)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. ROS also induce the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) and the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78164 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>AP-1 upregulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), including interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), and 92kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The combined actions of MMP-1, 3, and 9 degrade most of type I and III dermal collagen. With repeated sun exposure, the degraded collagen accumulates over time, resulting in the clinical and histologic features of photoaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. AP-1 also inhibits type I and type III procollagen gene expression in the dermis by binding to the transcriptional complex responsible for procollagen transcription or blocking the activity of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and various adhesion molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These cytokines in turn upregulate AP-1 and further activate the NF-kappa B pathway, enhancing the response to UV irradiation. </p><p>Mitochondria are the main endogenous source of ROS, which are produced during the conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Endogenous ROS, particularly singlet oxygen, may induce deletions and rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA (tDNA). The most common mitochondrial mutation is a 4977 base-pair deletion termed &quot;common deletion,&quot; which is found with high frequency in degenerative diseases and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This mutation is increased in photodamaged skin and may be induced in dermal fibroblasts by repetitive exposure to UVA radiation. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Furthermore, it has also been observed that large blocks of genomic hypomethylation occur in photoaged skin similar to those seen in cutaneous carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H908426476\"><span class=\"h2\">Other environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to sun exposure, several environmental factors may contribute to premature aging of the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Air pollution</strong> &ndash; There is growing evidence that exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants, including lead, particulate matter (soot, exhaust, industry), nitrogen oxide (car exhaust), sulphur oxide (industrial plants), and ozone (ground level), may contribute to skin aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. The association between air pollution and premature skin aging is supported by several epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35</a>]. In vitro studies suggest that the ozone-induced activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and cytochrome P450 may lead to the production of metabolites of air pollutants that are toxic to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tobacco smoke</strong> &ndash; The role of smoking in accelerating skin aging is corroborated by observational and epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/3,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37-39</a>].

The mechanism of tobacco smoke leading to facial wrinkling is poorly understood but is thought to involve impaired collagen biosynthesis and collagen degradation through induction of matrix metalloproteinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5836769\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopic changes in the photodamaged skin include epidermal atrophy with thinning of the spinous layer, flattened dermoepidermal junction with loss of rete ridges, decreased collagen content, and deposition of amorphous masses of abnormally thickened, curled, and disintegrated elastic fibers and collagen breakdown products (solar elastosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83455 \">picture 1</a>).

Factors to consider in the management of a patient with photoaging include the severity of skin changes and the patient's concern, expectations, and willingness to accept the costs of treatment. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in the management of photoaging involves educating the patient to adopt appropriate year-round sun protection measures, including sun avoidance, regular use of sunscreen and protective clothing, seeking shade, and avoiding peak sun hours. (See <a href=\"#H16665039\" class=\"local\">'Photoprotection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical retinoids are the mainstay of medical therapy for patients with mild to severe photoaging. The use of a topical retinoid in the evening should be tailored to the patient&rsquo;s skin type and ability to tolerate the medication. (See <a href=\"#H11545631\" class=\"local\">'Topical retinoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is interested in pursuing additional therapies, options such as chemical peels, injectables, lasers, and photodynamic therapy and their potential adverse effects should be fully discussed with the patient. (See <a href=\"#H1477721042\" class=\"local\">'Other therapeutic options'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A variety of other substances called cosmeceuticals, which include antioxidants, vitamins, or plant extracts, are incorporated in cosmetic preparations and have been used in conjunction with topical retinoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83291 \">table 3</a>). However, there is limited evidence from clinical studies to suggest that they are beneficial or that one particular preparation is better than another.

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation tends to be the strongest at peak hours (10 AM to 4 PM), during summer months and at high altitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Water, snow, and concrete can reflect up to 90 percent of the UV rays, whereas shade decreases the amount of UV by 50 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Staying away from the sun in the peak hours or seeking shade may considerably reduce sun exposure.</p><p>We suggest daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreens, which provide protection against ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73127 \">table 4</a>), to prevent premature aging of the skin. Sunscreen use is especially important for individuals with light skin (phototypes I, II, and III) who live in areas with high levels of solar irradiation. It is important to note that most people do not apply an adequate amount of sunscreen. Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or greater or applying a lower SPF sunscreen twice may ensure proper protection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures#H9546113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of sunscreen and sun-protective measures&quot;, section on 'Proper use of sunscreens'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized, community-based trial in Nambour, Australia, participants &lt;55 years were randomly assigned to daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of 15+ and 30 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, daily use of sunscreen and placebo, discretionary use of sunscreen and 30 mg of beta-carotene, and discretionary use of sunscreen and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Participants in the daily sunscreen group were instructed to apply sunscreen to their head, neck, arms, and hands every morning, with reapplication after heavy sweating, bathing, or spending more than a few hours outdoors. To assess photoaging, silicone impressions of the skin surface markings were obtained from the back of the left hand at baseline and at the end of the study and graded on a scale ranging from 0 to 6. After 4.5 years, participants in the daily sunscreen group, with or without supplementation with beta-carotene, were less likely to have an increase in photoaging grade than participants in the discretionary sunscreen group (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.50-0.98).

In human skin, topical retinoids increase collagen production, induce epidermal hyperplasia, and decrease keratinocyte and melanocyte atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1104917962\"><span class=\"h3\">Pretreatment counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to counsel patients before initiating treatment with topical retinoids. Patients should be informed that local skin irritation can be expected as part of the treatment. Skin irritation, redness, scaling, dryness, burning, stinging, and peeling are common side effects of topical retinoids and often result in patient nonadherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Adverse effects peak during the first two weeks, are more frequent with higher concentrations, and decrease with time. Regular application of moisturizers is helpful in reducing irritation from topical retinoids. </p><p>Treatment with topical retinoids should not be started or continued during pregnancy because retinoids are known teratogens. However, there is no direct evidence that topical retinoids cause congenital malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photoaging/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9275666\"><span class=\"h3\">Tretinoin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical tretinoin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70303 \">table 5</a>) as first-line therapy for photoaging.
