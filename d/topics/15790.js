A systematic review of 17 studies in patients with ESRD indicated that &quot;sleep disturbance&quot; was one of their most common symptoms, with a mean prevalence of 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sleep disorders tend to be under-recognized by renal healthcare providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews sleep disorders among ESRD patients, including insomnia, excessive sleepiness, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and periodic limb movement (PLM) disorder. Sleep disorders in the general population are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-sleep-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of sleep disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619098\"><span class=\"h1\">INSOMNIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of insomnia among ESRD patients treated with conventional hemodialysis or chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) ranges from 19 to 71 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-14</a>]. Insomnia is a significant source of stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>] and has been associated with increased mortality among ESRD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. The mechanism by which insomnia increases mortality among such patients is not clear, but may be via an increase in systemic inflammation, which has been associated with both ESRD and poor cardiovascular outcomes among ESRD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271949745\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contributors to insomnia include restless leg syndrome (RLS); periodic limb movement (PLM); sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]; metabolic factors, including uremia, anemia, hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], bone pain, and pruritus; anxiety and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]; circadian rhythm disorders, such as delayed-sleep phase syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]; the use of medications that prevent sleep; and poor sleep hygiene, including frequent napping during daytime dialysis.</p><p>Elevated plasma levels of orexin (a neuropeptide that promotes wakefulness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] may also contribute to poor sleep among ESRD patients. The diurnal rhythm of melatonin is disturbed in patients with ESRD, and it is also related to the degree of kidney dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some studies have suggested that the timing of the dialysis shift alters the severity of insomnia such that insomnia is worse among patients who are dialyzed in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>], but this has not been shown in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619126\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients complain of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and early-morning awakening. In addition to subjective sleep complaints, there is objective evidence of both sleep loss and sleep disruption among ESRD patients who are treated with conventional hemodialysis (defined by three times weekly in-center hemodialysis). Polysomnographic studies have reported lower than normal total sleep time (4.4 to 6 hours per night), fragmented by a high frequency of arousals (up to 30 per hour), resulting in low sleep efficiency among ESRD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,31,32</a>].</p><p>In one study that compared ESRD patients treated with conventional hemodialysis with otherwise matched non-ESRD controls, ESRD patients were more likely to have short sleep (odds ratio [OR] 3.27, 95% CI 1.16-9.25) and less efficient sleep (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.5-19.6), even after adjustment for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and known sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Sleep architecture varies between studies, but, generally, stages 1 and 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are increased, whereas slow-wave sleep and REM sleep are reduced among patients on hemodialysis compared with the non-ESRD population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619140\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of insomnia is not different among ESRD patients than in the general population and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619147\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of insomnia among ESRD patients is generally the same as in the non-ESRD population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, an important component of treatment that is specific to ESRD patients is the optimization of renal replacement therapy.</p><p>The benefit of renal replacement therapy in insomnia has been evaluated in a few studies. In one retrospective study that utilized a 10-symptom questionnaire called the Pittsburgh Symptom Score to assess uremic symptoms among 45 patients, symptoms including &quot;trouble sleeping&quot; and &quot;restless legs&quot; improved nine months after the initiation of CAPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The optimal modality of renal replacement therapy for the treatment of insomnia among ESRD patients is not clear. A single, randomized, multicenter study compared the effect of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) with CAPD on subjectively described sleep quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among 25 patients who completed the study, 13 were allocated to CAPD and 12 to APD. APD consisted of nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis supplemented by additional daytime manual exchanges, if required, to meet a minimum dialysis target. Both groups achieved the same mean weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> (of approximately 2.3) over a six-month period. There was no difference in sleep quality at baseline or at six months.</p><p>Nocturnal hemodialysis improves sleep apnea but has the potential to cause sleep disruption for other reasons. This was suggested by one study that included 14 patients who were switched from conventional hemodialysis to nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although all patients had improved sleep apnea, there was no improvement in polysomnographic features of sleep fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One reason for the persistent sleep disruption observed in this study is that the reduction in respiratory arousals, associated with improvement of sleep apnea, was replaced by an increase in spontaneous arousals and in arousals associated with PLM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].<strong> </strong>Experience from clinical practice has also suggested that home dialysis has the potential to disrupt sleep in some patients, most often due to technical difficulties with the mode of dialysis (eg, alarms or discomfort due to body or arm positions), as well as to anxiety about receiving dialysis during the night.</p><p>The effect of renal transplantation on sleep quality has been evaluated in a few studies. Among 115 transplant recipients, poor sleep, assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, was reported in 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, it is not known whether transplantation (which was performed at least six months prior to the study) caused any change in sleep quality since a baseline assessment prior to transplantation was not obtained.</p><p>However, another study, which assessed insomnia with the Athens Insomnia Scale, reported a lower prevalence of insomnia (8 percent) among kidney transplant recipients compared with waitlisted dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619154\"><span class=\"h1\">EXCESSIVE SLEEPINESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive sleepiness is defined as the inability to stay awake or alert during the major waking episodes of the day, resulting in unintended lapses into drowsiness or sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subjective daytime sleepiness is commonly reported among ESRD patients who are treated with conventional hemodialysis or chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 54 outpatient hemodialysis patients, daytime sleepiness was the most frequent complaint (67 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another study of 78 stable patients on maintenance hemodialysis found that 31 percent of the patients reported excessive daytime sleepiness, assessed subjectively by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].<br/><br/>In another study of 24 unselected hemodialysis patients, daytime sleepiness assessed by ESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] was reported in 50 percent of patients, and objective sleepiness assessed by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] was found in 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].<br/><br/>In one study, among 46 hemodialysis patients who had no known cause of daytime sleepiness (such as chronic medical disorders associated with sleep disruption, central nervous system medications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history suggestive of sleep disorders), 50 percent of patients had sleep apnea, and 50 percent had periodic limb movement (PLM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thirteen percent of patients had evidence of &quot;pathological&quot; sleepiness, and 33 percent had mild daytime sleepiness. In addition, 48 percent of patients had rapid eye movement (REM) sleep on at least one nap, and 17 percent of patients had REM sleep on two or more naps. REM sleep generally does not occur during daytime naps in a healthy, well-rested individual. REM sleep can occur during daytime naps due to sleep deprivation, sleep disruption, circadian rhythm disorder, narcolepsy, and withdrawal from REM sleep-suppressant medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep#H630021601\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;, section on 'REM sleep (stage R)'</a>.)<br/><br/>In this study, the high prevalence of REM sleep during daytime naps may have reflected the severity of nighttime sleep disruption or, alternatively, may indicate a basic desynchronization of the timing of REM sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 201 CAPD patients, sleepiness was the most frequent sleep-related complaint (77 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 81 CAPD patients, 52 percent reported involuntary sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Among 18 patients who had further evaluation with overnight polysomnography and MSLT, 11 (61 percent) had sleep apnea. Sleep latency was lower among patients with apnea compared with those without apnea (5.5 versus 7.7, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619168\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple ESRD-related factors contribute to sleepiness. Such factors include uremia, high prevalence of PLM, and high prevalence of sleep apnea. In the study cited above, analysis of the MSLT data indicated that sleepiness was associated with both higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and higher frequency of PLM, suggesting that uremia and sleep disruption associated with PLM contribute to the pathogenesis of sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Sleep apnea contributes to daytime sleepiness among ESRD patients. In one study cited above, objective sleepiness correlated with the severity of sleep apnea and the frequency of arousals on the overnight polysomnogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, although mild sleep apnea was present in some patients, the respiratory disturbance index, which is a measure of apnea frequency, accounted for only 11 percent of the variability in the measures of sleepiness, which suggested that nonrespiratory factors may contribute to sleepiness.</p><p>Other contributors to daytime sleepiness may include subclinical uremic encephalopathy; deficiency of tyrosine, which is an important precursor in the metabolism of dopamine; release of sleep-inducing inflammatory cytokines during dialysis; persistence of melatonin during the daytime; and alteration of body temperature rhythm, which is closely associated with the sleep-wakefulness rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619175\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness is manifested by falling asleep involuntarily in either passive (eg, reading, watching television) or active (eg, driving, during conversation) situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H362471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Increased daytime sleepiness may lead to decreased productivity at work or even to an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. Its potential clinical significance varies depending on each individual patient&rsquo;s circumstances. Excessive sleepiness has been correlated with increased mortality in a cohort of ESRD patients receiving treatment with chronic hemodialysis in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, among ESRD patients, the modality of renal replacement therapy may influence daytime sleepiness. Nocturnal hemodialysis may have a beneficial effect on daytime sleepiness. This was suggested by one study in which 15 ESRD patients were assessed by overnight polysomnography and MSLT before and after they were converted from conventional to nocturnal hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Prior to conversion of their dialysis treatment, patients were categorized into a somnolent group and an alert group based on the results of an MSLT. In the somnolent group, there was a trend for the frequency of PLM to fall and a corresponding trend for sleep latency to increase; whereas, in the alert group, there was a trend for the frequency of PLM to increase and a corresponding trend for sleep latency to fall. When the data from these two groups were combined, a significant correlation was found between the change in PLM and the change in sleep latency. These data suggest that sleepiness may improve following conversion to nocturnal hemodialysis, possibly related to reduced sleep disruption associated with PLM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258227629\"><span class=\"h1\">SLEEP APNEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep apnea is a chronic medical disorder in which patients stop breathing during sleep. There are two types of sleep apnea, both of which are found in patients with ESRD. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs due to intermittent closure of the upper airway during sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs due to intermittent loss of respiratory drive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;mixed apnea&quot; is used by polysomnographic technologists when they score apneas that start as a central event and finish as an obstructive one. It is not a distinct clinical entity, nor should it be confused with patients who have both OSA and CSA that occur separately on the same sleep study.</p><p>The severity of sleep apnea is defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The AHI is calculated from a sleep study and describes the frequency of apneas (complete absence of airflow for 10 seconds or more) and hypopneas (partial reduction in airflow for 10 seconds or more) per hour of sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H3891977\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Measures of sleep-disordered breathing severity'</a>.)</p><p>Untreated sleep apnea has many potential clinical consequences among patients with ESRD. Sleep apnea may exacerbate the symptoms of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as daytime fatigue, sleepiness, and impaired neurocognitive function, which could impair health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Similar effects on cognitive function have been described in CKD stages 4 and 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The prevalence of OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia increases with declining renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In addition, sleep apnea may exacerbate the cardiovascular complications of CKD, as well as ESRD, which are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. In patients with normal renal function, OSA independently increases the prevalence of systemic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>],<sup> </sup>and cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] and also exacerbates myocardial ischemia in patients with coexisting coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a>.) In a study of stable kidney transplant recipients, the presence of sleep apnea was associated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>OSA has been identified as a source of increased oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] and systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], which may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Published data about the association between sleep disorders and inflammation among CKD patients, however, are conflicting, with some studies reporting no association between sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, and inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Among patients with ESRD, hypoxemia during sleep is associated with nocturnal hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired sympathovagal balance, and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>].</p><p>Sleep apnea may increase the risk of death among ESRD patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F87179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87179 \">figure 1</a>).

The observation of both OSA and CSA in ESRD patients supports the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of sleep apnea among ESRD patients is due both to destabilization of central ventilatory control and upper-airway occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20,80,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,80,83</a>].</p><p>Enhanced ventilatory sensitivity to hypercapnia that correlates with apnea severity has been reported in ESRD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Enhanced ventilatory sensitivity to hypercapnia destabilizes respiratory control by increasing a phenomenon known as loop gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.) A reduction in ventilatory sensitivity to hypercapnia has been demonstrated among ESRD patients whose apnea improved when they were switched from conventional to nocturnal hemodialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F87084\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87084 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Among such patients, the reduction in ventilatory sensitivity correlated with a reduction in apnea severity, as reflected by a fall in AHI.</p><p>Alternatively, patients with ESRD may develop sleep apnea through mechanisms that promote upper-airway occlusion during sleep. Such patients are vulnerable to fluid overload, which could contribute to pharyngeal narrowing by causing interstitial edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased fluid volume in the neck and peripharyngeal structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. In healthy subjects, displacement of fluid from the lower limbs has been reported to increase neck circumference and pharyngeal resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] and reduce upper-airway cross-sectional area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Studies have suggested that a similar mechanism is operative among patients with ESRD. As an example, pharyngeal cross-sectional area was measured with acoustic pharyngometry in 44 hemodialysis patients and compared with a control group with normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Pharyngeal area was smaller among the hemodialysis patients, suggesting that such patients may be predisposed to upper-airway occlusion during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Furthermore, conversion of ESRD patients from conventional hemodialysis to nocturnal hemodialysis was associated with an increase in pharyngeal cross-sectional area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], possibly due to improved fluid removal. Conversion from CAPD to nocturnal peritoneal dialysis has also been shown to reduce the frequency of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The decreased prevalence of OSA among nocturnal peritoneal dialysis patients was associated with better fluid clearance and reduced pharyngeal narrowing, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In one study, the upper-airway mucosal water content and jugular volume correlated well with the severity of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Upper-airway mucosal water content was related to nocturnal rostral fluid shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>], and improvement in fluid overload following hemodialysis was associated with a reduction in the severity of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H258227686\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Another potential cause of pharyngeal narrowing is upper-airway dilator muscle dysfunction due to neuropathy or myopathy associated with chronic uremia or the underlying cause of ESRD, such as diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Both sensory neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>] and muscle denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>] have been demonstrated in the upper airway in OSA patients with normal renal function and may exacerbate the disease process in ESRD patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258227665\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, common signs and symptoms of OSA include loud snoring, witnessed episodes of apnea, morning headaches, and sleepiness or poor concentration during the day.

The treatment of sleep apnea utilizes the same measures that have been shown to be effective in the general population.

Although sleep apnea is not corrected by conventional hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal hemodialysis, which enables patients to receive hemodialysis at home during sleep, may improve sleep apnea. In one study, among seven subjects changing from conventional three times weekly hemodialysis, nocturnal hemodialysis was associated with a reduction in the AHI (approximately 46 to 9 per hour, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, as noted previously, although nocturnal hemodialysis may reduce sleep apnea, it has the potential to cause sleep disruption for other reasons. More recently, fluid removal by a single night of ultrafiltration has been shown to improve OSA in ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26619147\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients treated with nocturnal cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis have also been shown to have decreased prevalence and severity of sleep apnea compared with those on CAPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The improvement in sleep apnea was attributed to more effective fluid removal and its impact on the upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>It is not clear whether transplantation improves sleep apnea.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Quality of life'</a>.)</p><p>Kidney transplantation has been associated with an improvement in both RLS and PLM in several small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/110,119,124-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,119,124-126</a>].</p><p>Correcting iron deficiency, which is quite prevalent in individuals on maintenance dialysis, with intravenous iron has been shown to improve RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p>Moderate, regular exercise has been shown to improve symptoms of RLS in the non-ESRD population (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H1663800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a>). A randomized, controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in RLS symptoms with progressive exercise among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Twenty-five stable hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to a progressive exercise group (consisting of 45 minutes of intradialytic cycling against progressive resistance applied at 60 to 65 percent maximum exercise capacity) or control (intradialytic cycling without any resistance). At six months, there was an improvement in the IRLS score in the progressive exercise group, but not in the control group. Another study has shown that exercise training is equivalent to dopamine agonists in relieving RLS symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26619252\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disorders are common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and tend to be under-recognized by renal healthcare providers. Sleep disorders include insomnia, excessive sleepiness, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome (RLS). (See <a href=\"#H26619091\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia is a significant source of stress and has been associated with shorter survival among ESRD patients. Causes of insomnia include RLS and periodic limb movements (PLM), sleep apnea, metabolic factors, bone pain and pruritus, anxiety and depression, circadian rhythm disorders, medications, and poor sleep hygiene, including frequent napping during daytime dialysis. Patients complain of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and early morning awakening. (See <a href=\"#H271949745\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26619126\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among ESRD patients, the treatment of insomnia is directed at optimizing renal replacement therapy, as well as utilizing nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions, which are employed for the treatment of insomnia in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H26619147\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive sleepiness is defined as the inability to stay awake or alert during the major waking episodes of the day, resulting in unintended lapses into drowsiness or sleep. Subjective daytime sleepiness has been associated with higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN), higher frequency of PLM disorders, and sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"#H26619154\" class=\"local\">'Excessive sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea among ESRD patients is due both to destabilization of central ventilatory control and upper-airway occlusion. Volume overload and neuropathy or myopathy associated with chronic uremia or the underlying cause of ESRD may contribute. (See <a href=\"#H258227658\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ESRD patients may not have the typical manifestations of sleep apnea, and objective monitoring may be required to exclude the diagnosis. The evaluation of patients with possible sleep apnea is the same among ESRD patients as in the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to treat sleep apnea for the reduction of cardiovascular risk should be individualized for each patient. In general, the treatment of sleep apnea is the same among ESRD patients as in the general population. Among patients on conventional, three times weekly hemodialysis, sleep apnea may be improved by switching to nocturnal hemodialysis; however, nocturnal hemodialysis has the potential to cause sleep disruption for other reasons. Among patients on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), switching to nocturnal peritoneal dialysis may improve sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RLS refers to complaints of an unpleasant sensation in the legs (and occasionally in the arms), accompanied by an urge to move them, typically in the evening or early part of the night, that is worse during periods of inactivity and transiently relieved by movement. Factors that exacerbate, if not cause, these sleep disorders among ESRD patients include anemia, iron deficiency, elevated serum calcium, and peripheral and central nervous system abnormalities. RLS is associated with difficulty initiating sleep, poor sleep quality, impaired health-related quality of life, and depression.
