The majority of compound presentations consist of a fetal hand or arm presenting with the vertex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of this uncommon intrapartum problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2955973809\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compound presentation complicates from 1 in 268 to 1 in 1000 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539709866\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of clinical settings can lead to compound presentation via different pathways.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fetal extremity has room to descend when the fetus does not fully occupy the pelvis because of prematurity, multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, or a large maternal pelvis relative to fetal size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow of amniotic fluid after rupture of membranes when the presenting part is still high can carry a fetal extremity, umbilical cord, or both toward the birth canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During external version, a fetal limb (commonly the <span class=\"nowrap\">hand/arm,</span> but occasionally the foot) can become &quot;trapped&quot; below the fetal head and thus become the presenting part when labor ensues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although rare, the head of the first twin and an extremity of the second twin can present together within the birth canal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3110068794\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antepartum, compound presentation may present as an incidental finding on ultrasound examination. Antepartum or intrapartum, it may be palpated as an irregular shape beside or in advance of the vertex or breech during a cervical examination, but may not be recognized through a long, closed cervix.</p><p>Intrapartum, the clinician should consider the possibility of compound presentation when the vertex remains persistently unengaged after rupture of membranes or when protraction or arrest occurs in the active phase. In the second stage, arrest of descent may also be associated with a variant of compound presentation in which the fetal hand fills the space between the vertex and the maternal sacrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of compound presentation is based on identification of one or more fetal extremities presenting alongside or in front of the vertex or breech presentation on physical examination or ultrasound examination (vaginal or abdominal).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2697259741\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete or incomplete breech presentation may be misdiagnosed as <span class=\"nowrap\">foot/cephalic</span> compound presentation. An ultrasound examination or careful digital examination will lead to the correct diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2557040401\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTEPARTUM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antepartum identification of compound presentation usually does not require any interventions or monitoring. If noted on ultrasound examination immediately following an otherwise successful external cephalic version, the compound presentation will usually resolve spontaneously. In this setting, if a foot or hand is preventing the vertex from settling into the inlet, we have found vibroacoustic stimulation useful in prompting fetal movement sufficient to resolve the problem.</p><p>If a compound presentation is identified on ultrasound examination in a patient with polyhydramnios, the patient should be counseled on the risks of prolapsed umbilical cord and fetal extremity if membranes rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umbilical-cord-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Umbilical cord prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAPARTUM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approaches to intrapartum management of compound presentation are based on patient-specific factors, clinical experience, and insights from case reports and small series, given the infrequent occurrence of this problem. High-quality data to guide management are not available.</p><p>Some experts recommend attempting to gently reposition the fetal extremity, while others discourage this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/3,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-11</a>]. For women with normal progressing labor, we favor observation alone. Occasionally, the presenting part will simply push the extremity aside or the fetus will retract the extremity as labor progresses. The author chooses not to pinch the presenting part in an attempt to provoke the fetus into withdrawing the presenting part, although this practice is unlikely to be harmful.</p><p>A persistent compound presentation is likely to result in dystocia. If descent of the presenting part slows or arrests, we gently push the small part up into the uterine cavity while simultaneously applying fundal pressure to effect descent of the vertex. If the compound presentation does not resolve after this gentle maneuver, we have a low threshold for proceeding to cesarean delivery because of the increased risk for obstructed labor and an adverse outcome (see <a href=\"#H2926452095\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> augmentation should be avoided as it may lead to uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2926452095\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases of compound presentation, labor results in an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. No large contemporary series of compound presentation have been published. A case report of a patient with a compound presentation and protracted labor described entrapment of the fetal arm between the head and bony pelvis, which may have been the cause of ischemic necrosis of the arm; limb amputation was required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another case report described a vacuum-assisted delivery in which an unrecognized compound presentation resulted in a rectal laceration; the fetal hand was found to be protruding through the anus as the head was crowning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These two case reports, and others, underscore the need for operative intervention if the compound presentation does not resolve spontaneously or with gentle pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/compound-fetal-presentation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2277596111\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Predisposing factors include prematurity, multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, a large pelvis, external cephalic version, and rupture of membranes at high station. (See <a href=\"#H2955973809\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1539709866\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A compound presentation may present as an incidental finding on ultrasound examination or it may be palpated as an irregular shape beside or in advance of the vertex or breech during a cervical examination.
