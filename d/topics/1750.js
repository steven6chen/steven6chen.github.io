The word is derived from the Greek &quot;balanos,&quot; which means &quot;acorn.&quot;</p><p>When the prepuce (foreskin) also becomes involved, the condition is known as balanoposthitis. In common usage, &quot;balanitis&quot; and &quot;balanoposthitis&quot; are interchangeable, although balanoposthitis occurs only in uncircumcised males. For the remainder of this discussion, we will refer to both conditions using the term &quot;balanitis.&quot;</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of balanitis in adult males will be reviewed here. The disorder in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanoposthitis-in-children-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanoposthitis in children: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanoposthitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanoposthitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, balanitis accounts for approximately 11 percent of men seen in urology clinics. Approximately 3 percent of uncircumcised men are affected globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Balanitis appears to be more common in men of African American and Hispanic descent, although this observation may be related to differences in circumcision rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H501780791\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Balanitis has a wide range of causes, but most cases are related to inadequate hygiene in uncircumcised men. When the foreskin is not routinely retracted and the glans is not cleansed in an appropriate fashion, buildup of sweat, debris, exfoliated skin, and bacteria or fungi can occur, resulting in inflammation. Predisposing factors include diabetes mellitus, trauma (eg, zipper injury), obesity, and edematous conditions (eg, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome).</p><p>Of cases with identifiable etiologies, candidal infection is the most common. Various other infectious agents, dermatologic conditions, and premalignant conditions have been associated with balanitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/3-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-19</a>]. Chronic balanitis may predispose to premalignant and malignant lesions, but there is contradictory evidence on this topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. An organizational scheme is included as part of the 2013 European guideline for the management of balanoposthitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113319\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113319 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49586791\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of balanitis generally evolve over three to seven days. It often presents as pain, tenderness, or pruritus of the glans <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foreskin. Physical examination shows erythema, which may be associated with a curd-like or purulent exudate, ulcerations, or other findings depending upon the etiology. For example, candidal balanitis may have a white curd-like exudate, whereas anaerobic bacterial infections often manifest with a thick foul-smelling purulent exudate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61240\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61240 \">picture 1</a>). Circinate balanitis, which presents with shallow ulcers on the glans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62093 \">picture 2</a>), is generally associated with reactive arthritis. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection may present similarly.</p><p>Localized edema may develop if balanitis is allowed to progress without treatment. The combination of inflammation and edema can result in adherence of the foreskin to the glans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23</a>]. Persistent inflammation may result in scarring. Ultimately, this process can evolve into tightening of the foreskin, known as &ldquo;phimosis.&rdquo; Phimosis is an abnormal constriction of the opening in the foreskin that precludes retraction over the glans. Paraphimosis, which refers to trapping of the foreskin behind the glans penis, requires urgent reduction. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Balanitis is sometimes associated with other symptoms, including painful joints, more generalized dermatitis, mouth sores, swollen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> painful glands, and malaise or fatigue. These findings, if present, may help elucidate the underlying cause. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3779194107\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Candida</em> colonization of the penis occurs in 15 to 20 percent of men and is more common in diabetic persons and in individuals who are uncircumcised or who have partners with recurrent vaginal candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. <em>C. albicans </em>is the dominant species.</p><p>Symptomatic candidal infection typically presents with a painful or pruritic erythematous rash; a white curd-like exudate is sometimes present. Pruritus and burning are most noticeable after sexual intercourse. Physical examination may reveal the presence of small papules with blotchy erythema and an eroded, dry, or glazed appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>].</p><p>The development of balanitis or phimosis in an otherwise healthy man can be the first presentation of diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Poorly controlled blood glucose is associated with proliferation of candidal species beneath the foreskin, which may lead to balanitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289703543\"><span class=\"h2\">Less common etiologies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2177764898\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial and other infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaerobes have been reported as a cause of balanitis (with mixed species, which may include <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>), especially in uncircumcised males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Subpreputial anaerobic infection can result in a foul-smelling discharge, inflammation and edema of the <span class=\"nowrap\">glans/foreskin,</span> erosive lesions, and inguinal lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61240\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61240 \">picture 1</a>). Group A streptococcus and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, which are common skin pathogens, can also be responsible for balanitis. They present with erythema and edema. Sexually transmitted pathogens, including <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, HSV, human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, scabies, and <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, may also cause this condition.</p><p>The other clinical manifestations associated with these organisms is discussed elsewhere.

It is also known in men as balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), which is analogous to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in women. BXO often presents with white penile lesions, pruritus, painful erections and voiding, and bleeding or ulceration with intercourse. There can be blisters, ulceration, or hemorrhagic vesicles. The foreskin can become thickened and phimotic, and urethral strictures can develop. There is a 1 percent risk of malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma cell (Zoon&rsquo;s) balanitis</strong> &ndash; Plasma cell (Zoon&rsquo;s) balanitis is a disease of older men who are uncircumcised. It presents as symmetrical, well-marginated erythema of the glans and foreskin and may be confused with carcinoma in situ (CIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contact dermatitis</strong> &ndash; The typical appearance of an irritative or allergic reaction can range from slight erythema to severe penile edema. The history will often include frequent genital cleansing with soaps. If a specific agent is identified, patch testing can be conducted to determine the presence of an allergy.

There may also be a serpiginous annular dermatitis that often has a grayish white granular appearance with a &quot;geographical&quot; white margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Circinate balanitis, when occurring as a component of reactive arthritis, is often a self-limited condition but can persist for several months. Men with circinate balanitis associated with reactive arthritis may also have other genital symptoms, including dysuria, penile discharge, and prostatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional clinical manifestations of reactive arthritis are discussed elsewhere.

A fixed drug eruption is characterized by the recurrent appearance of skin lesions at the same site each time the offending agent is administered. The lesions develop over the course of 30 minutes to eight hours. They often manifest as round or oval plaques with erythema, edema, and sharply defined borders. The most commonly offending agents are tetracyclines, salicylates, phenacetin, phenolphthalein, and some hypnotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31-33</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;</a>). The pathophysiology of balanitis as a manifestation of a drug eruption is not well understood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Balanitis should be suspected in men who complain of penile pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> redness. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of an inflamed and erythematous glans on physical examination. For men who are uncircumcised, mobility of the foreskin should be assessed to exclude phimosis and paraphimosis (trapping of the foreskin behind the glans) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76100 \">picture 3</a>), which are complications of balanitis. Paraphimosis requires urgent urologic consultation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Although many cases of balanitis in uncircumcised males are the result of inflammation from rubbing of the foreskin against the glans (sometimes with superimposed fungal or bacterial infection) and will respond to local hygiene measures, history and physical examination findings sometimes point to other etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113318 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113420 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In particular, certain historical (eg, diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, obesity) or examination (eg, white, curd-like exudate) features raise suspicion for candidal infection, the most common identified etiology of balanitis. If available, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) stain can be examined by microscopy for budding yeast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pseudohyphae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79879\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79879 \">picture 4</a>). Patients with candidal balanitis with no identifiable predisposing conditions should be screened for diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>History and physical examination findings sometimes point to other etiologies that have management implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. History should assess the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as any underlying dermatologic (eg, eczema, psoriasis) or systemic (eg, reactive arthritis) diseases. Beyond inspection of the glans and foreskin, physical examination should include assessment of the urethral meatus for inflammation and discharge, as well as extragenital manifestations (eg, generalized rash, oral ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy, arthritis).</p><p>A dermatologic cause, allergic reaction, or (less likely) premalignant condition may also be responsible. In some cases, a dermatologic cause (eg, psoriasis or lichen planus) is evident based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions and their presence elsewhere on the body. Referral for dermatology or urology consultation and biopsy is recommended for nonresponders to topical corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1447654840\" class=\"local\">'Less common etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p>In particular, small, shallow, painless ulcerative lesions on the glans penis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62093 \">picture 2</a>) are suggestive of circinate balanitis, a particular type of balanitis associated with reactive arthritis. There may also be a serpiginous annular dermatitis that often has a grayish white granular appearance with a &quot;geographical&quot; white margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This lesion can be mistaken for psoriasis on physical examination, and histological evaluation cannot reliably distinguish between the two disorders. Biopsy of circinate balanitis can show pustules in the upper epidermis, similar in appearance to pustular psoriasis. The distinction between circinate balanitis and psoriasis is generally made by the clinical context (eg, if the patient has known reactive arthritis or psoriasis). If circinate balanitis is suspected clinically in a patient without known reactive arthritis, screening for STIs and testing for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is advised.</p><p>Additional evaluation may be warranted based upon the history and physical findings. This might include bacterial culture (in the presence of purulent exudate), herpes simplex virus (HSV) testing (in the presence of vesicular or ulcerative lesions), syphilis testing (in the present of an ulcer), testing for scabies, and testing for trichomonas and <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> (in the presence of urethritis). Details of diagnostic testing of these infections is discussed elsewhere.

In addition, empiric treatment for candidal infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> noninfectious dermatitis is warranted in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113420 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Attention to genital hygiene is the most important approach for most men with balanitis. Retraction of the foreskin with thorough genital cleansing can be both preventive and therapeutic. Twice-daily bathing of the affected area with saline solution should be encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balanitis-in-adults/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>].

Overuse of detergents, soaps, perfumes, condoms, and other chemicals (spermicidal agents, petroleum jelly), similar to poor hygiene, can also result in inflammation to the skin of the <span class=\"nowrap\">glans/foreskin</span>. In addition, dermatitis can result from irritation secondary to the shearing effects of clothing.</p><p>In uncircumcised males, nonspecific balanitis may respond to saline solution bathing alone. In circumcised males and in uncircumcised males who do not respond to saline solution bathing, we suggest empiric treatment for candidal infection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a> 1% cream or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miconazole</a> 2% cream twice daily for seven days (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Candidal infection'</a> below).

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Paraphimosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Phimosis can be treated in the emergent setting by dilation using a surgical clamp and pain medication. In the event this is not successful, a dorsal slit circumcision can be performed by a urologist to temporize the problem.

The constricting foreskin has become located proximal to the glans penis. Under these circumstances, the constricting band will limit the venous and lymphatic outflow while allowing continued arterial inflow. Over the course of minutes to hours the glans will increase in size and become exquisitely painful. This must be addressed by a urologist with reduction of the paraphimosis.

Of cases with identifiable causes, candidal infection is the most common. Various other infectious agents, dermatologic conditions, and premalignant conditions have been associated with balanitis. An organizational scheme is included as part of the 2013 European guideline for the management of balanoposthitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113319\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113319 \">table 1</a>).

If balanitis is a manifestation of reactive arthritis, it may be associated with joint inflammation, mouth sores, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination should include inspection of the glans and foreskin and the urethral meatus for <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/discharge</span>.
